GID00086210	We are out of here, you're not turning us into one of your experimental zombies. Did you actually think we would buy into that biological warfare shit? We will take our chances outside.

GID00086213	Ground House Entrance
GID00086214	1. Down the Train Tunnel - couldn't find it before, maybe they cleared away some of the debris, they have had plenty of time
GID00086215	2. Transformer Station? There was a destroyed building above the tunnel entrance, maybe it was underneath that
GID00086216	3. The utility shaft in the train tunnel? I thought that was just ventilation
GID00086217	4. Maybe another entrance, the lake water was flowing somewhere, an underwater cave?
GID00086218	Trail Log 17 of 43: Dr Fent's Work Notes
GID00086219	One of the prisoners has offered some of his friends as part of a deal. I thought this was very good, so as I seem to keep losing things, I have decided to keep him in a box in case he comes up with another good deal.
GID00086220	As a gesture of goodwill I will also give his friend his arm back. Well, another arm as I eaten the first one. Fortunately I have plenty of spare parts.
GID00086221	Attaching an arm requires delicate micro surgery so I used my best blow torch, although the patient seemed to object. On considering his objections I agreed that we should go for the full upgrade complete with an extra arm and power steering and I also have a spare combustion engine. I think he agreed judging by the look on his face when I showed it to him. He simply asked where I was going to put it, so I told him.
GID00086222	The procedure did not start well as I couldn't find his gear box, despite having a good rummage around. After this I decided to give the patient a local anaesthetic. I knew that battery acid would come in useful.
GID00086223	I wonder if I can find any white wall tyres? That would really cheer him up.

GID00086226	Warning Note
GID00086227	Tell Jerry he can store his precious robots in the cistern if he wants to. Just make sure no one shuts off the waterfall, cause with the high water that place will fill up in seconds and I don't think they are amphibious.
GID00086228	Note
GID00086229	Don't worry about the robots.
GID00086230	I've locked out the sluice gate controls so they can't be operated accidentally and set the gates, outflow open, cistern closed. The only way the cistern can be flooded is if someone was to operate the emergency override valves so it was the other way around and what idiot would do that? I've locked the door anyway.
GID00086231	Note
GID00086232	Business seems to be picking up. I use to just get a few raiders and the odd prospector, but recently I've had some NCR, quite a few Vipers and it looks like there is another group up at the diner.
GID00086233	I'll pick out a tasty looking one, I'm going to start to put on weight if I'm not careful!
GID00086234	I'll go at dawn to wait for this lot, I couldn't make them all out last night and I need to check they are not with Angel, but I did see a man and a women shooting up and they look like Raiders to me. Should be easy. I'll leave the oven on.
GID00086235	Supplies
GID00086236	Need to cook up some more of my special meat pies. Angel should be coming past before long and I need to trade for some ammo. Evidently there is a raider crowd down the road who are quite partial to my cooking. Just as well some more ingredients have turned up.

GID00086239	We have a plan. We have a way out and have dug out information on some government facility called 'Ground House', which might just suit our needs.
GID00086240	Burgess Diary 1 - Deja vu
GID00086241	Never thought I would be back here again. 
GID00086242	I've done some scouting for an NCR big cheese, they pay well for someone who gets results and can keep their mouths shut. But when they mentioned a VaultTec vault up in the mountains north of Vegas... it would have made my hair stand on end if I had any.
GID00086243	Burgess Diary 2 - Vegas Research
GID00086244	I needed to bring my own knowledge up to date and I've got some information from a hobo in Westside. Most thought he was just another bum with a treasure map but I recognised some of the info as solid. He was quite forthcoming once I had slapped him around a bit. 
GID00086245	I need to head back that way, gather more information, do some research. There is another loose end I would like to tie up as well.

GID00086249	---------------------------------
GID00086250	Its been 6 years since I sent Bennet and his three stooges up to check on 'Ground House'. I know they got there as they sent a message back saying there was now a place called Rita's Cafe built on it. Then nothing. I would of known if they had returned, I would have picked them up in Vegas.
GID00086251	Fucking amateurs. I knew I shouldn't have given them the access codes.
GID00086252	Burgess Diary 3 - Payday
GID00086253	I've passed on what I've acquired to some NCR drone called Kelly. His merry band are off to make their fortune and have no idea what is waiting for them. Not sure myself to be honest.
GID00086254	I'm really tempted to go and watch how this all pans out as it would be quite entertaining, but I need to keep my distance. I'll pick up the pieces later when they have all knocked themselves out.
GID00086255	Burgess's Instructions
GID00086256	Bennet
GID00086257	Listen you idiot, check out the local area and find out if anyone ever managed to find or access this 'Ground House'. I've told you where its likely to be if it does exist.
GID00086258	I know this is difficult for you but try and be discreet. If its still a possibility let me know, I'll deal with it personally. DO NOT GO IN.

GID00086261	Now I’m the new security chief we can get this vault in order. I never liked the Captain and all his military bullshit, this is a VaultTec facility and should be ran as such.
GID00086262	What’s more Dr Nice has been making some real advances in his research. I’ve been with him a long time and potentially we could be around for a lot longer. Not sure about the overseer though, I don’t think he understands the bigger picture of what Dr Nice is trying to achieve.
GID00086263	V616 Security Log Entry 06
GID00086264	We have shut up the Overseers office as instructed by Dr Nice. 
GID00086265	When he saw what was inside he found it funny, it was the first time I’ve seen him laugh. I thought he might want to use it, but he wasn’t interested so it’s just been sealed. It’s too near the atrium anyway, I hate those lights used to keep the trees alive.
GID00086266	I always thought the Overseers office had a secret exit anyway? I'm sure I've seen something about one. I would look but if he never used it then I guess I must be mistaken.
GID00086267	V616 Security Log Entry 07
GID00086268	We have just found this kid in the sewer, screaming for help. How the hell did he get there? Claims he found some sort of service tunnel and fell down a shaft. Must be talking about one of the water intake shafts, I didn’t think it was possible to get in that way. More importantly he has been singing like a canary and says he wasn't alone, so I've stepped up the security patrols. I'm sure this young fellow will prove to be useful as well.
GID00086269	V616 Security Log Entry 08
GID00086270	This latest group of scavengers are much more organised than any we have encountered before. Some of them appear to be wearing a uniform of some description, these must be the ‘New California Republic’ creatures we have heard about.
GID00086271	With this increased threat I’ve ordered a lock down. Elevators to be disabled and corridors to be locked when not required. We will see how they get on with the external defences before we take direct action.
GID00086272	I tried to consult with Dr Nice but he hasn’t been himself recently.
GID00086273	V616 Security Log Entry 01
GID00086274	2086
GID00086275	The first excursion outside the vault has been authorised. The mission is to check the local area only, basically the train yard.
GID00086276	The overseer was surprised by this, evidently exploratory reconnaissance from the vault were not in VaultTecs operating procedures. They are in military ones though and that’s what I'm going by. 
GID00086277	It seems the local area wasn't badly affected by the war, which is odd. I was expecting a nuclear wasteland, but instead we found the area simply derelict through lack of maintenance. There is evidence of some low level looting, which indicates a human presence still and we did find some strange fauna and flora around. I wonder what condition Vegas is in?
GID00086278	We didn’t detect any coherent radio transmissions, but we are not in a particularly good area in these mountains.
GID00086279	We secured the train yard, checked the defence systems, which were all in good order and withdrew as per orders. Personally I think we should have gone further, but I think the overseer is understandably worried about contamination. This disease that has appeared isn’t going away.
GID00086280	V616 Security Log Entry 02
GID00086281	2091
GID00086282	It’s time for another recon outside the vault. We are authorised to explore a little further this time and check the valley entrances.
GID00086283	The west route has been blocked by landslides, but the east is clear. I would use the rail road though and avoid the car tunnel. There is a lot of water coming through the tunnel lining and it has started to erode it, especially around the east end. I’m guessing the war must have brought about some pretty harsh weather conditions.
GID00086284	That disease has taken hold now. Strangely, although I’m not an expert, we can detect no trace of it out here, but I guess the doc knows what he is doing. Strict decontamination procedures are being kept.
GID00086285	V616 Security Log Entry 03
GID00086286	2096
GID00086287	Time for another recon. The Overseer is really against these excursions and the Doc seems reticent about them. Must be down to this disease which keeps re-occurring, but I insisted. We can’t stay in this vault forever can we? By my calculations we are due to exit in about 20 years.
GID00086288	We went out as far as Sawmill Junction. Importantly we found traces of a large group that had passed through this area recently and judging by what we found they were probably from a vault but we couldn’t determine which one. It appears they were heading north, not sure if they were heading towards something or away from something. Again some more of this mutated wildlife, even a plant that spits some sort of venom.
GID00086289	Supplemental
GID00086290	Further reconnaissance have now been banned on orders from the overseer and Dr Nice.
GID00086291	The pair of them have put their foot down. I can fight vault bullshit with military bullshit but not medical bullshit as well.
GID00086292	V616 Overseer Log Entry 01
GID00086293	2081
GID00086294	We have been sealed in for a while now and its all pretty calm. We have heard nothing from the outside at all, not even any explosions. I guess the vault was built well. No communications at all though.
GID00086295	The experiments have been delayed, still some more background research to be done evidently. Dr Nice, our resident chief scientist, is organising the details. He keeps to himself, a very driven man. A geneticist and one of the team involved in finding a cure for the new plague I understand. Specialising in something called the Pan-Immunity Virion, whatever that is.

GID00086297	2084
GID00086298	The first test batch has begun on members of the subject group. I was a bit taken aback when I first heard about these vault experiments but once it sank in I was quite exited. This is cutting edge stuff.
GID00086299	I was a little disappointed when I found out what my vault was to do. Physiological studies. Longevity, increasing endurance, that kind of stuff. I had managed to sneak a peak at some other projects, experiments in psychology, sound, I thought I saw something about puppets somewhere, but I must have misread that. Ours seemed a bit tame by comparison, but at least I'm part of it, or supervising anyway. I not sure I would want to be one of those poor fools actually involved in it. Not until it’s all proven safe anyway.
GID00086300	V616 Overseer Log Entry 03
GID00086301	2088
GID00086302	The experiments have been going well, we have had some extremely good results but also some rather disturbing side effects. Skin problems, sensitivity to light and more. Some of the subjects are also demonstrating some strange behavioral patterns as well. Some quite disturbing, we have had to restrain one.
GID00086303	Dr Nice seems to have it covered though, he has been treating them with some sort of blood product. Animal blood doesn't do it, has to be human but then isn't that what the control group is for? We just give them the biological warfare and faulty filters story to keep them on side.
GID00086304	V616 Overseer Log Entry 04
GID00086305	2091
GID00086306	The security chief keeps insisting on recons outside the vault. It’s not in the vaults operating instructions but there are conflicting orders from military directives. I want to stop this as it could endanger the experiment and I was hoping for some backing from Dr Nice but I think he is letting his curiosity get the better of him.
GID00086307	I’ll work on the pair of them, but I need to be careful with the chief as he is not actually fully informed to our primary directives. Army man, not VaultTec, he was a poor choice for the job.
GID00086308	V616 Overseer Log Entry 05
GID00086309	2102
GID00086310	I don't believe it! A whole group of people have fled the vault!
GID00086311	I knew something was going on but I didn't realise that there was that many involved. The White family, the Lewis's, the Dunn's, Susan Hicks, David Burgess, Michael Dolan, mostly the control group but not all. The Trapps went as well, although they were only just started on the 'treatment'.
GID00086312	They didn’t have any problems breaching security as the chief, Andrew Poke, was one of them! No wonder I was in the dark about it, fucking traitor. I thought he was acting strange.
GID00086313	They won’t last long outside though. There has been some petty pilfering from the stores but nothing to sustain them for long. 
GID00086314	This has really jeopardised the experiment and is causing all sorts of problems, we needed their blood. If we catch any of them I'm going to drain them personally.
GID00086315	V616 Overseer Log Entry 06
GID00086316	2102
GID00086317	I authorised a patrol to go outside and check for the missing members, but not to go too far. They didn't find them, not that I was really expecting them to.
GID00086318	On the plus side they did pull in a couple of other locals. Sorry looking pair, didn't get much useful information out of them but plenty of blood. That will help.
GID00086319	V616 Overseer Log Entry 07
GID00086320	2104
GID00086321	Things have been getting pretty bad around here. Some of the local 'livestock' we have been pulling in are keen drug users and this is causing Dr Nice all sorts of problems. We have started to keep them in pens to 'dry' out but this takes time and not all survive.
GID00086322	What's more I have found out that some personnel have been actually eating them as well. What the hell is going on? There is no food shortage. Dr Nice, surprisingly, wasn't at all shocked by this, just rambled on about side effects and hormones, but I know I didn't damn well authorise it. And what did he mean about 'known' side effects?
GID00086323	I'll talk to the new chief of security, for what it's worth. I found out a while ago that he was brought here by the Doctor and in all likelihood is his man. What a mess, I really need to sort these people out and re-assert my authority. This current state of affairs will not do.
GID00086324	V616 Overseer Log Entry 08
GID00086325	2106
GID00086326	It’s all fallen apart, there has been a mutiny.
GID00086327	I confronted Dr Nice today. Part way through the conversation I realised he had been taking his own treatment, I could see it on him. They have kept it so dark in here because of the other patients I hadn’t noticed but when I got up close...my god, even the security personnel are using. Nice said it was the only way forward if we are to survive and had me scheduled to start soon! 
GID00086328	No way. I’m not taking that shit, it’s not even been proven to work. I know of other places outside the vault I might be able shelter in. The details were stored in the train yard office but should have been deleted and moved to the vault mainframe, I have the access code for the file in my safe.
GID00086329	As for getting out of here, there is an emergency evacuation store and exit I can access from this office, I just never expected to have to use it. 
GID00086330	How did it come to this?
GID00086331	V616 Overseer Log Entry 09
GID00086332	2106
GID00086333	I’ve been utterly betrayed. When I checked the emergency store I realised how Poke and his traitors planned to escape and survive. They had taken everything. Looted the entire stock. How did they know about it? Why did I never check it?
GID00086334	I can’t even get out, they have locked the emergency exit from the outside, the bastards. I've tried to find a way through the lock but I can't. They have killed me. 
GID00086335	It won’t take Nice and his cronies long to get in here, they have already shut off all the main system functions in this office from the mainframe. I’m not going to be turned into one of them. And they are not going to use me like those others they drag in. I’m going to take every drug I’ve got, then finish it.
GID00086336	I would tell them all to go to hell, but we are already here.

GID00086344	Martin, 
GID00086345	1. We have halted further construction work on Stone case, cutbacks, what can I say? Remaining funds are to be used making what we have useable.
GID00086346	2. You can abandoned further stocking as only limited stores are to be transferred to this location. They want to spread everything out a bit as a precaution, but we will use the Bank Vault as that is fully functional.
GID00086347	3. Security is now to be automated only as according the psychologist report there is a 72% chance of the security team killing each other after 1 year inside and a 93% chance they will just steal everything. You just can’t get the staff these days.
GID00086348	4. Further to the above, make sure there is a password on the robot systems terminal. As it is, if someone got into the basement level they could probably switch them all off

GID00086360	I need to be careful what I write on the security office terminal, I know the Overseer can access it if he really wants too as well as personal terminals.
GID00086361	No body comes up to this level much any more and as security its my job to check this area. I can work here.
GID00086362	V616 Security Log Entry 04
GID00086363	2096 Security Log Supplemental
GID00086364	I looked around the church, which was in a pretty bad way, and recovered some scraps of paper and anything that could give an idea to what is going on outside of the vault. I was breaking the rules, but I did it anyway, I had already sent the others back to the vault.
GID00086365	From what I could gather society has pretty much fallen apart, which isn’t surprising, but I could find no reference to any sort of plague or disease.
GID00086366	On route back to the vault I came across a ‘survivor’ who was living in a cave above the old car tunnel. He froze when he saw me, I guess the whole spacesuit look freaked him out. I managed to calm him down a bit and get some information from him before he ran off.
GID00086367	He confirmed that the other group was also from a vault and its people from vaults he is scared of, said we were all diseased or crazy but the symptoms of these other vault occupants bore no relation to ours. What’s more he stated that no such infections occurred in any of those people he knew. Could this be purely a vault problem? And if so how did it occur?
GID00086368	This leads to some very awkward questions.
GID00086369	V616 Security Chief Personal Log Entry 02
GID00086370	2097
GID00086371	I’ve been talking with one of our chief engineers, Charlie Dunn. Clever guy, but a bit of a militant and as security chief we are normally at odds with each other. But I need his help so it was time to put aside our differences and Charlie loved the irony of me rebelling.
GID00086372	I need to find out what is going on and Charlie, with my help, is the man who can get into the vault systems to find out. Turns out he already knows about a few things he shouldn’t, including some things I didn’t know.
GID00086373	It’s time to answer those awkward questions.
GID00086374	V616 Security Chief Personal Log Entry 03
GID00086375	2098
GID00086376	Well, I wanted to find out what was going on and I have. What do they say? Be careful what you wish for.
GID00086377	I finally got to the Overseer's terminal and I read it over and over but still couldn't believe it. We are nothing more than fucking lab rats. How the hell did they ever think they could get away with it? But then they have haven't they?
GID00086378	I need to concentrate on what do next, what I can do something about, not what I should do, which is to kill these VaultTec drones. I have to focus.
GID00086379	I can't trust most of my security team as they are all VaultTec. I'm the odd one, last minute replacement drafted in from the Army. Need to work out who I can trust then get us out of here. Need to get people to trust me, Jesus, I was part of this.
GID00086380	This will not look good on the resume.
GID00086381	Ris Note
GID00086382	We are running a bit short on ammo again so I'll have to send someone over to fucking Blu Ray to trade for some more. I would love to take that bastard down but he's the only place we can get ammo from. Even Angel gets most of her stock there. Anyway, that house is a fucking bunker.
GID00086383	Maybe we should wait for Angel anyway, she'll put a mark up on stuff, but every time I send one of these Muppets over there, they go sniffing around and end up getting killed.
GID00086384	Talking of Angel, I wonder where she gets her pies from? Sure taste good.
GID00086385	Research project Vera 1
GID00086386	My first real attempt at recreating Vera.
GID00086387	By chance I noted that one of the raider characters at the bridge bore a significant resemblance. It was at this point I first considered the possibility of bringing Vera back to life, in a manner of speaking, so I attempted to isolate the individual in question and recover her back to my lab for further tests. 
GID00086388	The initial phase was successful with the application of the correct medication, which she was surprisingly happy to self administer. However once the medication started to wear off the subject became quite uncooperative and aggressive and I was forced to kill her, which is something of a setback. Never the less, I kept her in stasis in hope of still taking the project forward.
GID00086389	Supplemental Note:
GID00086390	It seems my stasis pod is not functioning at optimum efficiency and this oversight has probably put paid to this project phase. Undaunted I shall move forward with phase 2 and a new approach.
GID00086391	Research project Vera 2
GID00086392	I have managed to obtain some research material and hardware from the actual Sierra Madre thanks to my source in Hayford, although the price has been considerable. This may actually realise a recreation of Vera in holographic format which should be far easier to manage in terms that I will not have to shoot her to ensure her cooperation.
GID00086393	I have made good progress but there are still the following serious problems to be overcome.
GID00086394	Issue 1: The obtained, but non-functional holographic projector is the size of a small cooking pot whereas my device would not fit in a kitchen. I need to source smaller components.
GID00086395	Issue 2: The obtained holographic projector allowed the holograms to move around and, to a degree, interact with their surroundings. My hologram just stands there saying and doing very little and is restricted within the projector. And to be honest she is a bit blotchy as well. This is dreadfully disappointing.
GID00086396	Research project Vera 3
GID00086397	A chance encounter in Hayford gave rise to an unplanned resurrection of the Vera 1 project. 
GID00086398	Again this project has proven to be problematic as the subject is once more uncooperative, despite an initial assessment that promised otherwise.
GID00086399	This time however I shall be more patient and move things forward at a slower pace. To be more organised I have separated difficulties in a separate entries.
GID00086400	Research project Vera 3a
GID00086401	Issue 1: She doesn't behave like Vera
GID00086402	Subject behavioural analysis has revealed very few Vera like attributes overall. I have attributed this down to lack of cooperation but have made some progress In the area from the subject by administering the following items:
GID00086403	A. Chems. This generally works quite well although the subject generally starts behaving much the same as subject 2 and in effect ceases to function.
GID00086404	B. Alcohol. Can sometimes have the desired effect but can be unpredictable.
GID00086405	C. Caps. This by far produces the best results but after the acquisition of the products from the Sierra Madre I have very little left.
GID00086406	Research project Vera 3b
GID00086407	Issue 2: She doesn't look like Vera
GID00086408	Solution: dress & wig. Cannot be considered a permanent solution although it seems to work reasonably well as long as I keep at least 30m away from her.
GID00086409	Research project Vera 3c
GID00086410	Issue 3: She doesn't talk like Vera
GID00086411	She does not have the same voice as Vera and since becoming sober has expressed a number of opinions on myself and my research. I am sure that Vera Keyes would not have made the declaration that I 'blow goats'. However, I do have to admit, I don't understand what this statement actually means, although it does not sound positive. A temporary solutions is the same as issue 2 except to increase the distance to 50m as she can shout quite loudly.
GID00086412	Research project Vera 3d
GID00086413	Issue 4: She doesn't smell like Vera
GID00086414	I'm sure the original Vera did not smell like a Brahmin although I cannot confirm this as I can find no information on Vera Keyes's aroma, data on this specific area is frustratingly limited.
GID00086415	The subject herself suggested a solution in the form of a bath but I am loathed to take advice from someone without a scientific background. A temporary solution is the same as issue 2. 
GID00086416	Research project Vera 3e
GID00086417	Issue 5: Her name isn't Vera
GID00086418	I should have paid more attention when she approached me in Hayford. She was already under the influence of alcohol and when I asked her name she stated that she was whoever I wanted her to be. When she then gave her name as Vera I should have recognised that this information was of dubious authenticity.

GID00086452	Lillypad Field
GID00086453	The place is called Lillypad field. You reach it via a cave that goes up behind the waterfall, the entrance is behind Greta's bus, it's marked on your gadget and I've given you the key.
GID00086454	I reckon 20 raiders/walking plants or whatever you want to call them and 10 of those spitting plants. They may be awkward to find, but they shouldn't have any problems finding you. If you get stuck just run around, you'll see them. Kill them all then come and see me.
GID00086455	There is a old hunting shack down the south end of the field. The key is in a pot by one of the doors. As a gesture of good faith you can use it and help yourself to whatever is in there.

GID00086461	Damned if I can work out what this is the code to. Belonged to Grandpa who didn't know what it was for either.
GID00086462	But he did say he got it from his Grandpa and for some reason it seemed to amuse him. Old boy was probably senile, I should throw it away.
GID00086463	Orders
GID00086464	57465890 Capt Kelly.M
GID00086465	Kelly, I want to make clear to you the priorities of this mission.
GID00086466	I've stuck my neck out for this, getting resources without getting noticed is a pain in the ass so make the most of it. Buy what and who you have to, but remember the coffers are not bottomless and keep as low profile as you can. As far as command is concerned this is just another recon mission and they don't need to know any different. And keep away from any Rangers, those boys have no business sense.
GID00086467	1. Confirm if this VaultTec vault information is true, I don't want to waste time chasing another goddamn tall story.
GID00086468	2. If you find it and its already been burned and looted, check it out but do not waste any more time on it than you have to. If we can cover our expenses that will do.
GID00086469	3. If its still sealed, find a way in and establish if there is anyone inside. I know that might not be easy, but you have shown aptitude in the past and I'm sure you won't let me down.
GID00086470	4. If its empty, catalogue the state of the facility and what is worth selling and keeping. If the place is serviceable, it may be worth selling to whoever offers the most, I've a contact that can deal with the details.
GID00086471	5. If its occupied then send in whatever scum you have hired to clear the place out. I don't want to be troubled be any vault dwellers looking for handouts. Once done revert to the above instruction.
GID00086472	6. Once the situation is finalised get rid of any of the hired crap that is left and pay off those troops that were in on the mission. I'll sort out the discharge papers for them. Make sure they know to keep their mouths shut.
GID00086473	We get this right and with a bit of luck we won't need our pathetic little NCR pensions. Don't get it wrong, our backer does not like fuck ups. It looks bad to voters. 
GID00086474	Col F
GID00086475	Capt Kelly - Log Entry 01
GID00086476	I was concerned when our initial recon party, or what was left of it, returned and reported another group in the area. It would appear they were also looking for the vault and quite organised. I thought this vault was meant to be undisclosed? 
GID00086477	The survivor confirmed the Train Yards existence but that's it. Sometimes I feel I'm wasting my time with these idiots. Fortunately our other source is more reliable.
GID00086478	Capt Kelly - Log Entry 02
GID00086479	So far progress has been good. It’s never easy dealing with hired mercenaries, particularly this Viper scum, but for this kind of mission it is necessary. They are generally easy to dispose of as well once their purpose has been served.
GID00086480	We have reached a settlement of sorts called Hayford. Not much here except for our contact who exchanged the last of his information for payment. I was curious to how he got it but he was keeping his mouth shut. That's one of the reasons we pay him ironically. Can't stand Ghouls anyway.
GID00086481	Up ahead the road is blocked by raiders. They are well positioned but we have the resources to deal with them and it will make for a good shake down and see if we can drill this rag tag outfit into shape.
GID00086482	Capt Kelly - Log Entry 03
GID00086483	We have located the Train Yard and sent in another recon. We have lost  more personnel than I anticipated on route to raiders, random snipers, etc. The last one was particularly nasty but now we can get on with the business in hand.
GID00086484	Capt Kelly - Log Entry 04
GID00086485	I've made this cave complex our HQ for the meantime as it suits our purpose quite well and we are not the first to use it, there was quite a lot of materials already here we could salvage.
GID00086486	I've held off moving into the train yard as our reconnaissance showed there were quite a few service tunnels around plus defences, robotic it would appear. Any way I don't want any damn robot popping out of the wall when I'm trying to manage this operation.
GID00086487	Capt Kelly - Log Entry 05
GID00086488	We have found no trace of the other group our recon clashed with, other than some trash dumped in this cave as it would appear they also used it. There was some sort of diary entry as well but it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. Pity.
GID00086489	On the plus side we have lost a few Vipers to the vault defences so the prognosis is good as it would indicate the vault is still intact. 
GID00086490	Capt Kelly - Log Entry 06
GID00086491	It appears our sniper at the church has returned. He caused us some casualties on our way in and gave us the slip when we cleared the area, but now it seems he is back, the tenacious bastard.
GID00086492	I've held off killing him as we don't have the resources right now, I want to concentrate on locating the vault and time is pressing. Besides, with all the casualties we have taken on the way here, it might be worth trying to recruit him. I could use a man like that.
GID00086493	Capt Kelly - Log Entry 07
GID00086494	Curiously we have had a couple of people disappear. They have most likely become victim of some defence system but we can't locate the bodies. Granted they were only Vipers, so its not a major issue, but we do only have a limited supply of them.
GID00086495	Trail Log 1 of 43: Jack - Day0
GID00086496	It’s called Zion man. 
GID00086497	Some pre-war national park, whatever that was, full of fresh water, all the food you can eat and only some dumb ass tribal's living there. And they will probably think we are gods when we turn up with energy weapons. All ours for the taking.
GID00086498	It's like this; the place is known about but only by some caravans and they kept the route pretty much to themselves. Thing is it goes over the mountains, which is a pretty rough track and it takes them fucking years to get there. But there is another way. We got ourselves a pre-war map that shows the road. 
GID00086499	Of course there is a down side. The road snakes off through a load of canyons and is prime bush-whacking territory, not to mention landslides, poisonous bugs and all the rest of that stuff but there is enough of us now to make this work, especially now we have the firepower after our last score.
GID00086500	And here is the cleaver bit. Once we clear the road in, we then invite every other schmuck from Vegas, but we set up a toll just before they get in there. They have to pay! And we just live off the land and watch the caps role in! We can't lose.
GID00086501	We are all meeting in that old Route 95 Gas Stop, north of here. Here's the location and the key.
GID00086502	Trail Log 2 of 43: Daniel - Day1
GID00086503	I'm sitting this one out. There are too many unknowns and lets face it, our crew isn't exactly a squad of Rangers. JD runs a tight ship and can be ruthless, but I'm not sure even he can pull this off.
GID00086504	I mean, what's he got? Sure, Pinky's on board, but he isn't getting any younger and I suppose Spencer has been around a bit and is OK.
GID00086505	Linda is a decent medic, if you can keep her out of her own drugs long enough and then you got Finger and Suzy, a couple of wide eyed ex-raiders, also too fond of their chem's.
GID00086506	Max who isn't too bright, but he's bright enough to let JD do the thinking and big enough so people leave him alone and Spider can be useful as well. He can talk his way into anything, although that brings its own problems as it tends to be other men's women.
GID00086507	Bernie and Jack are good in a fight, but you should never confuse anger with courage and I wouldn't trust 'em as far as could comfortably spit them.
GID00086508	Bethany's clever, good with tech but she has issues, that girl seems to hate everyone. Then at the other end of the scale there is Jason who is as thick as molerat shit and a bit casual with other peoples property.
GID00086509	Finally you got the Cope brothers who are pretty solid I guess, just a bit intense. And of course Wellington, our pack Brahmin, probably the most reliable of the lot.
GID00086510	The skills are there, the problem is getting them to pull in the same direction and I doubt even a hard ass like JD can get that to work on a long expedition.
GID00086511	Trail Log 3 of 43: Joseph - Day1
GID00086512	I detest it when people say we can't loose, its tempting fate.
GID00086513	The map seems genuine enough. Spider got it from a hobo in Westside for a bottle of rot gut, or so he says. This character said he knows the route well and even marked it for fellow hobo's somehow.
GID00086514	Normally I would just laugh, every wastelander has a treasure map but Pinky says he knows him. Said his name was Ezra, in his day a prospector and a good one too. Evidently he had some really big scores but then got a taste for Vegas and hence his new career path as a bum.
GID00086515	It can't be that simple though. Life just isn't like that.
GID00086516	Trail Log 4 of 43: Bernie - Day2
GID00086517	We're all in apart from Daniel. Says its fools gold. I think he has just gone soft in his old age, the old man would just slow us down anyway.
GID00086518	Keep your eye on Spider as well. He's been acting a little weird and I reckon he has an angle somewhere. I'm not worried as he's just a kid and if he pulls a fast one it will be his last, we just need to keep an eye on him, that's all.
GID00086519	Trail Log 5 of 43: JD - Day2
GID00086520	Jacks such an asshole. Does he honestly think we can just follow the map and take it all for ourselves? And set up a toll? Every fucker we come across will already be doing that. We are gonna have to fight and pay all the way to Zion.
GID00086521	But I've heard some good things about the place, unspoiled. And if the route is viable, well, that's information. And to people like the NCR and Crimson Caravan that's worth hard caps. Legion gold if it comes to that.
GID00086522	First stop is this place on the map called Hayford, I've heard there is a place to re-supply there.
GID00086523	Trail Log 6 of 43: Spencer - Day2
GID00086524	Spider sprung one on me today. Say's that hobo told him of a vault in the canyons. Says it still locked up tight. Came to me because I'm the vault expert and Bernie and Jack are dicks.
GID00086525	Makes sense I suppose, the entire population went underground during the war and there are vaults, shelters and holes everywhere.
GID00086526	Maybe I shouldn't mouthed off about vaults though. Sure I've been to Vault 34, didn't actually go in there, too much radiation. And I did go into Vault 22. Just. Well I looked inside. I thought the sign was just to put people off, but that place was too freaky.
GID00086527	I have been into Vault 19 to make a trade with some Powder Gangers, but I'll be damned if I was going to stick around to look about. Ironically, I then spent half of the caps in the only other vault I've been in, Vault 21. Not sure if that counts.
GID00086528	The hobo was probably just playing with the kid but then Spider does have a way with people. He's a silver tongued fucker, I've known him to get inside a women's pants in less than 10 minutes. 
GID00086529	But a real deal un-opened Vault? They were meant to keep out nukes, how the hell are we going to get in? But what if we could? And who or what is inside?
GID00086530	Trail Log 7 of 43: Jason - Day3
GID00086531	They are laughing at me for paying for the hobo's stash. They think I've been taken, but the hobo swears it’s where he left an emergency stockpile that he has never been able to get back to. I have a good feeling about it, my lucks gotta turn after Vegas, I'm due. It’s buried in the grave of some one called Count Abraham Jefferson III. I thought we killed him at Goodsprings? That’s gotta be a sign. It’s the big one, I just know it. They won't be laughing then.
GID00086532	Trail Log 8 of 43: JD - Day3
GID00086533	It all went to shit today. That didn't take long.
GID00086534	Bernie & Jack said Spider fell and was killed by that waterfall, reckon he was trying to climb down to get some water. Some of the others are not buying into it, and to be honest neither am I. There has been bad blood between them ever since Spider fucked that piece of tail Bernie had his eye on in Primm.
GID00086535	We checked but Spider was gone, no sign of him. I really don't need this shit right now, it’s going to be a long journey and I really need everyone on board.
GID00086536	Spencer was really mad, I didn't realise him and Spider were so tight. I cooled it down, but it’s not over. We will camp here tonight, we can hunt some Mantis's and Spencer wants to do another search for spider, which is worth a shot I suppose.
GID00086537	Trail Log 9 of 43: Spider - Day3
GID00086538	Jesus, my head hurts. Not sure what the fuck hit me, I think it was one of those two asshole's, Jack or Bernie, probably Bernie. Didn't think they would actually try to kill me though.
GID00086539	I was just looking at that waterfall when the next thing I knew I was in the water trying not to drown. I managed to clamber onto a rock, I think they were still up there but I wasn't going to show myself or they would have finished me with a bullet. They soon went away as they probably thought I had drowned. Bernie thinks I can't swim cause I wouldn't go for a dip in Lake Mead when he did. I didn't bother telling him it was because of the Lakelurks.
GID00086540	Couldn't get back up the cliff to the others so I floated down steam until I found somewhere where I could pull myself out. There is a bridge up ahead, I'll get to there and work out what to do tomorrow, but I need rest first and sort out what kit I have. I've lost my rifle, but I think I can salvage my stealth boys.
GID00086541	Trail Log 10 of 43: Suzy - Day4
GID00086542	The fucking Spider thing blew up again this morning. It was gonna to happen.
GID00086543	After a lot of shouting and bullshit threats Jack and Bernie gave JD a mouthful and took off, said they knew a shorter route than the one we were following and would see us there, and get this; as long as we had the caps to pay their toll! Asshole's!
GID00086544	I thought for a moment JD was frag the pair of them, then Pinky said something to him and he just let them go. What the fuck is Pinky seeing that we're not? ah fuck it, I don't care and I seriously doubt we will be paying any fucking toll to Jack and Bernie.
GID00086545	Trail Log 11 of 43: Nathan - Day4
GID00086546	Spencer finally come clean about what Spider and him were up to.
GID00086547	They believed they knew the whereabouts of an unopened vault and were considering about taking it on themselves, but Spencer has come to his senses. Just as well as JD already seemed to know about it, or at least know that Spencer knew about it. The fools should know better to keep such information to themselves and besides, not much stays secret around here.
GID00086548	Seems Zion is postponed for the moment.
GID00086549	Trail Log 12 of 43: Bernie - Day4
GID00086550	Fuck those losers, we'll get to Zion before them anyway. Jack reckons this route by-passes a whole load of shit. I can trust Jack, not those other fucker's.
GID00086551	I don't know why they were all whinging about Spider anyway. That was so funny, Jack is still laughing about it. He dared me to do him, so I did. Rifle butted him so hard he never made a sound, then just chucked his sorry ass over the cliff. I was aiming for the rocks, but I think he went into the water. Doesn't matter, the dick couldn't swim anyway.
GID00086552	As for the rest fuck 'em all. JD comes across all mean and nasty but I could take him down if I wanted, he don't frighten me. As for that smart ass Pinky he makes me want to puke. Thinks he knows everything, well, you didn't know about this route did you asshole.
GID00086553	Trail Log 13 of 43: Max - Day5
GID00086554	I'm surprised we got passed those raiders without a shot fired. It was a stroke of luck that Finger and Suzy knew one of them and organized passage and smart of JD to go through at dawn rather than the arranged time. By the time those doped up idiots had got themselves together we were already marching through and the look on that bitch in charge when JD thanked her for letting us through was priceless. There was fuck all she could do about us and she knew it, especially as JD was cradling 'Diplomacy' at the time. He dropped her some caps anyway. To oil the wheels and help her save face, in case we come back this way, he said.
GID00086555	I'm not saying they would have bushwhacked us as we went through but judging by all the crap lying around we wouldn't have been the first. Not sure if Finger or Suzy was in on it or not, JD sure 'kept them close.
GID00086556	Trail Log 14 of 43: Pinky - Day5
GID00086557	I thought Ezra had lost it when I saw him in Westside. But he managed to sell us a skanky old map, Spider a Vault and Jason a Treasure stash. You have to credit the old bastard, he's still got the touch when he's sober.
GID00086558	I wonder which of these are actually the real thing? I grilled him on it, as I did him some favours in the past.
GID00086559	I'll buy into the map, but he said to forget the vault. Why sell it to spider and then tell me that? The best lies always have a veneer of truth but he seemed strangely reluctant to go into details.
GID00086560	I seriously doubt we are the first he has sold this too as well.
GID00086561	Trail Log 15 of 43: Spider - Day5
GID00086562	What a night that was. I got up on the bridge and headed east. I ended up at some weird industrial place that was full of Super Mutants! If I hadn't salvaged those stealth boys I would have been fucked. I didn't stop, I kept on through the night as I need to catch up with the rest, but Jesus, what a journey. 
GID00086563	I managed to get out in the morning and not a moment too soon. I heard screaming coming back from the quarry, sounds like they have caught someone. I wasn't going to hang around so I pushed on through the next tunnel and ended up staring at a fucking Robot on the other side. Just as well I still had my copy of the map, it had the override code written on it. Boy, did I need that one.
GID00086564	I had a quick look at the road and it’s blocked, so I guess it’s another tunnel but I'm too strung out to carry on. I found this camp and crashed, my new robot friend can stand sentry for me.
GID00086565	Trail Log 16 of 43: Jack - Day6
GID00086566	I gotta get out of here. Leave Bernie, he's fucked.
GID00086567	One of those green freaks told him to shut up so he gave it the finger and shouted 'eat me'. That's a really stupid thing to say to a super mutant. He was lucky that thing wasn't hungry and only took his arm for a snack.
GID00086568	I wish he would shut the fuck up and stop whining, he's got another one. Don't think he is going last much longer anyway, the mutant used a chainsaw and it made a hell of a mess. Don't think it was very sharp.
GID00086569	I need to get myself out and he would only slow me down. It was his fault we are in this mess anyway, he's the one who whacked Spider and through him off a cliff.
GID00086570	Need to get back to the others, tell them about Bernie, they will let me back. If I can just get out of here, I can work out where they are. Wait, that's an idea, maybe I can trade them in, tell the mutants where they are in exchange for them letting me go. That's a plan.
GID00086571	I think one is coming back, OK, let’s put this plan to work.
GID00086572	Trail Log 18 of 43: Linda - Day6
GID00086573	I think I'm really losing it, I've used my last jet, and I have to get another fix. 
GID00086574	I pulled sentry last night and I always hate that. Left me sat on a bar stool looking back the way we came, with one of the Cope's, Joseph I think, guarding the other way. Those two worry me. I'm no shrink, but they are far too tightly wrapped. 
GID00086575	It was the early hours and I was singing to myself to keep awake. Fall asleep on sentry and JD would freak and he has a real nasty side to him. I always hear things in the dark anyway, but I swear I heard Spider calling to me. I'm not sure if I was asleep and dreaming or it was the drugs, or lack off, but I just ran back to the diner and kept watch from there. 
GID00086576	Only Beth saw me. She gave me a nasty look but she won't mention it. She understands, she knows what I'm going through.
GID00086577	I shouldn't have come, I should have stayed with Daniel, I really feel strung out. I'll have a word with JD, we have stuff that will put me just right.
GID00086578	Trail Log 19 of 43: Spider - Day6
GID00086579	I'm finished.
GID00086580	Didn't know this place was full of ghouls until it was too late. Tried to sneak through but my last stealth boy gave up on me just when I needed it. I managed to escape them up here, but they can sense I'm still around, I can hear them looking.
GID00086581	I've tried to reach that grill to get out, but I just can't. There is something on it and I can't move it and I'm screwed. Ironic, I've screwed so many I guess it’s my turn! Shit, shit, shit.
GID00086582	Are they in the corridor below?
GID00086583	I took a hit from one of them, a dose of radiation as well and I have no chem's so I'm starting to fade fast. My mind is starting to wander, I actually thought I heard Linda singing a moment ago. I even called out. The only thing that attracted was the ghouls.
GID00086584	I can hear them below. Fuck. I've got 5 rounds left. That's four of them I can take with me. Fuck.
GID00086585	Never could get near Bethany. What was her problem?
GID00086586	I think they are on the stairs.
GID00086587	How the fuck did I end up here? It’s not fair, I never meant to hurt people, I was just having fun. Wasn't my fault that hooker believed me when I said I would get her out, I just didn't have the money to pay her. Not my fault they caught her with her bags packed...
GID00086588	They are at the top. I can see one.
GID00086589	Trail Log 20 of 43: JD - Day7
GID00086590	Lost Suzy today. Sniper got her. No one saw it coming and she certainly didn't. She was probably stoned again, wandering off down the road like that. 
GID00086591	Joseph took down the Sniper as it didn't take him long to work out where he was, Joe's good like that. Not sure how the fucker got up there, Spencer wanted to go a loot the body but I told him to leave it, I don't want to waste time wandering around the mountains as there may be more of them and this is their turf.
GID00086592	It finished Finger, Suzy was the only real reason he was here. He just turned around and headed back, probably to those raiders at the bridge. I think he was still stewing about that incident, the fact I kept him in the dark about the move.
GID00086593	I let him go, I've had enough of Junkies today. Linda's becoming a problem again, although I'll stick with her because she's useful. Finger would become a liability.
GID00086594	Trail Log 21 of 43: Jason - Day7
GID00086595	Bastards, they think it’s so funny. 10 caps, some mouldy food and a single energy cell. I'm going to kill that fucking hobo.
GID00086596	Trail Log 22 of 43: Linda - Day7
GID00086597	We have lost another. Nathan was killed when we clashed with some Viper gang as we were looking for the Vault, the two groups practically walked into each other.
GID00086598	It was pretty bloody and one sided as I think only one of them escaped but Nathan just got unlucky, it was just a single stray round. No one is even sure who fired it.
GID00086599	Oh shit, I think it was me. It was all so chaotic and quick and I have this really horrible feeling it could have come from me accidentally. I don't know, nothings been said but there was nothing I could do for him, it was instant. The wound looks like a 10mm, that's what I carry.
GID00086600	Joseph took his body back to the church, says he needs to take care of him. Something about consecrated ground, a religious thing I think. No one tried to stop him. 
GID00086601	I really need another fix.
GID00086602	Trail Log 23 of 43: Joseph - Day8
GID00086603	It’s just you and me now Nathan. The others have left and it doesn't surprise me. They don't understand. I told mother I would look after you and that's what I'm going to do. We are going to be fine, I'm not going to let anyone come near us, we are going to be OK.
GID00086604	Trail Log 24 of 43: Max - Day8
GID00086605	We have had a quick scout around, there is a lot here still locked up. Was going to try and get in but JD said to hold off. Not sure why, but you don't argue with JD.
GID00086606	Beth managed to hack into the only working terminal. Couldn't get much out of it but it seems the security systems are still online and there is an awful lot of it just for a fucking train yard. Guess JD was right. 
GID00086607	I think the plan is too find a master terminal or a power source or something so we can shut the whole thing down.
GID00086608	Trail Log 25 of 43: JD - Day9
GID00086609	Damn Pinky, he really pisses me off sometimes.
GID00086610	We found the Vault entrance! Vault 616. Still locked up tight. Result, now we just have to work out a way in. Yes that will be a tough one, a really tough one but the rewards could be huge. Then Pinky sticks his oar in.
GID00086611	He says leave it. Nothing good ever happened in a vault. Bad karma, conspiracy theory shit. Didn't give any specifics, rumour's, stuff he has heard, fucking etc, etc...  And what did him mean about writing on the wall?
GID00086612	He's done this before.
GID00086613	And what sticks in my craw, what really fucking gets to me.... is that the old bastard is always right.
GID00086614	Trail Log 26 of 43: Beth - Day9
GID00086615	Well that's really screwed it all up. JD decided to pull the plug and leave the vault and go for Zion. Says the risks are too great.
GID00086616	Spencer lost it. Says he is crazy, it’s the opportunity of a lifetime. And more importantly he is not giving up, he is staying with the vault and doesn't care what everyone else does.
GID00086617	All of us except Jason sided with JD, we have come this far and he has never let us down but even I am questioning this one. True, the security systems are still up and running and I haven't been able to get into them. But I'm sure some of the access gates can be opened, I just need to locate the electrical trip reset.
GID00086618	From what I've seen the Vault is still probably functional and might even be occupied. Could we not even try? JD says no, we are moving out. I'm taking some of the computer files with me anyway, maybe I can make sense of them later.
GID00086619	That's another two down, less than half of us left, the crew is breaking up.
GID00086620	Trail Log 27 of 43: Finger - Day10
GID00086621	I'm back where I belong.
GID00086622	I was surprised to see Ris in this shit hole though, last time I saw her was in Vault 3. Maybe she pissed off Motor-Runner once too often. Anyway, she says I'm cool so the others have accepted me as they don't fuck with Ris.
GID00086623	I had enough of those other asshole's anyway and JD never trusted me. Screw 'em.
GID00086624	Trail Log 28 of 43: Linda - Day10
GID00086625	We talked to Joseph on the way out and he is staying is staying at the church. Those two were always strange but loosing Nathan has pushed Joe over the edge, he has really lost it. He was quite aggressive with us.
GID00086626	Then again, maybe he knows.
GID00086627	Trail Log 29 of 43: Jason - Day10
GID00086628	It seems we have been wondering around these tunnels for ages. We found this derelict service place and are camping here. We are not the first, someone has been here before us, nice of them to leave us this stuff. Talking of which I sold my re-breather in Vegas and need another, I’ll borrow Spencer’s. He is out trying to find a way through these tunnels at the moment. He has a stealth boy as well, I’ll borrow that too, I’m sure he won’t mind.
GID00086629	Trail Log 30 of 43: Spencer - Day11
GID00086630	I think Jason must be dead. On the way in through those damn tunnels one of the grills gave way and down he went. I managed to hang on to one of the pipes but Jason disappeared. I shouted down but could hear nothing.
GID00086631	I thought we were screwed when I came across that first service shaft, we were just lucky whoever was here before us left us a ladder which I managed to bridge the gap with. Jason asked what happened to him so I told him he had probably given up, which he seemed happy with. I really envied Jason sometimes, ignorance can be such a happy place. I reckon whoever it was is actually at the bottom of that shaft and now Jason is at the bottom of another. It’s true what they say. Gravity really does suck.
GID00086632	I’ll rest a while, then move on. And where the fuck is my re-breather? I might need that.
GID00086633	Trail Log 31 of 43: Spencer - Day12
GID00086634	I exited out of some service hatch and into the vault and it was all there and functioning! I told them! A fully functioning vault! I checked the first rooms I came to, one was locked and the other, well, I can only assume raiders got here first. Fuck. It actually looked all a bit clinical for raiders but what other sick fuck would do this?
GID00086635	I managed to find my way up to this storage area, which wasn’t easy as I must have lost my spare stealth boy down that shaft but then I came across those damn robots. I wasn’t expecting them as I didn’t think raiders used them but they got me. I managed to escape but I haven’t got long, it doesn’t hurt but I’m going cold. I guess JD was right about this place, but it must have been worth a shot. 
GID00086636	It’s a fully functioning vault and I got inside, yeah, that’s me, the vault expert. Guys, you should have trusted me. Together this would have worked.
GID00086637	Trail Log 33 of 43: Linda - Day13
GID00086638	I'm still feeling rough, I've had a word with that trader to get me some stuff. He was a bit reluctant at first but I hit him with a load of medical jargon and won him around.
GID00086639	He was probably wondering why I didn't go to the Followers Doctor, but Louise would probably recognize me and I couldn't deal with that. 
GID00086640	The others seem happy enough but I'm sure they are talking about me and the shooting back at the train yard. Deciding what to do.
GID00086641	Trail Log 34 of 43: Beth - Day14
GID00086642	We walked into ‘Rita’s Cafe’ 2 days ago and it's been a welcome break. A chance to rest, trade and re-supply.
GID00086643	From talking to the locals we are not that far off from Zion Park now, although it doesn’t promise to be an easy journey. We have all talked about it and have decided to carry on, even though this 'unknown' road has turned out to be anything but. Everyone was in favour apart from Linda who doesn’t seem to care one way or the other. She has been very quiet just recently.
GID00086644	We also asked about the Vault but nobody seems to know anything. JD reckons they are lying and actually know a whole lot about it, but for some reason don’t want admit it. I wonder how Spencer and Jason are doing?
GID00086645	Talking of which, I've finally made some head way with one of those deleted computer files I dug out at the train yard. Its taken me a while because I assumed they were Vault related, but they were not. So what is Stone Case?  
GID00086646	We were planning to set out this morning, but we are running late so I’m not sure how far we will get today.
GID00086647	Trail Log 35 of 43: Pinky - Day15
GID00086648	Linda died today. She had disappeared during the night and we found her this morning.
GID00086649	There were no wounds but she was lying face down in a pool of her own puke, surrounded by empty jet inhalers so it’s a fair bet it was drug related.
GID00086650	Either an overdose or a bad chem batch, I'm not sure which. She must have got them from Rita’s Cafe as JD has been keeping the heavy duty stuff himself.
GID00086651	This has hit us hard. Linda was popular when she was clean and a good medic, I guess she just had too many demons, but I really never thought she was this far gone. We should never have brought her.
GID00086652	And then there were four.
GID00086653	Trail Log 36 of 43: Max - Day15
GID00086654	So this is Zion? Made good time today despite some Cazadors. We decide to camp at this old ‘ranger’ station. Never heard of a park ranger before, I wonder if they were as mean as NCR rangers? We are going to head east down into the valley tomorrow.
GID00086655	Trail Log 38 of 43: Max - Day16
GID00086656	When we got down by the lake we realised there were some sort of tribal group there. I haven’t seen anything like them before and they look pretty primitive.
GID00086657	JD’s trying to talk to them, Seems they are going to lets us through.
GID00086658	Trail Log 39 of 43: Pinky - Day16
GID00086659	It all went to hell when we went to pass those tribal's, they tried to take us. It wasn't a total surprise, we were not that stupid, but they were everywhere. I reckon they must have been on to us before we camped yesterday.
GID00086660	One of them got lucky with a grenade, which went off amongst us, wounding all but me. JD then told me to get the others out while he held the fucker's off. You know, for all the years I've known John I never had him down as the hero type. 
GID00086661	I dragged them away until I realised we were in a dead end, so I left them there and went back, I should have stayed with John. I was too late to help him but he had gone down hard and I managed to finish off the rest. I might be an old bastard but I'm a mean old bastard. 
GID00086662	When I returned to the others Max was already dead and Beth was practically unconscious, concussion I think. I've buried John and Max, we need to rest, give Beth a chance to recover and let the med's to kick in.
GID00086663	- Fuck, there is more of them appearing, we need to move, quick. It’s still dark, maybe we can slip past, get back to Rita's Cafe
GID00086664	Trail Log 40 of 43: Pinky - Day17
GID00086665	They had got behind us and blocked off our way back to Rita’s cafй, Beth said to go this way but I'm not sure so I should have listened, I don't think she is really with it.
GID00086666	Now we are just running anywhere and we can't shake them off as we are hemmed in this bloody canyon. Almost out of ammo as well, so there is not much chance we can fight our way out of this. We just have to keep going.
GID00086667	Trail Log 41 of 43: Pinky - Day18
GID00086668	I’m exhausted and so is the ammo. Guess this is the end, we gave it a good shot. I think Beth is hallucinating, she keeps saying we made it, poor kid.
GID00086669	Trail Log 42 of 43: Beth - Day20
GID00086670	Pinky is still sleeping. The poor old bastard was all in, probably from dragging my sorry ass around.
GID00086671	My head is pounding and ears are still ringing a bit but we are safe now. Those tribal's following us tried to get in as well but its not a mistake they will make again. I hope those robots are programmed to clear up the mess. 
GID00086672	When I saw it, it was almost too much to hope for but there it was. We found Stone Case. My habit of collecting old computer files and passwords has often paid dividends but never before on this scale. This time it really was a life saver and we have literally struck gold to boot. 
GID00086673	It is a pity we cannot share it with JD and Max, and Linda but if they were still alive we would probably would never have ended up here in the first place. I wonder what happened to the others?
GID00086674	Fate has been whimsical this journey.
GID00086675	Trail Log 43 of 43: Note
GID00086676	To Whom it may concern
GID00086677	Sorry, we beat you to it. We have already taken most of what was in here and we have left this one gold bar as we couldn't carry any more. We considered coming back for it so we reset the security systems as you will have noticed.
GID00086678	But, if you have made it this far you probably deserve this and we won't hold it against you for taking whatever's left.
GID00086679	Enjoy - Beth & Pinky
GID00086680	Diary 01: Cpl Sherwood
GID00086681	March, 2078. We're here. Hoping to find food and supplies in this supply bunker we are here to empty. Maybe shelter as well, I'm sick of rad meds and my respirator is starting to pull the skin of my face. There are still radiation clouds everywhere but at least the black rain hasn't returned.
GID00086682	The captain isn't helping though, he has become a real martinet. He has already shot one man for insubordination and desertion is starting to become more common.
GID00086683	Diary 02: Cpl Sherwood
GID00086684	We have hit problem as we can't get in, sounds like we don't have the access codes for some reason. The captain in desperation just decided to blast his way in the first entrance he came to and only managed to bring down the tunnel. Now we are seriously fucked. We located a service entrance, tried the same thing and almost achieved the same results. Now we can't force that either without collapsing it. It would be funny, but he is now panicking and taking it out on us.
GID00086685	He finally listened to one of the sappers who suggested we could dig our way in. We have blasted as much as we dare and are now going at it with whatever tools we have, but the guys are really keen as there maybe some decent food and shelter for us at the end of it.
GID00086686	Diary 03: Cpl Sherwood
GID00086687	Well, we made it, but its not all we hoped for. The vault was obviously subject to some cutbacks. Its letting in water, the air is fetid and the reactor is leaking.
GID00086688	There are supplies here, but the captain has managed to bring a train up and is shipping the stuff straight out. I'm sure him and his little inner circle are helping themselves to it, but most of us are getting nothing. The rest of us are exhausted as we are having to hump everything by hand through the hole we dug to get in.
GID00086689	Diary 04: Cpl Sherwood
GID00086690	I've found this working terminal but there are no records, I guess the main server is dead. I told the Captain I'm still working on recovering data but I'm just using it to type up my diary. It beats humping stores around and I don't trust myself to leave the food alone. I am so hungry.
GID00086691	Diary 05: Cpl Sherwood
GID00086692	One of the train carriages broke down. Its been repaired by scavenging parts from the rearmost carriage which is being abandoned. We are taking the remaining supplies by road in what vehicles we have. Two guys from the 2nd company took some of the food as they were shifting it, then the captain found out and had them shot out of hand.
GID00086693	2103 Andrew Poke diary
GID00086694	We have finally got to Ground House and it is not good. The whole thing looks like its collapsed. More specifically it looks like the place has been blown up, god knows why.
GID00086695	So what now? we are sheltering in the tunnel, it still seems to be solid enough around the entrance. At least we have water here and there enough wildlife around here to hunt.
GID00086696	Some of the group want to head south to Vegas, but I'm not buying it. I think we should stay away from any large centers of population.
GID00086697	2104 Andrew Poke diary
GID00086698	Some people have headed south while the rest of us are still hanging on here, its not been easy but we are surviving. We have had help from some outsiders joining us, the stories they have been sharing do not paint a nice picture of the world.
GID00086699	We still haven't given up on the storage vault, we cleared some of the rubble away from a building on top of the tunnel to find an entrance and we managed to break into what I think is part of the tunnel maintenance system. Typically they lead to the same place. We came to stop at a security door, it looks like someone has been here before us and tried to blow it which has ruled out that option for us. The whole thing could come down. Still, at least we don't actually need it now. We are surviving without it.
GID00086700	2104 Andrew Poke diary
GID00086701	Heard from Charlie, he tried Vegas but I don't think it was much good and it sounds like he has settled at a place further south of here. Good to hear from the old buzzard.
GID00086702	2114 Andrew Poke diary
GID00086703	My wife has been nagging me to stay out of that tunnel again. I think everyone has forgotten why we originally came here but I've never lost my curiosity about that storage vault, what was it called? Ground House?
GID00086704	I managed to pull out some wiring at that security door and have been trying to hook up a computer to it. There is still some sort of network there I think, but I'll be damned if I can hack into it. I'm sure we brought the access code with us, was it David that had it? He never came back from Vegas.
GID00086705	My son sits and watches me, maybe he will have better luck some day. Truth be known we still don't know if there is anything behind that door. Maybe my wife is right, I should give it up, I'm too old for this now.
GID00086706	2117 Andrew Poke diary
GID00086707	Vault 616 was due to open this year, but nothing has been seen. Every now and then we get a story of folks disappearing around the train yard, but we stay away. It's kind of achieved bogey man status now. Locals here know but no one says anything. Its as if you don't speak of it, its not real.
GID00086708	Someday the outside world will find it, then there will be a reckoning.
GID00086709	Note
GID00086710	Do not activate this robot. Its behaving very strangely.
GID00086711	Scheduled for serving as soon as there is a pad available.

GID00086714	You Idiot Alan, I told you not to take too much. I liked that kid, he was one of my favourite blood groups and we could have strung him out for ages.
GID00086715	Anyway, see if you can find the kids name, it was Jason I think, you know the Chef likes to give his dishes a name but tell him no curry this time. I want to be able to taste this one 'cause 'Melvin Madras' burnt my ass off. And see if there is any Chianti left.

GID00086735	Received - Blu Ray
GID00086736	Hey Blinder you idiot
GID00086737	Do you remember the name 'Burgess'. Didn't you get that name out of one of those clowns who then disappeared down that tunnel of yours a few years back. Well guess who has turned up and camped out in the old house at the top of Hayford. A Ghoul, nasty piece of work and asking a lot of questions.
GID00086738	Sent - Blu Ray
GID00086739	Yeah I remember.
GID00086740	Well don't just sit there with your thumb up your ass, find out what his game is. Give his drum a spin if you have to, but don't use Emma, she's a good girl. Find a passing wastelander, preferably one with an IQ at least into double figures (which of course rules you out).

GID00086742	Of course I won't use Emma you cretin. And keep your eye out for a group of mercs under NCR command. Not sure what they are up to, but they are bad news.
GID00086743	And have you sorted out your Lurk farm yet or are they still getting eaten by the fruit plants! That's so funny, but if you do get it sorted send some of the Lurk meat down with Angel

GID00086745	Hey Fuckstick, 
GID00086746	I've got some news on Burgess. I got this ugly looking prospector to go through his place. It seems he is interested in Ground House and I reckon this prospector has some more info on it. I've gave your name and told them to look you up. Be careful, this one has an arsenal and isn't shy about using it.
GID00086747	oh and that NCR outfit, seems they are looking for freak central. That's going to get messy.
GID00086748	Reminder
GID00086749	Need to finish that ammo consignment, Angel is bound to be back through sometime soon and will be expecting it.
GID00086750	I'll get on to Emma about it, that daughter of mine needs to pull her head out of the clouds and get some work done, too dreamy and idealistic, just like her mother. But that's the Poke family for you.
GID00086751	Hotel Log 1
GID00086752	A group of mercs come prospectors turned up today. We did some trading and they crashed at the hotel overnight, I think they are heading to Zion for some reason although they were pretty tight lipped about it. From what I gather there has been some falling out within the group as well, maybe there are some more of them around, I'll keep my eye out.
GID00086753	Hotel Log 2
GID00086754	Another big group came in today. Not sure what their story is, seems to be an NCR operation but most of the foot soldiers were Vipers or some other gang. They haven't been too much trouble, other than the usual, but it's a strange combination. They were not too subtle about Ris and her toll bridge either, I think she just legged it after a brief fire fight. That may cause problems later on if and when she returns. 
GID00086755	Didn't like the look of this group though, may have to send word and warn that idiot brother-in-law of mine.
GID00086756	Burgess
GID00086757	I need to get to the bottom of this guys story. He has been here about a month now, but he is not the settling down type of person.
GID00086758	He is a mean and nasty piece of work, which has been useful dealing with our local raider problems, but he has been snooping around everywhere and asking an awful lot of questions.
GID00086759	He has an angle somewhere and I need to find out what it is.
GID00086760	Weirdo Report
GID00086761	I don't believe that weirdo Frobisher disappeared with some hooker the other day. I didn't think he had it in him.
GID00086762	He is a freaky guy but has been a really good customer for junk. He must have a place up the river somewhere, north of here I'm guessing.

GID00086765	I've 'confined' Dr Nice to his office, it didn't seem right to put in one of the cages as we have done with the others in the past.
GID00086766	We may be able to do something in the future for him but these compounds we are dealing with are just so complex.
GID00086767	We can only carry on with his work and hope we find a solution, but since he was the mind behind all this, his condition is a real setback for us. Dr Nice thought he had this under control but we must of missed something. We will do what we can.

GID00086770	Diary 06: Cpl Sherwood
GID00086771	We have had enough. They were making some of the guys move the barrels of radioactive waste outside into the collapsed chamber. We rounded the captain and all his cronies up and locked them all in the reactor room, so they can see what it feels like. 
GID00086772	They will get out soon enough but the radiation will kill them before long and even if it doesn't we are going to bring the rest of this tunnel down to seal them in.
GID00086773	We have eaten what we wanted and are taking the remaining supplies for ourselves. We are going to head back to try and find our families. Screw the military, screw the government. There is nothing left to fight for, no country left to serve. Its all gone to hell and they sent it there.
GID00086774	Research Memo
GID00086775	Chief
GID00086776	Thank you for your concern regarding the UV lighting used to maintain the flora. I am well aware of the harmful effects photophobia can have on our residents but you must understand that these plants form an important function in our air filtration system and if we switch the lights off permanently they will die.
GID00086777	We can shut the atrium off for periods when the lights are on and suitable eye protection can be worn by anyone who has to go in there. You already have the modified issue security helmets used for external patrols & snatch squads.

GID00086780	PS If you handle the current 'visitors' correctly we will have enough livestock so we won't have to venture outside, for a while at least.

GID00086782	Geoff, I've told you before, I will not generate a timesheet code for robot servicing, its not needed.
GID00086783	Saved Email02
GID00086784	Geoff, stop moaning and get on with it. I see your timesheets every week and I know you have not spent more time on robot servicing than you have on rail maintenance work. They are not a waste of time as our projections indicate they will increase efficiency by 34.7%.
GID00086785	And stop picking on Des. And stop hiding his lucky Dino toy, I really don't have time for this nonsense.
GID00086786	Saved Email03
GID00086787	And talking of timesheets, you’re late again. You know that timesheets have to be submitted by the end of the week, sort it out. And don't you dare do any in more than a week in advance.

GID00086799	Cracked it! Stone Case, Access code: DH65-HJ2976. Almost there with the security code.
GID00086800	I think its a pre-war facility of sorts, but there's only a place name which I don't recognise. There's no coordinate data.
