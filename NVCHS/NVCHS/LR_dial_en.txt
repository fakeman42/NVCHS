AAD00100002	Not now. Let's settle things here.
AAD00100003	If we're done here, let's leave the Divide behind. If we get separated, I'll meet you above Hopeville, near the Canyon Wreckage.

AAD00100186	The Divide couldn't stop me, the Mojave couldn't kill me - you don't have much chance.
AAD00100187	I'll finish history's work. If the Divide couldn't kill you... perhaps these spears of the Old World can.
AAD00100188	Let's end this, Courier, you and I. Here, with the Old World flag as witness.
AAD00100189	NVDLC04UlyssesForceGreet
AAD00100190	Even in this place, NCR's shadow falls. Or is it just, you, Courier, without the Bear's corpse to weigh you down.
AAD00100191	So you came, Frumentarii, Courier - whatever you are now. Come to carry out Caesar's law? His voice carries no weight here.
AAD00100192	Your city, Vegas, lies in the other direction... with the rest of its slaves. Or is it just, you, Courier, without the lights and ghosts.
AAD00100193	So you came, Courier, to what - watch your homeland burn one last time. Kill me, perhaps.
AAD00100194	Judging by your shadow... maybe you can't let your machine go. Doesn't matter now.
AAD00100195	Either way, the Divide giants are awakening. The missiles here, on their way home. There is no way to stop them.
AAD00100196	You are too late. The Divide is awakening - the package, and the message within, have come full circle.
AAD00100197	The sequence has begun, just as before. Except this time, the missiles will touch the sky instead of being locked beneath the ground.
AAD00100198	
AAD00100199	Thought that explosion, that building falling deep in the Divide might have been your work... wouldn't kill you, maybe close.
AAD00100200	Knew you'd survive... but no need to go any farther. You've brought me what I need - that machine with you, sealed in the Hopeville silo.
AAD00100201	Needed someone to unlock it - bring it home. Now the signal's strong enough, no need for you to carry it anymore. I can call your machine to me.
AAD00100202	
AAD00100203	Hopeville, High Road, Ashton... tiny cracks in the Earth, nothing compared to the road carved ahead.
AAD00100204	Before you... this is the edge of the Divide. Ahead lies your work, the history you burned in the earth. What you brought to the people here.
AAD00100205	
AAD00100206	There you are, you went quiet for a time... knew killing the Bear wouldn't prove easy... you and your machine, you survived.
AAD00100207	There's a lesson here, in the Divide. Old World history about paving and intentions could teach the Republic a thing or two - if they listened.
AAD00100208	They have an idea of trying to do what's right, never quite getting there. Maybe you've seen it - Nipton, elsewhere.
AAD00100209	Picking up the signal from your machine... was quiet for a time, thought the Road had claimed another of the Legion.
AAD00100210	Too many of the Bull have already fallen here... to radiation, fire... and what burrows below.
AAD00100211	There you are, you went quiet for a time... thought you might have returned to Vegas, its comforts. Maybe you took that machine with you.
AAD00100212	There's a lesson here, in the Divide. Old World history about holding on to something so tightly it breaks... or falls apart.
AAD00100213	May have seen the cracks in Vegas's walls already. If so, they'll grow, in time, no matter how much you back House.
AAD00100214	There you are, you went quiet for a time. Then that signal came in strong from your machine, like a heartbeat.
AAD00100215	Made your way through Old World towns, the tunnels that join them... now, the High Road.
AAD00100216	For all you've seen behind you - there's worse along this stretch. Deathclaws - hunt the Marked Men, and they also hunt what burrows below.
AAD00100217	< Storage Node for Skill Checks. Do not Translate. > 
AAD00100218	
AAD00100219	There's your signal... faint, but there. Just like NCR - voice without fire, without strength, sick.
AAD00100220	Heard tales of you walking the Mojave. Giving the two-headed bear strength. Giving hollow men like Kimball, like Crocker, half the life Hanlon had.
AAD00100221	Now... let's test that strength. That... "conviction." Courier.
AAD00100222	There's your signal... faint, but there. A woman in Caesar's service. Looks like the Bear has had its victory, after all.
AAD00100223	There's your signal... faint, but there. Charging ahead, like the rest of our brothers, blood in your eyes.
AAD00100224	Taking your chances, coming here. Just like bringing the lord of Vegas his tribute, bending your knee to Old World ghosts.
AAD00100225	You and that Chip - deserve each other, twenty-nine less coins than other traitors have carried, if history's true.
AAD00100226	Now see the road the Old World paves... and what the lights of New Vegas promise, if they haven't blinded your eyes.
AAD00100227	There's your signal. Faint, but there. You came, good. Curious, maybe.
AAD00100228	You walked the Mojave without a flag on your back. That'll end soon, can't walk the Long 15 and not have a nation's shadow fall on you.
AAD00100229	Maybe you just need to be tested. Or you believe in nothing. We'll see.

AAD00100233	Experiment log 369248/A - Eyebot Duraframe universal interface override system. This is Dr. Whitley presiding.
AAD00100234	Initial tests of the override system are promising. Against unsecured or lightly-encrypted targets, the Eyebots have a 98% success rate.
AAD00100235	More heavily protected systems are still problematic. Military-grade encryption presents a very real possibility of critical overload of key systems.
AAD00100236	We've stopped tests before any robots were destroyed, but if we don't address the problem our Eyebots will fry themselves hacking military networks.

AAD00100248	Good, you're back on-line. Listen to me, ED-E - if you stay here, they'll dismantle you for parts. You have to go now.
AAD00100249	I've uploaded destination coordinates for our outpost in Navarro into your system. I want you to go to the Enclave there, okay?
AAD00100250	Do you understand me? It's going to be a long journey, my little friend. You'll have to fly very far, and fly very fast. Can you do that?
AAD00100251	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100252	I know you can. Be careful out there, ED-E. Maybe I'll see you again some day.
AAD00100253	
AAD00100254	All due respect sir, I think you're making a mistake. We're close to a breakthrough with the Duraframe Eyebots, I can feel it! Yes, sir.
AAD00100255	Yes sir, I understand that we need the Duraframe assets for Hellfire armor, but-No, sir. Yes, sir. I understand, sir.
AAD00100256	I'll tell the team to start disassembling the ED series prototypes right away.
AAD00100257	ED-E, you little rascal. Were you eavesdropping again? I think those videos you watch are a bad influence on you. How much of that did you hear?
AAD00100258	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100259	Hmm... didn't Dr. Grant say she'd upgraded your navigational systems? I think I have an idea.... How'd you like to be just like RALPHIE?
AAD00100260	
AAD00100261	I don't believe it! Grant actually went to Colonel Autumn and got approval for her damned "efficiency guidelines!"
AAD00100262	"All experiments will be carried out with the test subject fully active, to reduce iteration time." It's barbaric!
AAD00100263	I've explained this to the Colonel - just because the Eyebots don't have true AI doesn't mean they're just machines.
AAD00100264	I guess results are all that matter around here. Forget things like "ethical procedures" or "humane treatment."
AAD00100265	I'm starting to have serious misgivings about leadership around here. At least I've got you to talk to, huh ED-E?
AAD00100266	
AAD00100267	Ah, Whitley, there you are. Orders from Colonel Autumn - he feels the Eyebot Duraframe project isn't advancing quickly enough. I'm to-
AAD00100268	Don't be ridiculous, it's just a machine. See here, I've already increased the navigation system's efficiency by 65%.
AAD00100269	Fine, Whitley, it's your lab. At least until I tell the Colonel about this.
AAD00100270	
AAD00100271	<Distressed beeping>
AAD00100272	Dr. Grant? What the hell do you think you're doing?
AAD00100273	You didn't even disengage his damage-avoidance protocols! You're hurting him!

AAD00100279	Yes! Success! Um, reporting full success on 369248/B. ED-E was able to interface with and override the test panel in under three seconds.

AAD00100301	Yes, I'm sure I heard it. Did something knock your memory modules loose?

AAD00100309	All right, boy. But if he breaks anything, it's coming out of your allowance!

AAD00100345	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100346	
AAD00100347	[SUCCEEDED] <Scared beeping>
AAD00100348	So you're trying to get all the way to Navarro? Isn't that in NCR territory?
AAD00100349	[FAILED] <Expository beeping>
AAD00100350	Oh... right. Navarro. That... sure is far? From where you started?
AAD00100351	I guess Whitley found a way to keep you from being scrapped. Let's keep going.
AAD00100352	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100353	Do you record everything that's said around you?
AAD00100354	<Sly beeping>
AAD00100355	Sounds like Dr. Whitley was a bit of a rogue element.
AAD00100356	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100357	Wow, do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
AAD00100358	<Embarassed beeping>
AAD00100359	You don't have to tell me. I would have beat the crap out of her.
AAD00100360	<Satisfied beeping>
AAD00100361	RALPHIE who? You're still not making sense, ED-E.
AAD00100362	<Evasive beeping>
AAD00100363	Who the hell is "General Winters?" The recording mentioned a Colonel Autumn.
AAD00100364	<Lonely beeping>
AAD00100365	That's a terrible story, ED-E, but we should get moving.
AAD00100366	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100367	Dr. Grant sounds like a war crime waiting to happen.
AAD00100368	<Angry beeping>
AAD00100369	It sounds like Dr. Whitley really cared about you.
AAD00100370	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100371	All right, let's keep moving.
AAD00100372	Maybe you'll see him again someday.
AAD00100373	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100374	Well, I'm sure he's fine. Wherever he is.
AAD00100375	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100376	Well, it might be enough to get us through this silo.
AAD00100377	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100378	Only panels with a dish-shaped receiver? The console in the main room had one of those, I think.
AAD00100379	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100380	That's fascinating. Let's keep going.
AAD00100381	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100382	Was that the voice of your creator? What happened to him?
AAD00100383	<Expository beeping>
AAD00100384	That's a recording from your development - are you saying you can override electronic security?
AAD00100385	<Expository beeping>
AAD00100386	I think I could use your help getting out of here. Can you come with me?
AAD00100387	ED-E? What are you doing here?
AAD00100388	<Expository beeping>
AAD00100389	<Expository beeping>
AAD00100390	What's an Eyebot doing here?
AAD00100391	
AAD00100392	[FAILED] <Worried beeping>
AAD00100393	It could be one of those robo-viruses. You might be contagious - stay away from other computers.
AAD00100394	[SUCCEEDED] <Happy beeping>
AAD00100395	Probably just some old data floating around in your memory. Nothing to worry about.
AAD00100396	I hope those bastards got what was coming to them.
AAD00100397	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100398	I can see why you left that place, then.
AAD00100399	<Wistful beeping>
AAD00100400	He must have tried to change things. He doesn't seem like the type to let that slide.
AAD00100401	<Wistful beeping>
AAD00100402	He sounds more like a father than an inventor in these logs.
AAD00100403	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100404	Let's press on. We've got a lot of ground to cover.
AAD00100405	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100406	I can't believe they'd approve that. I've met enough robots to know they're more than just machines.
AAD00100407	<Pained beeping>
AAD00100408	Whitley was really protective of his Eyebots, huh?
AAD00100409	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100410	Never mind.
AAD00100411	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100412	There are more robots like you? With the same memory and everything? Interesting....
AAD00100413	This silo must have some pretty advanced engineering facilities to remote-scan you and build copies.
AAD00100414	[SUCCEEDED] <Confirmatory beeping>
AAD00100415	[FAILED] <Negatory beeping>
AAD00100416	So you're some kind of... robot clone?
AAD00100417	You're a copy? Made by the military bases in the Divide? Weird.
AAD00100418	<Declarative beeping>
AAD00100419	Slow down, slow down - what do you mean you're not the ED-E I know?
AAD00100420	<Explanatory beeping>
AAD00100421	
AAD00100422	ED-E? What are you doing in here all alone? And who left these old videos playing? Come on, let's get you into your recharge bay.
AAD00100423	We've got a big day tomorrow.
AAD00100424	
AAD00100425	<Dramatic music>
AAD00100426	Forget it. The Legion has this coming.
AAD00100427	I don't care! I'll just change the missile's target myself. I never liked the NCR anyways.
AAD00100428	<Resigned beeping>
AAD00100429	If... if you're really sure you want this, okay. Go ahead and stop the missile. And... goodbye.
AAD00100430	<Determined beeping>
AAD00100431	Are you sure this is the only way to stop the missile from launching?
AAD00100432	<Confirmatory beeping>
AAD00100433	It looks like I can still choose the missile's actual target. Maybe we can work with that.
AAD00100434	<Negatory beeping>
AAD00100435	But the log said that this kind of encryption would kill you!
AAD00100436	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100437	What's a Chicago?
AAD00100438	<Expository beeping>
AAD00100439	Illinois? So that's where you got that plate. The other you, I mean.
AAD00100440	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100441	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100442	Illin-what? Come on, you're making that name up.
AAD00100443	Was it worth it? You still haven't made it to Navarro yet.
AAD00100444	<Determined beeping>
AAD00100445	You gave that up to continue Whitley's mission?
AAD00100446	<Proud beeping>
AAD00100447	
AAD00100448	[SUCCEEDED] <Happy beeping>
AAD00100449	Sounds like they blew out your primary stabilizing jets. I can't believe you kept going after that.
AAD00100450	[FAILED] <Sad beeping>
AAD00100451	That bullet probably did something bad.
AAD00100452	No wonder you didn't make it all the way to Navarro.
AAD00100453	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100454	You're lucky you got away from them. They would have sold you for scrap in a heartbeat.
AAD00100455	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100456	Raiders, huh? Amateurs. I'd have tracked you down and salvaged you for scrap.
AAD00100457	<Scared beeping>
AAD00100458	I bet Whitley would be proud of you for making it this far.
AAD00100459	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100460	It sounds like it wasn't easy for him, either.
AAD00100461	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100462	I'm amazed you didn't break down somewhere along the way.
AAD00100463	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100464	NVDLC04EndingSlideFinale
AAD00100465	And this road - has reached its end.
AAD00100466	NVDLC04EndingSlideStart
AAD00100467	The Couriers finally, really did it. They blew up the lands West and East of the Mojave... damning them all to hell.
AAD00100468	The act was discovered 200 years later, as other Couriers explored the Mojave wastes.
AAD00100469	There, they saw NCR relics, reminders of their once proud history.
AAD00100470	The Divide erupted in fire, violent, red, as the last message of the two Couriers arced into the sky...
AAD00100471	The missiles rained like spears down on the land, burning flags and communities alike... destroying all they struck.
AAD00100472	The history of the West was erased for the second time, thorough and complete... and America slept once more.
AAD00100473	The Divide erupted in fire as the flame trail of the two Couriers' last message arced into the sky...
AAD00100474	I'm running low on Small Energy Cells. Can you make me more?
AAD00100475	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100476	I need some Microfusion Cells. Can you make some?
AAD00100477	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100478	Can you repair my weapon?
AAD00100479	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100480	Let me access your multitools. I want to make something.
AAD00100481	<Confirmatory beeping>
AAD00100482	I'd like to make some ammo. Can you help me?
AAD00100483	<Confirmatory beeping>
AAD00100484	Sometimes I feel the same way. Why do you think I became a courier?
AAD00100485	<Melancholy beeping>
AAD00100486	Don't worry, I won't let any mean old generals get you.
AAD00100487	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100488	I'll do whatever I can to help you get home - after we deal with things here.
AAD00100489	<Hopeful beeping>
AAD00100490	Yes, ED-E, I'm sure RALPHIE the Robot would be very proud of you.
AAD00100491	<Ecstatic beeping>
AAD00100492	Come on, ED-E. We've got to fly far and fly fast if we want to get to the end of the Divide.
AAD00100493	<Determined beeping>
AAD00100494	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100495	Come on, ED-E. Time to move on.
AAD00100496	Is that what you're doing? Trying to find your way home?
AAD00100497	<Wistful beeping>
AAD00100498	Suddenly a lot of things make more sense.
AAD00100499	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100500	
AAD00100501	<Frightened beeping>
AAD00100502	
AAD00100503	RALPHIE, hurry! If mean old General Winters catches you, you'll never make it home! 
AAD00100504	No! RALPHIE, fly far! Fly fast! 
AAD00100505	But why would he do that? It wasn't to lure me here, Ulysses already knew I was coming.
AAD00100506	<Worried beeping>
AAD00100507	An override frequency? So, what, Ulysses just... called you here?
AAD00100508	<Confused beeping>
AAD00100509	Of course I came after you. I wasn't going to leave you behind.
AAD00100510	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100511	What happened? You just took off like you finally found home.
AAD00100512	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100513	Whatever he's planning, Ulysses obviously wants you there. Come on - I'd hate to disappoint him.
AAD00100514	You're at the mercy of your programming, I get it. It's not your fault. Now, are you ready to go?
AAD00100515	Okay, well, don't do it again. Come on, let's go.
AAD00100516	Come on. We're ending this. Right now.
AAD00100517	<Determined beeping>
AAD00100518	
AAD00100519	[SUCCEEDED] <Sad beeping>
AAD00100520	Must have been an override function piggybacked on that broadcast. That's what pulled you here.
AAD00100521	[FAILED] <Worried beeping>
AAD00100522	You just heard that signal and flew off. Are you catching the robot crazies or something?
AAD00100523	Are you okay?
AAD00100524	<Confirmatory beeping>
AAD00100525	What the hell happened? You just ran off on me.
AAD00100526	<Apologetic beeping>
AAD00100527	Play me the trailer for RALPHIE the Robot's Incredible Odyssey.
AAD00100528	I liked the one where the little kid found you.
AAD00100529	Let's hear the one where you were attacked by raiders.
AAD00100530	I want to hear the recording of when Whitley sent you on your journey.
AAD00100531	Play me Whitley's phone call with Colonel Autumn.
AAD00100532	Let's hear the log where Whitley talks about Colonel Autumn's plans.
AAD00100533	How about the one where Dr. Whitley yelled at Dr. Grant?
AAD00100534	Play the log about your ability to crack encrypted systems.
AAD00100535	I'd like you to replay one of those audio logs.
AAD00100536	<Inquisitive beeping>
AAD00100537	NVDLC04NCRHolotape03
AAD00100538	Mayday, mayday, mayday! This is NCR Trooper Gleeson calling anyone listening on this channel.
AAD00100539	My platoon has been wiped out, and I am pinned down by a goddamn huge Deathclaw in a place called the Divide!
AAD00100540	So far I've been able to scare it away with flares, but I lack any explosives to kill the damn thing! Please assist! I say again, please assist!
AAD00100541	Mayday, mayday, mayday! This is NCR Trooper Gleeson calling anyone listening on this channel.
AAD00100542	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatMarkedMenAllDead
AAD00100543	No more echoes of the Bull and the Bear. The rest will share their fate.
AAD00100544	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatEyebotsAllDestroyed
AAD00100545	Didn't think you'd outlast the machines. Good.
AAD00100546	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatMarkedMenEnter
AAD00100547	The dead men of the New World... they've come for you.
AAD00100548	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatEyebotsHostile01
AAD00100549	Took my machines? Hnh. Underestimated you.
AAD00100550	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatEyebotsDisabled01
AAD00100551	Just you and me, then. Always was.
AAD00100552	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatEyebotsHostile02
AAD00100553	Machines might keep you alive, but they won't save you.
AAD00100554	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatEyebotsDisabled02
AAD00100555	Can't stop the Old World's return, Courier.
AAD00100556	NVDLC04UlyssesFriendMarkedMenHalfDead
AAD00100557	We've shown them fear, but not enough. More will come.
AAD00100558	NVDLC04UlyssesFriendMMUsesStealthboy
AAD00100559	Watch the shadows - the beasts cloak themselves in Old World tech.
AAD00100560	NVDLC04UlyssesFriendMarkedMenAllDead
AAD00100561	We've broken them. The Bear and the Bull have no more shadows to throw at us.
AAD00100562	NVDLC04UlyssesFriendSentryDies02
AAD00100563	Old World's running out of machines.
AAD00100564	NVDLC04UlyssesFriendSentryDies01
AAD00100565	Another Old World soldier falls.
AAD00100566	NVDLC04UlyssesFriendTaunt03
AAD00100567	You have forgotten all you were, traded glory for savagery. Fitting.
AAD00100568	NVDLC04UlyssesFriendTaunt02
AAD00100569	Mercy killings - let them rest.
AAD00100570	NVDLC04UlyssesFriendTaunt01
AAD00100571	Beasts from the Divide. To the Divide, they return.
AAD00100572	NVDLC04UlyssesFriendMMWithSatchelCharge
AAD00100573	Watch the floor. Mines. Tactics of the Bear.
AAD00100574	NVDLC04UlyssesFriendMarkedMenEnter
AAD00100575	They come for us,  East and West alike.
AAD00100576	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatTaunt03
AAD00100577	Running out of time, Courier.
AAD00100578	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatTaunt02
AAD00100579	Come all this way - to die alone.
AAD00100580	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatTaunt01
AAD00100581	I'll end you - and your history.
AAD00100582	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatMarkedMenKilled02
AAD00100583	Killing them is mercy.
AAD00100584	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatEyebotDestroyed02
AAD00100585	Don't need Old World medicine to kill you.
AAD00100586	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatMarkedMenKilled01
AAD00100587	Kill as many as you want - the Divide will birth more.
AAD00100588	NVDLC04UlyssesCombatEyebotDestroyed01
AAD00100589	Destroying my machines won't help you. This facility will make more.
AAD00100590	How are you speaking through ED-E?
AAD00100591	The idea of a machine bearing a message new to you? Thought that was how House relayed all his messages... through his robots.
AAD00100592	The machine... the robot. No, not Legion... less history than that.
AAD00100593	Last I heard, Legion didn't use machines as mouthpieces to hide from their enemy.
AAD00100594	The robot with you... all of them are machines - radios, Old World tech reshaped with new hands. Historians. Couriers, carrying messages.
AAD00100595	Seen them as I've walked the Divide, tending other machines. That one... sealed inside the Hopeville silo. Sign America is waking up.
AAD00100596	It will follow you, obey you. Carry it until we are face to face, then there'll be no more need for it to carry my words.
AAD00100597	Maybe you better tell me who you are, and what you want.
AAD00100598	I'm a courier. Courier Six... was Courier Six. Like you - and not like you, in all the ways that matter.
AAD00100599	Spent too many years looking for you - now, letting you come to me.
AAD00100600	Thought carrying that Chip would end you, no... you got lives in you, hard to kill. Storms, bullets... sand and wind, yet still you walk. For now.
AAD00100601	Enough talking. You went to a lot of trouble to lure me here, so let's get on with this.
AAD00100602	America sleeps ahead of you, its nightmares filled with quakes, storms. You'll need to find your own path.
AAD00100603	That means waking America's spears up from their slumber. There's ways - warheads set off the collapse, warheads could open the gates again.
AAD00100604	You're resourceful. That machine, robot with you - can help you find the warheads you need to destroy... and their trigger, the detonator.
AAD00100605	The way ahead is below. The tools are there. The rest - up to you.
AAD00100606	Those... troops, NCR or Legion, the ones in the silo were already dead.
AAD00100607	Are those the bodies I saw in the silo? The soldiers that look like they'd been flayed?
AAD00100608	If you saw their corpses, you saw mercy. Got what they deserved, coming to the Divide.
AAD00100609	The Bear and Bull - NCR, Legion - came in waves. Before. And after. Right into the invisible fires... the wind, ground... collapsing beneath them.
AAD00100610	Once under different flags, now they are equal in their hatred of the trespassers. You and I.
AAD00100611	What is this place?
AAD00100612	The Divide... this place is a slice of it. Old military. Can still smell the pride - and the fear.
AAD00100613	Hope of the Old World, wrapped in fencing, covered in storm. Got new inhabitants now other than ghosts, more recent... recruits.
AAD00100614	Fine. I'll find this trigger - then I'll come find you.
AAD00100615	The Divide will send its worst against you - it may break you. We'll see if you're stronger.
AAD00100616	Road gets rougher from here... Courier. Left marks for you, colors'll tell the way - if you're smart.
AAD00100617	They'll lead you to your home one more time, lead to the ending of it - maybe remind you why you wander.
AAD00100618	I'm not planning to go into the Divide after you.
AAD00100619	No Courier would go to the Divide... but you will. And that's what sets us apart - we walk roads no other Courier will walk.
AAD00100620	And for you... you'll want to see your home one last time, see what happened.
AAD00100621	You're curious. You walk, leave ruin in your path... you can't leave alone. Still, the choice is yours... what I offer, it's the last I offer you.
AAD00100622	I don't care if you walk the Divide. Turn, walk the Mojave, fight beneath the flags... but you'll wonder.
AAD00100623	If you don't, the Divide will come to you, and the Mojave. That will be my message to you, like the message you had for me.
AAD00100624	You think I'm coming after you? Think again.
AAD00100625	The Long 15 is no more. The main supply line into NCR is cut.
AAD00100626	No damage done, not yet. Maybe in years. Keeps the Bear fenced... if Caesar can't drive it back, fire might.
AAD00100627	Only delays the end for the Bull, a new wall for them to scale and cross... once they're done with the Mojave. And Hoover Dam.
AAD00100628	Never again do you or any other courier and caravan need walk that route. Let the Mojave breathe without that asphalt scar raking it.
AAD00100629	Dry Wells is destroyed - that was your birthplace?
AAD00100630	No, opposite of that. It's where my tribe was taken. Where another history was put to the blade, lesson taught.
AAD00100631	It is where we realized Vulpes did not approach us as equals. Where we realized the wolf had come, and we watched our history die.
AAD00100632	Now it belongs to Legion... and all the death there now belongs to them as well. Not revenge... just the way of things when you own them.
AAD00100633	I wanted to hear more about Hoover Dam.
AAD00100634	Old World wall, run red with blood of Bear and Bull. It'll bleed more before the sun sets on the Mojave.
AAD00100635	That place and I have a past, owe it a debt - and it owes me. If your path takes you there, know you're not the only one.
AAD00100636	It's the wall by which this age will be measured, the gravestone of the Mojave. Old World never meant it as such.
AAD00100637	What are you doing here?
AAD00100638	A question one could have asked you not long ago, before walking the road West into the storms.
AAD00100639	Need to be here, see what was done. It's custom of the Bear to never see the marks it claws in the land... not my custom.
AAD00100640	Maybe that's why you've come, too - need to see where the missile from Ashton touched ground down below, in Hopeville... the Courier's Mile.
AAD00100641	Need to be here, see what was done. In the Divide, in Hopeville... the Courier's Mile.
AAD00100642	Can you tell me again what you're doing here?
AAD00100643	Was hoping you could help me shape something.
AAD00100644	Let's see what gifts the Mojave has for us.
AAD00100645	Let's make something new from the old.
AAD00100646	Forget this. I'm going to teach you what crossing the wrong Courier means.
AAD00100647	I've never seen creatures like that before now.
AAD00100648	What did you mean, "slower death for the Mojave?"
AAD00100649	[SUCCEEDED] Death'll come from below. In the Divide, need to watch the sky and ground... Mojave'll be easy prey for them.
AAD00100650	When you say, "slower death for the Mojave," you mean they're spreading out from the Divide.
AAD00100651	[FAILED] Mojave needs to survive itself first... does that, Tunnelers will be next on the list.
AAD00100652	If this is the High Road... where does it lead?
AAD00100653	At the end of the High Road lies Ashton - its silo.
AAD00100654	That machine with you, it can open it, wake it up, like it did the one in Hopeville.
AAD00100655	Some of the flayed Hopeville soldiers looked like NCR... but fought beside others in Legion armor.
AAD00100656	You see true. Not scavengers... it's what they wore before this all happened.
AAD00100657	[NCR] Those soldiers in Hopeville... were once NCR, I'm sure of it. Why were they with the Legion?
AAD00100658	Pain makes for strange allies... the hate the Bear and Bull shared across the battlefield, now turned against the Divide. Few survived... intact.
AAD00100659	Many NCR were already here when the destruction happened. Keeping the route East open, in fear of Caesar. Fear of the Legion.
AAD00100660	Those Marked Men in Hopeville - some had strange masks and blades I'd never seen before.
AAD00100661	You haven't seen enough of the Legion yet to see what they worship... what they hold on to, even after what happened to them.
AAD00100662	[Legion] Those Legionnaires in Hopeville wore Legion armor - and strange masks and blades.
AAD00100663	They bear false versions of Legate Lanius' mask, the one Caesar fashioned for him. Thought it was an insult at first.... know better now.
AAD00100664	It's shaped from Divide metal, not with care and strength, but with hate. Keeps them anchored.
AAD00100665	Crude, effective - like the blades they carry, distant mirrors of their Legate. A symbol they can hold on to - while the Divide tears at them.
AAD00100666	What were the creatures in the underpass?
AAD00100667	Tunnelers. Predators that make their own roads beneath the ground here.
AAD00100668	Divide broke their sky, showed them the world above - and the scent of new prey.
AAD00100669	Be a slower death for the Mojave than bombs and fire... but they'll come for its people, from where they least expect - below.
AAD00100670	Enough of this. Tell me where you are.
AAD00100671	What happened here?
AAD00100672	You delivered a package. Had markings that matched those in the Divide. Not all... but enough.
AAD00100673	Military markings, from some place the Bear had savaged in the West. Maybe seeing those markings on it reminded you of home... made you carry it.
AAD00100674	This canyon is miles long - maybe longer. Where can I find you?
AAD00100675	At the end of the Divide, through the trenches and wreckage - that's where you'll find me. My new home, here, amongst dead men.
AAD00100676	You and that machine, keep your eyes on the tower that cuts the horizon... you'll find your way. Made it this far... not much farther to go.
AAD00100677	I'm not interested in talking - only getting through this.
AAD00100678	NVDLC04UlyssesBigMT1HolotapeNote
AAD00100679	...back again. Left that crater behind. Got a few holotapes left, ones from the medical center.
AAD00100680	The woman... she fixed the recorder. Said it wouldn't last, repayment for me fixing her. She doesn't like debts, can respect that.
AAD00100681	Payment enough, just to hear someone who believes in the Brotherhood of Steel. Not Elijah. Different view. Same madness.
AAD00100682	She answered me on their philosophy, their way of seeing - the roads they walk. Dead-ends. Empty... as if technology can solve anything.
AAD00100683	Big Empty's proof where that road leads. Just like the Divide, and all the roads that lead to it.
AAD00100684	NVDLC04UlyssesWhiteLegs2HolotapeNote
AAD00100685	I walked the Great Salt Lake as Caesar's eye, then his hand.
AAD00100686	Mongrels there, two-legs and four. Saw the walls of New Canaan the scavengers circled... hadn't the strength or fire to take. Too high, too strong.
AAD00100687	White Legs, they were born for war, they run to it, hungry for battle... yet their hunger is to be a part of history, something larger.
AAD00100688	Like the Legion. As always, brought them a message - from Caesar.
AAD00100689	If New Canaan burns, Caesar might see them. "Might." Even the chance was a lie.
AAD00100690	To honor Caesar - destroy the history of New Canaan, and the way they carry it - in their generations and family.
AAD00100691	Caesar respects such strength, I told them. That - that was truth, even if "strength" wasn't the word. Obedience.
AAD00100692	You must be willing to kill anyone, children, mothers, the weak, elders... if these New Canaanites value the generations, that is what you must kill.
AAD00100693	It was like Vulpes was speaking through me. Use the night, silence, and fire to change their words to pleas, to screams.
AAD00100694	No need for bombs when hate will do.
AAD00100695	I... asked the White Legs to destroy a people with ancestry, going back thousands of years - another death of history, lost to time.
AAD00100696	The New Canaanites... they supplied medicine. Food, traded with others. Civilization, a hand from the past, not history...
AAD00100697	...but maybe a past deeper, farther than that to a place where this... God really exists.
AAD00100698	If so, his handiwork and people belong elsewhere, not in this place. Another symbol, like Bear and Bull, with no meaning in the present.
AAD00100699	NVDLC04UlyssesWhiteLegs1HolotapeNote
AAD00100700	Emptiness here - like the sands of the Great Salt Lake, echoed. The beating in the Divide sky... like storm drums of the White Legs.
AAD00100701	Ran with them on the salt beds, at Caesar's command - cut the throats of the two-headed Bear, cut all communities off.
AAD00100702	Use storm, sky. Disease. Fire, starvation... and the violence of the ignorant to ruin all who could... might stand against him.
AAD00100703	But the White Legs... they couldn't live on their own, like most scavengers. So gave them purpose - turned their hunger into a weapon.
AAD00100704	The wall of New Canaan... too high for Caesar. Too proud, maybe - or maybe something there, from his past, that needed killing. Memory of Graham.
AAD00100705	Helped them dig out Canaan supply caches, and other secrets the sands hid - bunkers, filled with powered weapons even the Brotherhood might desire.
AAD00100706	They called these new weapons "storm drums" in the firing of shells. Taught them the power in the casings... to channel the spirits in their guns.
AAD00100707	Me... they called me the Flag-Bearer. Glory in my hand, in my staff that still bore the weight of the Old World just as the symbol on my back did.
AAD00100708	I learned their weapons as a means of respect. And when it came their turn to pay respect to me... history came rushing back.
AAD00100709	Can't escape what's been done. History's there... no matter how far you walk.
AAD00100710	NVDLC04UlyssesBigMT3HolotapeNote
AAD00100711	Have you ever wanted to speak to history - just to know the why of it? I don't. Not any longer.
AAD00100712	There's old stories about gods and men, past history, into myth - where the gods, they're like children... petulant, cruel.
AAD00100713	Those were the voices of the Big Empty, the past. Couldn't leave well enough alone, had to ask. Had to ask the why of it.
AAD00100714	Their answers were madness. And power, stronger than me, would take a hundred Elijahs... someone tougher than him or I to best them in their Dome.
AAD00100715	They didn't know why they were there, what had led to that point, their names - like serpents devouring themselves, cannibalizing their own thoughts.
AAD00100716	When all seemed lost, thought it was the end - my anger gave me strength to ask them my last question.
AAD00100717	"Who are you, that do not know your history?"
AAD00100718	And they awoke. For... a short time.
AAD00100719	The flag you wear, they said. We remember. America.
AAD00100720	It wasn't just a flag to them... it was a place, an idea they had cared for. Once.
AAD00100721	They told me what it was like to grow in that world... all they had done to lift it up... protect it. They... didn't know it was gone, that...
AAD00100722	...yet they had cared once. Before forgetting their history.
AAD00100723	As they were talking... kept seeing the Courier's shadow behind them, giving each their words weight. History cast aside... a home, left behind.
AAD00100724	I listened. I asked. Was there anything left? Anything that still carries America's voice?
AAD00100725	And they told me I had already been there. I and one other, walking right out of history deeper than we knew.
AAD00100726	They told me what lies in the heart of the Divide, what can be found there. And the words to awaken it - and the one to speak them.
AAD00100727	NVDLC04UlyssesBigMT2HolotapeNote
AAD00100728	Big Empty - there's something hidden there, a crater, past wind and sand - so deep in the desert, there's no turning back.
AAD00100729	Finding the crater was an accident, was following the weather patterns - the Divide sky torn like that, man's violence, not nature's.
AAD00100730	That violence in the sky, had a source. Tracked it. Like following a river current.
AAD00100731	Left the colors to mark my way, like always, case someone finds them, learns the pattern - the Courier might.
AAD00100732	When I thought sand and wind would never end... came to the crater.
AAD00100733	And there... there was an Old World facility, a weather station, at the edge, still raking the sky with electricity and generators.
AAD00100734	And beyond it... saw the rest of the Old World hell there, all carved up like garden plots. Had to see what was there, couldn't leave it be.
AAD00100735	Things sleep in the Big Empty, the Brotherhood woke them up - can't move quiet, any more than the two-headed Bear can.
AAD00100736	And when they woke up, it was like all of history waking up at once. Almost didn't make it out. Almost. Left with answers I never intended.
AAD00100737	NVDLC04UlyssesFinalMsgHolotape
AAD00100738	Last tape, last message. In case... you best me. If you're hearing this, you have, through blood or word.
AAD00100739	This message, and all that lies with it - it is for you, Courier. If you want to know the... why of things.
AAD00100740	This world, I've walked a good part of it... I stopped only because of you. What you did - gave me pause.
AAD00100741	Long ago, I crossed the Colorado, the first among the Legion to see Hoover Dam in all its glory... an Old World wall, yet bridging two sides.
AAD00100742	And beyond it, a symbol of a two-headed Bear, an idea great enough to challenge Caesar himself.
AAD00100743	Might kill him, taking it, whether he won or lost. The Bull needs to fight, needs the challenge, without it... it falters, dies in the dust.
AAD00100744	Might be a lesson there, in you and me. Leave the thought behind the message to you.
AAD00100745	My message is this - the destruction that has been wrought, at the Divide - or elsewhere, if you couldn't stop me...
AAD00100746	It can happen again. It will keep happening.
AAD00100747	If war doesn't change, men must change, and so must their symbols. Even if it is nothing at all, know what you follow, Courier...
AAD00100748	...just as I followed you, to the end. Whatever your symbol...
AAD00100749	...carry it on your back, and wear it proudly when you stand at Hoover Dam.
AAD00100750	NVDLC04UlyssesWhiteLegs3HolotapeNote
AAD00100751	The White Legs... meant to show respect, bribe me for Caesar's favor, echoing mannerisms and words...
AAD00100752	Showed them tech caches, taught them the workings of chamber and powder, spoke of Caesar's pride in those that used such things... lies. And...
AAD00100753	...and then... they tried to honor me - not the Legion.
AAD00100754	They brought me before the campfire one night, showed me how they changed themselves, how they wore their hair now.
AAD00100755	It was like my entire dead tribe in the firelight, teeth grinning red in the dark - eager corpses, blood-covered ghosts.
AAD00100756	They... had taken my braids, the way of the Twisted Hairs, as if it showed they were like me, of me...
AAD00100757	...while every knot in their braids spoke of raping, violence - and ignorance of what the knots meant. They thought to show respect... defiled it.
AAD00100758	Lost myself in trying to read the braids they wove, when I remembered they had put no meaning in it. They had no history of what it meant.
AAD00100759	They didn't even know the insult in the twists, knots... and Dry Wells came rushing back, the White Legs circled like that...
AAD00100760	It was like looking at the dead of my tribe, reborn as ghosts - hateful, hungry, bowing to Caesar. Another history... gone, carried by me alone.
AAD00100761	Find anything in the dust of Hopeville?
AAD00100762	Nothing but wind, sand... ash. More may reveal itself in time, not now.
AAD00100763	If you're determined, return, might be something new surfaces.
AAD00100764	Wind and blood has uncovered more beneath the soil.
AAD00100765	If you want these Old World relics, they're yours... better you carry them than the Marked Men.
AAD00100766	Any recipes you can teach?
AAD00100767	I have some materials I've gathered, if you wanted to take a look.
AAD00100768	Is this where you're making camp?
AAD00100769	Not a camp - vigil, maybe. Never claimed it as mine. If anyone owns the Divide... your claim is stronger than mine.
AAD00100770	Don't feel like adding a campfire to the ones that already burn below. If you brought Mojave gifts, might be able to shape something for the road.
AAD00100771	Depends what history has to say about them. There's a lot the land can provide... if you know the road that led to it.
AAD00100772	Mojave's got ways of healing most ills - if not, some tribe's usually found a way you didn't expect.
AAD00100773	Like Healing Powders. Tribes back West only use Xander and Broc flower. There's a way the Twin Mothers in the East used to brew it, though.
AAD00100774	Called it Bitter Drink, mixed up the Xander and Broc in a bottle, added some kick to it so your head doesn't get all clouded.
AAD00100775	Any recipes you can teach?
AAD00100776	Antivenom's helpful around the Mojave with the Bark Scorpions. Even one sting can kill you. Tunneler bite can be just as bad.
AAD00100777	My tribe, Twisted Hairs, had a better way than Antivenom, if you act fast.
AAD00100778	Snakebite Tourniquet - cuts off the venom, no need to scavenge glands and blood. Or drink that mess.
AAD00100779	Part of the reason we wore our hair like we did, like I do now.
AAD00100780	Here's some for the road - trick to making it's not hard. Get bit, hook and twist it. Fast as blinking, doesn't give poison time to sink in.
AAD00100781	Any more recipes.. or histories... you can teach?
AAD00100782	Nothing more than I've already shared. We'll have to keep with what we know. Tired of history's lessons, anyway.
AAD00100783	Any more recipes you can teach?
AAD00100784	I had other questions.
AAD00100785	Questions have a habit of making others.
AAD00100786	The Divide's irradiated... are you sure you want to stay here?
AAD00100787	The invisible fires burn here, true enough. Still... to have helped carry out such an act, then not face it...
AAD00100788	Not my way. If my life burns out here, so be it... until then, I wait and watch, see what the road brings.
AAD00100789	What about the Marked Men?
AAD00100790	That's part of why I'm here. Watch them - if they attack me, try to enter the Mojave, I answer. Not looking to kill them... save them, if I can.
AAD00100791	There might be something saving in them. If not, then what I do is mercy, not murder.
AAD00100792	What's the Courier's Mile? Is that where the Ashton missile hit?
AAD00100793	My name for it. If you have a better one, you grant it - my choice in names won't carry past you and I.
AAD00100794	Lies along the road, running from the Hopeville silo... straight on to where the ground burns, and wind howls even stronger than here.
AAD00100795	Your tapes prove you've walked the Mojave, yet learned the wrong lessons.
AAD00100796	Comes down to perspective, how far one's walked, and what they've left behind.
AAD00100797	If you challenge this moment, let's hear your perspective. If my words are all you have, let's hear them.
AAD00100798	So... you think dropping bombs on the Mojave is going to solve things?
AAD00100799	[SUCCEEDED] The why of it... you taught me the why of it.
AAD00100800	If you believe in something enough, you must be willing to let it burn, lest it claim you.
AAD00100801	These governments of the two-headed bear... the Legion... they carry Old World ideas into an age that no longer needs them, where they cannot live.
AAD00100802	I need to know why you're doing this - not for my sake, for history's sake.
AAD00100803	[FAILED] Yes, that is what you proved to me at the Divide - what is here, what you showed me... it is enough.
AAD00100804	You don't understand. You will.
AAD00100805	You've wasted enough of my time. Get ready to die.
AAD00100806	I'll finish history's work. If the Divide couldn't kill you... perhaps these spears of the Old World can.
AAD00100807	Let's end this, Courier, you and I. Here, with the Old World flag as witness.
AAD00100808	I've heard enough. You're a Legion traitor, and now you'll die.
AAD00100809	Forget this. If you want an ending to things, let's do this.
AAD00100810	Can you share the recipe with me?
AAD00100811	Can do that and one better... just enough around to mix some. Here - might make the Twin Mothers' history live a little longer, you carrying it.
AAD00100812	When you drink it, down it all in one shot, or your stomach's not going to want to keep going after the second drink.
AAD00100813	What's the history of it?
AAD00100814	History? Cures a wound, leaves the bitterness that caused it. The Twin Mothers were always about lessons.
AAD00100815	Caesar taught them the last one, though, so that's it for them. Recipe still exists, Legion uses it on forced marches with wounded soldiers.
AAD00100816	Wouldn't have made it through Crimson River Trail a few years back without it  - losing so much blood early on, was a Cazador feast.
AAD00100817	Enough Xander root and Broc flower along the trail though, the Legion was able to keep pace and get where they were going.
AAD00100818	Have you been to Hopeville since the Ashton missile hit?
AAD00100819	Walk there sometimes, keep the walks short. Still... it's important to see. Something else to answer for.
AAD00100820	Occasionally sift through the dust, the buildings... see if I can find some history. Marks of America.
AAD00100821	If you want them, keep them... you've earned it. Nothing to be gained by me holding them, and more will surface in time.
AAD00100822	Sounds useful. Have any to spare?
AAD00100823	You think I'd leave valuable property like you behind? No way. You might be worth some caps one day.
AAD00100824	Run off on me like that again and I'll recycle you into tin cans. I own you, robot.
AAD00100825	Sounds like a big damn waste of time to me.
AAD00100826	That's what all this was about? Some old pre-War kids' show?
AAD00100827	Heh heh. Robot skeet shooting. Sounds fun.
AAD00100828	Boo hoo, poor little robot lost his daddy. Stop moping, trash can.
AAD00100829	How long ago was this? And you still haven't made it? So much for upgraded navigational systems.
AAD00100830	Spill any of my secrets, and I'll spill your electronic guts. Just so we're clear.
AAD00100831	If you ask me, Whitley got too invested. It's just robot research, not having a kid.
AAD00100832	Big deal. You're a glorified computer, why bother switching you off to improve you?
AAD00100833	Fine, whatever. Listen, robot: I own you now. Follow me and try to make yourself useful.
AAD00100834	You'd better level with me, trashcan, or I might stuff you back in that pod.
AAD00100835	<Apologetic beeping>
AAD00100836	Yeah, he's probably dead. Guess that means I own you now.
AAD00100837	<Sad beeping>
AAD00100838	Great. Maybe you'll actually be useful to me, then.
AAD00100839	<Hopeful beeping>
AAD00100840	NVDLC04EndingSlideSunset02
AAD00100841	Men do, through the roads they walk.
AAD00100842	Women do, through the roads they walk.
AAD00100843	NVDLC04EndingSlideSunset01
AAD00100844	It's said war - war never changes.
AAD00100845	NVDLC04EndingSlideDivide02
AAD00100846	Tunnelers and the Marked Men... avoided the lone figure, as if recognizing the Courier's right to passage... or out of fear.
AAD00100847	NVDLC04EndingSlideDivide0
AAD00100848	As for the Courier... he turned his back on his home for the second time and made his way back, navigating the treachery of the Divide.
AAD00100849	As for the Courier... she turned her back on her home for the second time and made her way back, navigating the treachery of the Divide.
AAD00100850	NVDLC04EndingSlideEDESacrificed02
AAD00100851	As his last gesture, he sent one last signal to his counterpart in the Mojave, passing along what the Courier had taught him in the Divide.
AAD00100852	There was the chance... always, that ED-E's journey would continue, perhaps carried by another Eyebot in the Mojave...
AAD00100853	...the one from which the ED-E from the Divide had been shaped.
AAD00100854	For now, the Courier knew ED-E's history and could carry it, even if the Eyebot had forgotten.
AAD00100855	NVDLC04EndingSlideEDESacrificed01
AAD00100856	When ED-E's circuits burned in the fires of the Divide, there was one small part that held on until the end.
AAD00100857	It was the fragment that held the Old World memories and the words of his creator in his last moments.
AAD00100858	NVDLC04EndingSlideEDELeftBehind
AAD00100859	ED-E, the version given life by the machines of the Divide, remained frozen in the military installation where Ulysses had summoned him.
AAD00100860	The robot's last coded transmission back to his counterpart in the Mojave told of upgrades, unlocked memories... then silence.
AAD00100861	Not long after the Courier left the facility, the Eyebot's data banks were wiped, and it was disassembled as rapidly as it had been constructed.
AAD00100862	NVDLC04EndingSlideEDESaved02
AAD00100863	Before leaving, he sent a coded signal to his original in the Mojave, passing along what the Courier had taught him in the Divide.
AAD00100864	With that last farewell, he set off, carrying the song of Old World hope with him, which had given him strength and purpose on his journey.
AAD00100865	And no matter what, he knew there would be a second home to return to, Navarro or not - and that his creator would be proud.
AAD00100866	NVDLC04EndingEDESaved01
AAD00100867	ED-E, given second life by the machines of the Divide, freed by the Courier, continued his quest west, to Navarro...
AAD00100868	...or what remained of what the Eyebot considered "home." Whether he found his homeland or not, his road is unknown.
AAD00100869	It may be the journey meant more than the destination - just as his counterpart in the Mojave had learned.
AAD00100870	NVDLC04EndingUlyssesAlive02
AAD00100871	He remained there, perhaps as punishment for the scars he left on the wastes - or a reminder of a history he could not forget.
AAD00100872	For Ulysses... his journey was over. The Courier had been the end of his road.
AAD00100873	NVDLC04EndingUlyssesAlive01
AAD00100874	Hopeville burned lightless in the night, invisible fires of radiation scorching it from within and without.
AAD00100875	It is said a man still walked its streets, with a tattered jacket, an Old World flag etched on the back...
AAD00100876	NVDLC04EndingUlyssesDead02
AAD00100877	...though whether done as a sign of respect, or in anger for what had been endured to reach this moment - that is unknown.
AAD00100878	Interpretation is something best left to history, and only the surviving Courier would ever know for certain.
AAD00100879	NVDLC04EndingUlyssesDead01
AAD00100880	At the end of the struggle, only one Courier remained in the heart of the Divide. The true Courier, Courier Six.
AAD00100881	The Courier tore the ancient flag of the Commonwealth from its cables, and cast it over the corpse...
AAD00100882	NVDLC04EndingMissileLaunchLegion02
AAD00100883	But that message - it is something for Couriers to carry, and for them alone.
AAD00100884	The lights flickered across the Divide, reminders that the Old World histories persist, and find meaning in the present.
AAD00100885	NVDLC04EndingMissileLaunchLegion01
AAD00100886	The Courier walked until he stood again upon the edge of the Divide, the last road he would walk before the second battle for Hoover Dam.
AAD00100887	There, beside his feet, was a final package, from one Courier to another - a footlocker, bearing a gift, and a message.

AAD00100890	NVDLC04EndingMissileLaunchNCR02
AAD00100891	As catastrophic as the damage was for NCR, the act made the Courier stronger for having no history, and no retreat.
AAD00100892	It was an ending to things - a way of erasing the road that had led to this point and the history that had walked with it.
AAD00100893	It was an ending to things - a way of erasing the road that had led to this point and the history that had walked with it.
AAD00100894	NVDLC04EndingMissileLaunchNCR01
AAD00100895	...missiles fell on NCR and the Long 15 caravan route beyond the Mojave Outpost, the road the Courier had been walking when the tale began.
AAD00100896	Caravans and NCR outposts along the route were reduced to ash, an Old World gift from the Divide.
AAD00100897	...missiles fell on the East and the Legion encampment at Dry Wells... where the Twisted Hairs had allied, then been betrayed by Vulpes and Caesar.
AAD00100898	Legion soldiers died, their silhouettes blasted into the ground and earth, the last word of the last of the Twisted Hairs.

AAD00100901	Hey, is that an ArmCo Portable Reloading Bench built into you? That'll be handy.
AAD00100902	[FAILED] <Happy beeping>
AAD00100903	Do you do anything with bullets? Like, maybe help people make them?
AAD00100904	
AAD00100905	[SUCCEEDED] <Happy beeping>
AAD00100906	That's an impressive multitool suite you've got. I bet I could make all sorts of stuff with that.
AAD00100907	[FAILED] <Happy beeping>
AAD00100908	You look like a toolbox. Can you help me make stuff?
AAD00100909	
AAD00100910	[SUCCEEDED] <Happy beeping>
AAD00100911	If you drop the power output by .24, you'll be able to make more energy ammo with no quality loss.
AAD00100912	[FAILED] <Confused beeping>
AAD00100913	Wow, you're way better at fixing weapons than me!
AAD00100914	
AAD00100915	[SUCCEEDED] <Happy beeping>
AAD00100916	If you switched to the 3/8 wrench and the smaller drill, those weapon repairs would be easier.
AAD00100917	[FAILED] <Confused beeping>
AAD00100918	Wow, you're way better at fixing weapons than me!
AAD00100919	I don't need energy cells right now - I'd like some satchel charges, ED-E.
AAD00100920	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100921	Can you make me some flamer fuel instead of energy cells?
AAD00100922	<Happy beeping>
AAD00100923	
AAD00100924	[SUCCEEDED] <Happy beeping>
AAD00100925	Remove the safety catches on those Microfusion Cells and you could turn them into satchel charges.
AAD00100926	[FAILED] <Confused beeping>
AAD00100927	I want something that goes boom. Can you do that?
AAD00100928	
AAD00100929	[SUCCEEDED] <Happy beeping>
AAD00100930	You know, if you strip out the plasma relays on those energy cells, you could make flamer fuel.
AAD00100931	[FAILED] <Confused beeping>
AAD00100932	Could you maybe make some energy cells that catch fire instead?
AAD00100933	
AAD00100934	[SUCCEEDED] <Pleased beeping>
AAD00100935	That was a .308 round. Probably hand-loaded - that would have destroyed most robots your size.
AAD00100936	[FAILED] <Confused beeping>
AAD00100937	I thought all robots were bulletproof.
AAD00100938	Whatever, trashcan. I really don't give a shit about your problems.
AAD00100939	Whatever. I only rescued you for the fire support anyways.
AAD00100940	If you wanted me dead, why did you wait?
AAD00100941	Promises to keep. To others. And the Mojave's dangerous enough - left to the land, the land has its way.
AAD00100942	If I wanted you dead, we would have met sooner. Not sure that's the way this ends.
AAD00100943	Might be that history needs to have its say. If not, then messages will do.
AAD00100944	So you refused to deliver the Chip - what, to set me up to die?
AAD00100945	We all have death following us, only a question of how close. You dodged it - for a time. You're good at that, talent for it.
AAD00100946	With that Chip weighing you down... a burden, lets death move a little faster without me pulling the trigger.
AAD00100947	It sounds like you know me, but I've never met you.
AAD00100948	[SUCCEEDED] Words aren't the only way couriers meet... sometimes it's the paths we walk. But no... we've never spoken before now.
AAD00100949	We've never spoken before - I'd remember your voice.
AAD00100950	[FAILED] I know you. What we have in common, though, isn't in the words we traded.
AAD00100951	You were supposed to carry the Chip?
AAD00100952	Meant to? No. Never. Your burden.
AAD00100953	Weigh you down long enough to let death catch up to you... but you survived.
AAD00100954	There was death in that package, and while the Chip is important to Old World ghosts... no, you are more dangerous than that Chip ever could be.
AAD00100955	Maybe why you found each other, little piece of the Old World, speaking to you, waiting for you to wake something else up with it.
AAD00100956	[Legion] The dead in the silo, some were Legion Frumentarii, scouts. Assassins.
AAD00100957	Might have been. Once. To the Divide they came... in the Divide, they rest.
AAD00100958	[NCR] Those bodies in the silo were NCR soldiers... some special forces.
AAD00100959	Might have been. Once. To the Divide they came... in the Divide, they rest.
AAD00100960	What's here? This place looks wrecked.
AAD00100961	[SUCCEEDED] America sleeps in the Divide - giants, beneath the earth. You saw one locked in the silo beneath you. There's more.
AAD00100962	Only takes a few of them, locked below ground, to tear apart the earth... and cast dust, sand... ash... into the skies above.
AAD00100963	You'll see the extent - the miles of it, soon enough. You need to see it... walk it.
AAD00100964	Area looks like it was hit with earthquakes... or underground detonations.
AAD00100965	[FAILED] Wasn't always like this. Old World wreckage's nothing new... after that, something you had your hand in - you'll walk it soon enough.
AAD00100966	Why would they want to stay here if this place is killing them?
AAD00100967	[SUCCEEDED] There's truth in your words, in what I've seen of their tactics, movements - recovery. Those wounds - they couldn't live otherwise.
AAD00100968	The Divide winds have torn the skin from many of them - may be the radiation is the only thing keeping them walking.
AAD00100969	Make camp near silos... warheads. No way to cleanse the radiation - makes them hard to kill there, have to draw them out.
AAD00100970	Radiation may keep them alive in areas so physically punishing, it would kill others - even ghouls.
AAD00100971	[FAILED] They're more beasts than men now. They clutch at their pain as they clutch at their weapons... anchors them.
AAD00100972	The rads in this place seem like they would do more damage to them.
AAD00100973	[SUCCEEDED] There's truth in your words, in what I've seen of their tactics, movements - recovery. Those wounds - they couldn't live otherwise.
AAD00100974	The Divide winds have torn the skin from many of them - may be the radiation is the only thing keeping them walking.
AAD00100975	Make camp near silos... warheads. No way to cleanse the radiation - makes them hard to kill there, have to draw them out.
AAD00100976	If they've become ghouls, the radiation would strengthen them. Heal their wounds - not the scars.
AAD00100977	[FAILED] They're more beasts than men now. They clutch at their pain as they clutch at their weapons... anchors them.
AAD00100978	They look like they were skinned... then got right back up.
AAD00100979	But... even radiation isn't enough to cause those wounds.
AAD00100980	I've never seen corpses mutilated like that.
AAD00100981	Even as the fires here burned them from within... the winds of the Divide tore their skin, exposed them... screaming... to the sky.
AAD00100982	And just as the Divide tears at them, so they tear at each other, for sport - like some tribal scarification. Falling back to their history, maybe.
AAD00100983	No matter what they suffer... the radiation, fire of the Divide, sustains them. Makes them stronger.
AAD00100984	What are you talking about?
AAD00100985	Whatever happened at the Divide, there weren't any survivors.
AAD00100986	Inhabitants? It doesn't look like anyone's alive down there.
AAD00100987	These new inhabitants... not natives... most of them. Came with duty, purpose... ready to kill each other. The Divide was stronger.
AAD00100988	Left marks on them, too. Not Bear, not Bull - now... radiation's marked them, made them equal in history's eyes.
AAD00100989	As vicious as the storms are, these shadows of Legion, of NCR - silhouettes of things to come.
AAD00100990	Forget this. What do you want?
AAD00100991	An ending. To this road, you and I. First, you need to find your way. At the end, I'll be waiting.
AAD00100992	< Storage Node. Do not translate. >
AAD00100993	You may not know my voice, but we've walked the same places. The Long 15 to Primm... that wasn't the only road you ever walked.
AAD00100994	I've been to your home, the place you kept returning to... may not be the place you were born, was the place you gave life to, same thing.
AAD00100995	People forget couriers can keep communities alive... until the day they're gone, and their breath catches in their throat.
AAD00100996	For now, eyes alert, watch the streets below. There's still life in the Divide - threats other than the storms and wind... new inhabitants.
AAD00100997	There's something left down there? Town looks like it was bombed.
AAD00100998	[SUCCEEDED] America sleeps in the Divide - giants, beneath the earth. You saw one locked in the silo beneath you. There's more.
AAD00100999	Only takes a few of them, locked below ground, to tear apart the earth... and cast dust, sand... ash... into the skies above.
AAD00101000	The damage here looks like it was caused by underground detonations - on a scale I've never seen.
AAD00101001	[FAILED] Wasn't always like this. Old World wreckage's nothing new... after that, something you had your hand in - you'll walk it soon enough.
AAD00101002	The Divide won't stop me from reaching you, trust me.
AAD00101003	You better hope you've got enough ammo when I kick down your door.
AAD00101004	I don't care what you have to say. I only want to know where you are.
AAD00101005	Other Marked Men had NCR gear - and they weren't carrying masks or blades.
AAD00101006	For the two-headed Bear... NCR... they don't have symbols in the same way Legion does.
AAD00101007	They revere their mines and explosives, guns... that is their religion - death from afar, take pride in it.
AAD00101008	I could care less about history - and even less about Caesar.
AAD00101009	Wasn't his time, and wouldn't have been how he wanted to die.
AAD00101010	Not how most would've wanted him to die, either, Bear or Bull.
AAD00101011	I wasn't sure how you'd take it.
AAD00101012	Done with blame, and Caesar was big on strength making right. Seems to me you proved that philosophy to him.
AAD00101013	If he was too weak to stop you, too weak to defend himself, then he needed to die with his beliefs.
AAD00101014	Are you angry at all?
AAD00101015	He let another hold a knife to him. If he was weak enough to allow the knife so close to his neck, maybe it needed to be his ending.
AAD00101016	Caesar would be history's hypocrite if he was angry about what happened. I'm not one for it, either.
AAD00101017	Seems you just proved his philosophy to him. If he'd been stronger, he'd be alive, and we wouldn't be talking.
AAD00101018	< Topic Storage: Discussing Caesar's Death. Do not translate. >
AAD00101019	Unless you do the same for the Legate that comes, you'll get no thanks from me. When that Monster arrives, he's not going to have a leash.
AAD00101020	Caesar could command him. Not now. The Bear's going to burn, and burn slow.
AAD00101021	Caesar is dead, died on the operating table.
AAD00101022	Name's died twice to history. If the West thanks you... the East won't, in time. Fall apart, back to the tribes, maybe.
AAD00101023	Caesar is dead, I killed him.
AAD00101024	Name's died twice to history. If the West thanks you... the East won't, in time. Fall apart, back to the tribes, maybe.
AAD00101025	< Topic Storage: Wrapping up thoughts on House. Do not translate. >
AAD00101026	Let House sleep in his chamber. Let him dream of the Old World he remembers, and keep those memories where they belong, in his head.
AAD00101027	If Vegas falls apart, seems like more history will be lost.
AAD00101028	Thought you might be glad House was dealt with.
AAD00101029	What you did was for the best. The Old World died long ago. Anyone who believes they can make it return and everything will be as it was...
AAD00101030	...it is a dangerous belief. Needs to be silenced before their belief spreads.
AAD00101031	I reached Vegas, and I dealt with House.
AAD00101032	House spoke, acted through machines. Sometimes can judge a man by his messengers. Sometimes the messengers judge him.
AAD00101033	Wonder what happens to Vegas now. The tribes - families. We'll see.
AAD00101034	Nah, I think I'll just go ahead and trigger the launch. I never liked either of those places.
AAD00101035	We'll leave it to history, then.
AAD00101036	The Divide belongs to history now. The Mojave awaits.
AAD00101037	We'll leave it to history, then.
AAD00101038	I'll remember that.
AAD00101039	The Divide belongs to history now. The Mojave awaits.
AAD00101040	I'll remember that.
AAD00101041	< Topic Storage: Talking about Joshua Graham, why Lanius should heed story. Do not translate. >
AAD00101042	That Legate's mistake is he didn't die trying. His name was Joshua - Joshua Graham. Answered for his failure - twice, some say.
AAD00101043	Caesar had him burned and cast into the earth, into the largest canyon you've ever seen. Watched the flames trail all the way to the bottom.
AAD00101044	Somehow Joshua walked away from that, went beyond Caesar's gaze. His footsteps trailing fire, walking from one hell - maybe to another.
AAD00101045	When one is ruined like Graham was... sometimes home is the only place left. If so, he went to New Canaan, Caesar's anger written on him like a book.
AAD00101046	Caesar's orders to the Frumentarii were to watch for him, find Graham. Kill him. Didn't try. Could've, no good would have come of it.
AAD00101047	Graham earned his life, and his nature... it'll kill him more surely than any blade of the Legion.
AAD00101048	So if you've heard word of it or seen sign of him, let it keep. Let his history keep.
AAD00101049	What do you mean?
AAD00101050	There are other Legates, and the one before Lanius couldn't take Hoover Dam for Caesar.
AAD00101051	Other Legates? You mean Graham.
AAD00101052	Yes. Graham was broken on the wall of the Dam.
AAD00101053	Other Legates?
AAD00101054	There are other Legates, and the one before Lanius couldn't take Hoover Dam for Caesar.
AAD00101055	He must have a weakness.
AAD00101056	His strength lies in his title - and it is his weakness. He will not fight a losing battle and destroy what he represents.
AAD00101057	Put the idea of loss in him. Convince him the Bear will not be the twentieth tribe beneath his heel, it will make him pause like nothing on earth.
AAD00101058	You do not need to convince him alone. Draw upon history. The past of other Legates are not filled with victories. Remind Lanius of this.
AAD00101059	Any idea on how to beat him?
AAD00101060	Nineteen tribes could not do it. All the lights in Vegas cannot.
AAD00101061	Why is he coming West?
AAD00101062	To take Hoover Dam, Legion will need something as big as the Old World itself - another symbol, forged by history.
AAD00101063	Well, if I were a slave or a dog, I'd be scared.
AAD00101064	He's just one general. I can handle him.
AAD00101065	Lanius carries all the terrors of the East with him. He's the myth, the weapon the Legion needs.
AAD00101066	When he arrives, he'll fall on Hoover Dam like a hammer, break the Bear in two.
AAD00101067	What can you tell me about him?
AAD00101068	Enough. Whatever waits at Hoover Dam, I'm ready.
AAD00101069	Then there is nothing more to be done. The Mojave awaits.
AAD00101070	The Divide belongs to history now. The Mojave awaits.
AAD00101071	Enough. Whatever waits at Hoover Dam, I'm ready.
AAD00101072	The Divide belongs to history now. The Mojave awaits.
AAD00101073	Who is Legate Lanius?
AAD00101074	Lanius... the "Butcher." Monster, Terror of the East.
AAD00101075	Not even his slaves have seen his face - struck them blind so they can't. Wears a mask, don't even know if it's the same man.
AAD00101076	He put Colorado to the sword, broke the Hangdogs by throwing their hounds upon the flames, so they might burn forever in the afterlife.
AAD00101077	< Topic Storage: As player turns to leave, Ulysses speaks of Lanius. Do not translate. >
AAD00101078	A warning, though - the Legate, Lanius. Whether Caesar stands or not, Lanius will come.
AAD00101079	Look, we don't need to fight about this - we can talk this out, right?
AAD00101080	[SUCCEEDED] No... no, I couldn't. And I'm thinking you can't kill me, either. If you did, you'd answer for it, just as I would.
AAD00101081	Let the land do the killing for you, that's one of the things you taught me.
AAD00101082	Killing is personal - so's vows, promises. Last bit's more important to me than the first.
AAD00101083	You brought me here to talk. If you wanted to kill me, you'd have waited until I came for the Chip.
AAD00101084	[FAILED] Talking... words won't settle this. The Road will. And the end.
AAD00101085	So... this is about fighting? Or...?
AAD00101086	[SUCCEEDED] War. Call it that. Our part in it.
AAD00101087	Ulysses wasn't made for the flag he followed. He wasn't made for peace. That's the lesson.
AAD00101088	If you follow a symbol to the end, ask yourself what that means. More important, ask what happens after the end.
AAD00101089	You chose Ulysses because of the "two flags" reference - is that tied to the war in the Mojave?
AAD00101090	[FAILED] Fighting? Yes... but different weapons than you're used to.
AAD00101091	You're wasting time. Stalling. Won't help you.
AAD00101092	Ulysses... that sounds like a Legion name... a Legion hero?
AAD00101093	[SUCCEEDED] History. Yes.
AAD00101094	Ulysses walked a hard road. A general, like Caesar and Oliver. He was Brahmin-stubborn, gave him strength on the battlefield.
AAD00101095	He led his side to victory, turned two flags into one. That's when he lost - when the fighting was done, the sickness took hold.
AAD00101096	Lesson there, if history's to be believed. One you should heed.
AAD00101097	"Ulysses." Not the myth. You're honoring history, not stories.
AAD00101098	[FAILED] Search history, might find meaning in it.
AAD00101099	It's just a name - you have no idea who I am. You'll know by the end.
AAD00101100	So you're the one who sent the radio message - Ulysses.
AAD00101101	Not my given name, close enough.
AAD00101102	Took it from history, found it in a book. It's an Old World name.
AAD00101103	Ulysses lived a long time ago, long before the Old World set fire to itself. He made a mark without being myth.
AAD00101104	Had to fight during a time when his world had two flags, and he had to make them one.
AAD00101105	Forget your name. Back to the job you refused.
AAD00101106	All right... Courier. If the why of it matters to you.
AAD00101107	You're not making any sense.
AAD00101108	Wait... so you swore not to kill me? Why?
AAD00101109	What kind of world would this be if Courier killed Courier.
AAD00101110	You've got enough distance ahead of you - save your breath for the road, don't waste it on words.
AAD00101111	I'm not interested in your politics.
AAD00101112	Maybe that's why you chose Vegas... the lights can blind, make people forget themselves. Their convictions - vows. 
AAD00101113	Not going to waste time trying to make the blind see. Took a chance coming here - same as I did. Now we'll see how it plays out.
AAD00101114	We're too far from Vegas to argue perspective on it.
AAD00101115	Maybe not. Maybe that's why you fell in with the Bear in the first place - can't see what you're following.
AAD00101116	Not going to convince a deaf man with words. Shown strength coming in here - if strength's what you respect, then you belong East of the Colorado.
AAD00101117	At least they're trying to help the Mojave.
AAD00101118	Trying doesn't hold much weight with me. Legion doesn't try to kill people, they do it. The Bear kills people trying to protect them.
AAD00101119	Irony's sharp. And Legion... their flag may be old, but it's not at war with itself.
AAD00101120	No matter now. Bear couldn't hold the Divide.
AAD00101121	You and that machine, are all that remains of NCR here... rest fell to radiation, fire... and what burrows below.
AAD00101122	You've got a better way?
AAD00101123	Yes. And any Courier could tell you the same, see it everywhere. The Bear...
AAD00101124	...Bear's too busy carving up the Mojave with knives, roads, borders, and how things should be to see how it is.
AAD00101125	They're stretched thin, can't protect their frontlines, their towns, think paper's power, radio means control - all of it, useless.
AAD00101126	You have a lot of hate for NCR. That kind of hate isn't new in the Mojave.
AAD00101127	No... not new. And not new among all those in the shadow of the Bear.
AAD00101128	You know their flag, a bear with two heads. Symbol's an Old World one, had one head then, better off for it.
AAD00101129	Their flag speaks to their spirit. They're split like any two-headed animal, trying to go in different directions, ending up nowhere.
AAD00101130	In the Mojave, that'll only get you sand between your fingers - or over your grave.
AAD00101131	Is New Vegas's power a threat to you?
AAD00101132	Power isn't strength. Power can wall off someone, when they believe it's freed them.
AAD00101133	House's power... you've seen the wall around Vegas. He gains more power, that wall will grow. The Mojave'll become Vegas.
AAD00101134	But it's more lights than strength. You'll see the way of it soon enough.
AAD00101135	Is that why you're not Legion anymore, then?
AAD00101136	What do you m... I see the way of it. Have fight in you, at least. Save it for the road ahead.
AAD00101137	A woman in the Legion surprise you?
AAD00101138	It's not Legion - the Legion I know, but they change, even in small ways as they march West, with every tribe they break.
AAD00101139	But yes... last I heard, you needed a weapon between your legs to carry one for Caesar.
AAD00101140	"Brothers?" So - you're Legion, too.
AAD00101141	I hold Legion to be my brothers... even as misguided as they are. And you... more so than most.
AAD00101142	< Storage Node Ulysses talking about player being Legion. Do not translate. >
AAD00101143	Heard tales of you walking the Mojave. Casting off your disguise... yet you carried that Chip, determined to take it to Vegas... not Caesar.
AAD00101144	You and that Chip deserve each other, 29 fewer coins than other traitors have carried, by history's mark.
AAD00101145	The Mojave is behind us. I want to know what's ahead.
AAD00101146	The High Road... not the Divide yet, many more miles to walk. But you got this far. You and that machine that shadows you.
AAD00101147	Wasn't sure if both of you'd make it - above, then below the underpass.
AAD00101148	Forget this. Keep your opinions about Vegas, I'll keep mine.
AAD00101149	I doubt you've ever met House.
AAD00101150	No... only seen his works. Those he's broken with light and gold. His messengers.
AAD00101151	But everything in Vegas speaks of someone who can't let go.
AAD00101152	House takes a shovel to history's graves, props up the dead, then puts words in their mouths. The tribes don't even know how they were broken.
AAD00101153	Not a world I want to be part of, going through motions until we're all smiling faces on some robot's screen.
AAD00101154	House is more pragmatic than you might think.
AAD00101155	Believe that. Vegas runs, I've seen what it's done to those who oppose it. And I've seen its messengers.
AAD00101156	Tribes? You mean the Vegas families?
AAD00101157	Families of Vegas were once tribes. Got drunk on the Vegas lights, the spirit bled out of them. Old World history, under a different flag.
AAD00101158	Whatever traditions or rituals they had, most likely squeezed out of them by now, turned into something else.
AAD00101159	And if not, then I'm afraid what's going to happen when they come creeping back.
AAD00101160	Vegas is one of the safest places in the Mojave, and that gives me hope.
AAD00101161	You've been, you've seen the Wall. Safe? No... what's inside - that's what worries me.
AAD00101162	Inside, Old World's waking up. No facts or history I've heard tells me that city ever went to sleep, and that makes me think.
AAD00101163	The blue of the Mojave skies - isn't like the rest of the world. Don't hear a Geiger ticking there, more to fear from predators than rads.
AAD00101164	The city - the whole Mojave, wasn't hit by bombs. Been my call, Vegas would be one of the first pieces of the Old World to burn.
AAD00101165	Someone protected it. Wasn't chance, wasn't luck. Something larger - yet they let the rest of the world suffer. And they'll do it again.
AAD00101166	What did you mean before, "it's a dance?"
AAD00101167	That's the wrong word. "Theater" is better - the families, the Bear all on a stage.
AAD00101168	House. He's the one watching. The why... you'd know better than I would. If you don't - you will.
AAD00101169	House's plans for the future run longer than that.
AAD00101170	What do you have against Vegas?
AAD00101171	Vegas is Old World, filled with Old World ghosts. And ghosts need the living to do their work.
AAD00101172	That's why the families are there, why the Bear stumbles there to lose itself. It's a dance, I don't know its purpose.
AAD00101173	You've been, you've seen the Wall. It's what's inside that worries me.
AAD00101174	Don't be quick to discount Vegas. There's more strength there than may seem.
AAD00101175	As obsessed as you are about history, the future's what I prefer.
AAD00101176	Your future with House has two roads. The road the tribals in Vegas walked... their spirits crushed...
AAD00101177	...or your face on a robot servant, smiling forever in a dead casino. There's future in neither.
AAD00101178	< Storage Node Ulysses giving player final direction. Do not translate. >
AAD00101179	For now - find the trigger for the warheads, buried in Hopeville. Use it to keep moving... and keep alive.
AAD00101180	Wait... there's more I wanted to talk about. About... all this.
AAD00101181	[SUCCEEDED] "Who are you, who do not know your history?"
AAD00101182	You came all this way for answers. Only currency I have, nothing else to be gained - could turn around, walk away at any time.
AAD00101183	If history matters to you... you'll need to earn it. Any logs of mine I have already cast away in the Divide, they're lost to you.
AAD00101184	If we share history, then before going forward, I want to know the past.
AAD00101185	[FAILED] You want to know more, keep walking.
AAD00101186	I'll give answers as you go. Not before.
AAD00101187	Are you saying... they were here before all this destruction?
AAD00101188	[SUCCEEDED] Makes sense. Truth favors that, matches the history of this place.
AAD00101189	Were signs they were here for a long time, before Marked Men, before what happened to the Divide cracked their sky.
AAD00101190	If so, they were buried deep. Might have been born the day America's embers started to settle. Seen worse things twisted by radiation.
AAD00101191	Radiation from the War might have created them. Then detonations, quakes, caused them to surface?
AAD00101192	[FAILED] Don't know the history of them - only their patterns, how they hunt.
AAD00101193	Still, takes a long time for such patterns to develop. A longer history than what happened here.
AAD00101194	< Storage Node: Ulysses discussing Denver and the East. Do not Translate. >
AAD00101195	Walked the East, too, before the Bull came. Then... much like the Mojave before the Bear... tribes, towns, clutching to life. Bull did a better job.
AAD00101196	Denver? What's that?
AAD00101197	[SUCCEEDED] Mojave and the Divide aren't the only places I've walked.
AAD00101198	"Denver hounds?" Denver's far to the East - Legion territory.
AAD00101199	[FAILED] Another city fallen to nations, in the east... not important. Doubt you'll ever walk that far, you'd need the land to sustain you.
AAD00101200	[Legion] You've been to Denver? That's Legion territory.
AAD00101201	Mojave and the Divide aren't the only places I've walked.
AAD00101202	< Storage Node: Ulysses is discussing tunnelers and the future. Do not Translate. >
AAD00101203	They'll start emerging throughout the Mojave in time, might be years. Probably less.
AAD00101204	They breed fast, hunt in groups, more than enough to bring down the strongest in the Mojave. Once they draw blood...
AAD00101205	Seen them tear apart Deathclaws... Deathclaw might get some, but the rest will swarm it, tear it apart, like Denver hounds.
AAD00101206	I'm not interested in talking, I only want to know where to head next.
AAD00101207	What burrows below? You mean those creatures in the underpass?
AAD00101208	You've been to Denver? That's Legion territory.
AAD00101209	Mojave and the Divide aren't the only places I've walked.
AAD00101210	Maybe you should tell me what happened.
AAD00101211	And where the Bear tries to cling to life, the Legion comes... bearing messages. Some brought by blade. Others... by Couriers.
AAD00101212	You knew what was coming, as sure as I know what's coming for you.
AAD00101213	This time you carry the burden. Walk west into the sun, and keep walking until it dies. There - I'll be waiting.
AAD00101214	There is no other supply line to the Mojave beyond the Long 15.
AAD00101215	Not any more. If one existed, the two-headed Bear would have claimed it. And it tried to.
AAD00101216	You're still making assumptions about all this.
AAD00101217	No, recounting history.
AAD00101218	Whatever you believe happened, you have it wrong.
AAD00101219	Wrong? No, I know the truth of it.
AAD00101220	It was you walking that road that kept the Divide alive. It grew from what you did. Settlers... camps... filling that Old World city.
AAD00101221	Chance for a new nation, new beginning. New way of thinking.
AAD00101222	Could've breathed new life into the Mojave, bridging East, West. Like Hoover Dam... but not Old World, something you made. Road was a supply line.
AAD00101223	You're crazy. Your head's messed up worse than the Divide.
AAD00101224	And you've forgotten. Forgotten everything. Careless, as careless with futures then as you are now in the Mojave.
AAD00101225	I've walked a lot of hard roads, Mojave and before. Doesn't mean anything.
AAD00101226	It means everything - even if you deny it, cast it aside, that speaks to what you are, proves what happened here.
AAD00101227	< Placeholder Node: Ulysses talking about the Divide history. Do Not Translate >
AAD00101228	Never would have known the Divide had it not been for you. The road you made with your tracks, again and again.
AAD00101229	You were the only one willing to make the journey to and from here... a hard road. Kept the land before the Divide alive through seasons, storms...
AAD00101230	...can't have been just a job. Was something more to you. Don't feel for a place that hard unless it's home.
AAD00101231	You keep saying that, as if you know where I was born - you don't.
AAD00101232	Home isn't where you're born into this world. You taught me that. Part of your message, whether you meant it or not.
AAD00101233	Can be a place of mind, a moment where you know who you are, the history of it. And they can be places you breathe life into.
AAD00101234	I've never been here before, at least not from this road.
AAD00101235	Whatever they were carrying, they were fighting side by side with the ones in Legion armor.
AAD00101236	I'm not done talking to you yet, there's more I want to know.
AAD00101237	Already heard you once, long ago and loud enough for history to hear. Tired of your messages.
AAD00101238	Still - curiosity drove you this far. Let's see what else it can do.
AAD00101239	You wanted me to come to the Divide, I'm here. Now what?
AAD00101240	Your road's not done. Haven't walked it full yet, not nearly enough.
AAD00101241	I've had enough of this - whatever your game, I'm done.
AAD00101242	No, you are. Cut off your retreat, your supply line. Ashton missile, turned Hopeville into a furnace.
AAD00101243	You could walk back. Still can - but the Divide will mark you, sickness will set in.
AAD00101244	Not immediate, maybe, but in time. Slow burn, a little faster than before.
AAD00101245	The way ahead and below - leads to the heart of the Divide.
AAD00101246	And there... you and I, we'll have an ending to things.
AAD00101247	I didn't intend to set off that missile over the Divide.
AAD00101248	I had no idea the silo was active until the missile was in the air toward Hopeville.
AAD00101249	Didn't stop you, though. Like carrying the Chip to Vegas, Old World death in your hand.
AAD00101250	Pieces of the Old World like that just need someone careless enough to take them where they need to go, to do their killing.
AAD00101251	I don't understand how a package could have done this.
AAD00101252	You will. I'll show the Mojave, Bear and Bull the way of it. How Couriers can break nations.
AAD00101253	What happened here... can happen again. You've already proved it, what you did in Ashton. The silo there.
AAD00101254	You can't be sure it was me.
AAD00101255	No... I'm certain. What I hadn't known was that you still lived after the Divide.
AAD00101256	I'm not responsible for this, there's no way I could have known.
AAD00101257	If you had been there when it happened. If you had seen the Divide break, you would know it.
AAD00101258	You carry death wherever you go - if the Mojave doesn't know it yet, it will.
AAD00101259	I've been West, it's possible, but...
AAD00101260	This package... I don't recall it.
AAD00101261	It was from the West. From deep in NCR. Whether made by them or not... it came here. Through your hands.
AAD00101262	You said I brought it from the West?
AAD00101263	It was a device, a detonator. One I'd never seen before - or heard before.
AAD00101264	You carried that thing to the Divide. I know because I followed you as you walked the road, watched you do it.
AAD00101265	You brought it here, to the community you built. And you are responsible for what happened after - when the device opened, started to speak.
AAD00101266	When it did, the Divide answered back. Those missiles you've seen, buried in their silos.
AAD00101267	They exploded beneath the ground, cracked the landscape. Sand, ash... the dead... the Divide skies became a graveyard.
AAD00101268	I had nothing to do with this.
AAD00101269	The logs of the Big Empty mentioned you'd spoken to history.
AAD00101270	I had, did. It was madness... asked them a question in anger. Got an answer, more than I expected.
AAD00101271	Answer told me what happened here at the Divide, the how of it, and that was enough.
AAD00101272	The tape has the telling of it, don't need me adding to the questions already there.
AAD00101273	In the logs... you mentioned a tribe called the Twisted Hairs - your tribe?
AAD00101274	Twisted Hairs are dead, lost at Dry Wells, died in Vulpes' smile. Won't discuss their fate with you, not now - their past is mine to keep.
AAD00101275	Walk farther, see me face to face - you might earn more. Now, let the words keep you without me adding to them.
AAD00101276	I found some recordings from you on the road.
AAD00101277	The tapes... didn't think those would be found... weren't worth the words anyway, not like I'd forget what happened.
AAD00101278	Had the tech from the Big Empty, recorder a woman gave me... on its last legs, didn't survive the road. Cast it and the tapes aside.
AAD00101279	If you heard them... they're of no consequence. Ramblings, reminders for a man who doesn't need them.
AAD00101280	How were you planning to attack the Divide?
AAD00101281	Didn't know, but Couriers can travel anywhere. They make roads into places no one else will go, guarded or not. Was going to watch, see.
AAD00101282	The Legion... thought it might get into the community through me, just as I'd found the way by following you.
AAD00101283	But you struck first, shattered the ground, and let your home burn instead. Nearly killed me. And everyone here, walking or still.
AAD00101284	So the Legion doesn't know what happened here?
AAD00101285	No, they don't know the history of it. So send others to find out, more to die... at the hands of their brothers the Divide has claimed.
AAD00101286	It doesn't matter, the Bear's reach was cut off. Now only the Long 15 remains. Once that's finished, Mojave will be under the flag of the Bull.
AAD00101287	You were planning to attack the NCR here, then.
AAD00101288	I'm not interested in the history of this, we're done talking.
AAD00101289	All right. Done with words, then, won't get you where you need to go.
AAD00101290	So what happened?
AAD00101291	Bear made its shadow felt here, more than I could handle. Heavy guard, watchful. I watched, waited.
AAD00101292	And as I watched, studied the people. The flag, markings. Thought perhaps... if I got rid of the Bear... what you had given life to might come again.
AAD00101293	Waited too long. Hesitated. A Courier isn't meant to stay in one place for long. And then you came, with the package. History.
AAD00101294	This is the first I've heard of Legion coming this far West of the Colorado.
AAD00101295	No, when they come this far, they aren't Legion. They walk as Couriers. Like we do.
AAD00101296	And the Divide is the reason no Legion has been seen. None belong to Caesar. Not in this place.
AAD00101297	The ones that came... were following orders.
AAD00101298	So you are part of the Legion. One of their scouts? Assassins?
AAD00101299	Assassin? If killing needs to be done, I'll face my victims... not kill from a distance, like you.
AAD00101300	That's what made the Legion come to the Divide.
AAD00101301	On the High Road, you mentioned NCR and Legion fought here... before and after the Divide?
AAD00101302	The two-headed Bear made its claim, dug its claws into the trail you made. For once, it seemed like it might succeed - cut a route to the Mojave.
AAD00101303	Couldn't let NCR stay in the Divide. Trade route, road the military could use... can't have two roads into the Mojave.
AAD00101304	Not after the work we'd done to cut off New Canaan, other routes, killing caravans... all we'd done to make the West bleed.
AAD00101305	There's nothing to keep me from walking out of here and letting you rot.
AAD00101306	Spent years looking for you. If you head back to the Mojave, it's like nothing's changed. Can live with that. Had to.
AAD00101307	Wasn't sure if history would matter to you. If it doesn't, that answers my question.
AAD00101308	If you turn your back on your home, so be it. I'll remain here in the Divide for you to return. And you will.
AAD00101309	I'm not to blame for Ashton, the Chip, or the Divide.
AAD00101310	All these roads, you walked. These packages you carried. Think it wasn't your choice?
AAD00101311	Of course it was your choice. You could have stayed in the Mojave. But you chose to come, couldn't let be - not in you to let go.
AAD00101312	Came for no other reason than you were curious, restless - always have been. Had to know the why of it - now, I'll show you.
AAD00101313	I got your final message.
AAD00101314	Had to speak of it, in case the words got lost in paper, ink, or other's voices. Maybe even yours, in time.
AAD00101315	Still, meant for you. Courier to Courier. Belongs to you now, or history. Doesn't matter.
AAD00101316	I found some recordings from you in Hopeville.
AAD00101317	The tapes... didn't think those would be found... you know the Divide better than I thought.
AAD00101318	Had tech from the Big Empty, recorder a woman gave me... didn't survive the road, on its last legs.
AAD00101319	Cast it and the tapes aside... weren't worth the words anyway, not like I'd forget what happened.
AAD00101320	If you heard them... nothing but ramblings, reminders for a man who doesn't need them. Probably more, lying from here to the Divide.
AAD00101321	When we first spoke in Hopeville, you mentioned you'd sworn not to kill me. Why?
AAD00101322	You know the why of it. If you don't - I do, and that's enough. Shows trust only walks so far West.
AAD00101323	Earned more than that, though, getting this far. We walk the same road, carry the same colors. Can't break that by making the road red.
AAD00101324	Want more than that, walk the Divide. Answers'll come, closer you get to home... you and that machine.
AAD00101325	So... what, they weren't that important then?
AAD00101326	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe not. Who's to say.
AAD00101327	You, perhaps. Found them, heard them after I cast them aside - maybe there was purpose in that.
AAD00101328	If they matter... if history matters... we'll see at the end of the road.
AAD00101329	You wouldn't have recorded those messages if they didn't matter to you.
AAD00101330	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
AAD00101331	I found more recordings from you on the road.
AAD00101332	You scavenge words. Things I have no need of, no history there worth recounting.
AAD00101333	Scour the Divide, claw at it for meaning - but my words will give you no answer.
AAD00101334	I... think they tell me... where you were. Things you did.
AAD00101335	[SUCCEEDED] They won't help you understand what happened here.
AAD00101336	And they won't help you understand me. Keep them, listen, study them - they won't help you here in the Divide.
AAD00101337	No, there's a pattern. The more I hear, the more I understand your history.
AAD00101338	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
AAD00101339	So... what, they weren't that important then?
AAD00101340	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe not. Who's to say.
AAD00101341	You, perhaps. Found them, heard them after I cast them aside - maybe there was purpose in that.
AAD00101342	If they matter... if history matters... we'll see at the end of the road.
AAD00101343	You wouldn't have recorded those messages if they didn't matter to you.
AAD00101344	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
AAD00101345	You're going after the Long 15? That's more miles than Legion can hold.
AAD00101346	Won't hold it. Divide taught me you don't need to - just cut it off.
AAD00101347	Then the Mojave will fall, Bear will starve, its flag will burn. It's spent too long dying, the Long 15 will end it.
AAD00101348	What do you mean, "when it woke?"
AAD00101349	Machine couldn't speak by itself. Needed a terminal to access it... like the terminals in the silos here, or the machine with you.
AAD00101350	When it was connected, it started speaking. And the Divide answered.
AAD00101351	But what was it?
AAD00101352	It was a piece of machinery... military, holding memories, codes, maybe. When it woke, made these sounds... words.
AAD00101353	When it spoke, the Divide became fire, the ground... tore apart like the skies. Through it all, kept calling out - maybe calling for home.
AAD00101354	I don't understand why you didn't kill me in Primm.
AAD00101355	Promises to keep. 'Courier shall not kill Courier.' Always - let them live, spread the word.
AAD00101356	[Legion] You didn't kill me in Primm because you still thought I was Legion.
AAD00101357	Caesar's orders. Some time before I realized the why of it. Wasn't just you. All couriers.
AAD00101358	No telling how many were Legion. Maybe all of them.
AAD00101359	Wasn't sure about you. Until the Divide... all the NCR burning... that much death, it bears the mark of a Legion hand.
AAD00101360	But you killed like NCR. Like Hanlon, with mines, bombs... missiles. Killed Legion along with the Bear. Like a coward, kills from a distance.
AAD00101361	If you were Legion, then NCR beat you, the West changed you.
AAD00101362	You said you made a promise not to kill me. Why?
AAD00101363	Promises to keep. 'Courier shall not kill Courier.' Always - let them live, spread the word.
AAD00101364	What's our history? How do you know me?
AAD00101365	I knew of you, your name. Your road, to and from the Divide, what that meant for the Legion.
AAD00101366	We never spoke, knew you through your actions. Knew you'd walked the West as I'd walked the East. Learned different lessons.
AAD00101367	And I would never have discovered the Divide without you.
AAD00101368	I want to know more about this package I delivered.
AAD00101369	You know what it was. Had the symbols of America on it. New markings. From after the Great War.
AAD00101370	Thought it might be America come again. Promise of another future. Another flag.
AAD00101371	Before I go any farther, I deserve some answers.
AAD00101372	You've seen the Divide, walked it - farther than I thought you would. Not sure how much farther you have in you.
AAD00101373	If you need answers, speak. You've earned them... even if only you and I can carry them from here.
AAD00101374	If I have the answers, you've earned them.
AAD00101375	There's more I need to know.
AAD00101376	I... think they tell me... where you were. Things you did.
AAD00101377	[SUCCEEDED] They won't help you understand what happened here.
AAD00101378	And they won't help you understand me. Keep them, listen, study them - they won't help you here in the Divide.
AAD00101379	I've been collecting them. Listen to you talk about history enough, maybe I'll understand.
AAD00101380	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
AAD00101381	So... what, they weren't that important then?
AAD00101382	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe not. Who's to say.
AAD00101383	You, perhaps. Found them, heard them after I cast them aside - maybe there was purpose in that.
AAD00101384	If they matter... if history matters... we'll see at the end of the road.
AAD00101385	You wouldn't have recorded those messages if they didn't matter to you.
AAD00101386	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
AAD00101387	I found some recordings from you on the road.
AAD00101388	The tapes... didn't think those would be found... weren't worth the words anyway, not like I'd forget what happened.
AAD00101389	Had the tech from the Big Empty, recorder a woman gave me... on its last legs, didn't survive the road. Cast it and the tapes aside.
AAD00101390	If you heard them... they're of no consequence. Ramblings, reminders for a man who doesn't need them.
AAD00101391	You scavenge words. Things I have no need of, no history there worth recounting.
AAD00101392	Scour the Divide, claw at it for meaning - but my words will give you no answer.
AAD00101393	I want to talk more about your recordings I found here in the Divide.
AAD00101394	I was never a Legion agent.
AAD00101395	I know that now. Doesn't change what was done. The Legion who died here.
AAD00101396	Even if you were Legion, you would answer for those deaths by Caesar's law.
AAD00101397	I haven't listened to them all. If there's time, I will.
AAD00101398	As I said before... it's of no consequence. Never intended you to find them, never intended you to hear them.
AAD00101399	Questions in those tapes I still haven't found answers to. You won't be the one to give them.
AAD00101400	Then you learned the wrong message.
AAD00101401	Really. Who's to say the truth of it. You? No. You walked from this, turned your back on it. Now you and others will answer for it.
AAD00101402	I'll start with the West. Let that burn. Then... if the East falters after, I'll bring the Divide there as well.
AAD00101403	Burn away the flags. Begin again.
AAD00101404	You might not believe in nations. I do.
AAD00101405	[SUCCEEDED] Your actions have carried strength.
AAD00101406	[NCR] Even if you have no faith in the NCR, I do. My actions have proven it.
AAD00101407	[SUCCEEDED] There is conviction in your words, enough to rival a Legate, perhaps Caesar. You believe what you say.
AAD00101408	[Legion] The Legion is stronger than you know. If you would judge them, hear me first.
AAD00101409	[SUCCEEDED] Your actions have carried strength. More importantly, not for House, but for the families on the Strip.
AAD00101410	[Vegas] Even if you have no faith in Vegas, I do... and my actions have proven it.
AAD00101411	[FAILED] Words are not enough to bear the weight of your flag - if you follow anything at all.
AAD00101412	Speeches are things of NCR, words without strength. Your actions have shown nothing. Your flag will burn. The Mojave will follow.
AAD00101413	[NCR] You might not believe in nations. I do.
AAD00101414	[FAILED] You came from the West, walked there. You carry its sickness East to the Legion - and do not believe their cause enough to honor them.
AAD00101415	What I give the Legion is a swifter death than the disease you bring. You have not the strength to bear a Legion standard.
AAD00101416	[Legion] You might not believe in nations. I do.
AAD00101417	[FAILED] You serve Vegas ghosts, not the tribes Vegas devoured. House is not the people of Vegas - you have walked the Strip, yet have seen nothing.
AAD00101418	Your carelessness for the paths you walk - it has destroyed the city you serve. NCR will burn. Then the walls of Vegas will follow.
AAD00101419	[Vegas] You might not believe in nations. I do.
AAD00101420	[FAILED] Yet you follow nothing at all.
AAD00101421	You have walked the Mojave, let the shadow of flags fall upon you, yet walk carelessly, no allegiance. Your words - empty as your actions.
AAD00101422	[Rep] You might not believe in nations. I do.
AAD00101423	If you speak for the two-headed Bear, I'll hear your words. Even if I will be the only one to hear them.
AAD00101424	If you believe it should not die this day... then answer me why.
AAD00101425	If you feel I do not know the Legion's strength - then I will listen.
AAD00101426	If the ghosts of Vegas have come from behind their wall to speak for the West, I'll hear their words.
AAD00101427	If you believe that Vegas does not deserve to die as the Bear does... then answer me why.
AAD00101428	What makes you think this leads home?
AAD00101429	All roads lead back to one's home. Not your birthplace maybe, but home.
AAD00101430	This road leads nowhere. There's nothing in the Divide.
AAD00101431	Many in the Mojave think the Divide's nothing but canyon and storm. Wasn't always.
AAD00101432	There was life, a town, farther West... not talking about an Old World town like Hopeville... more recent. Something you saw in your lifetime.
AAD00101433	It had the name "the Divide," too. But rather than cracks in the earth, it was a road from the West into the Mojave, a supply line.
AAD00101434	Took a Courier to make that road. You. Back then, you saw the road with eyes facing East. This time... the Divide's in the other direction.
AAD00101435	And if your eyes try to make sense of it when you reach it... home's not what it was.
AAD00101436	You're not taking ED-E from me.
AAD00101437	If you think you can take it from me, try.
AAD00101438	The machine you brought is mine now, it's coming home. I'll reduce it to parts, just enough to function, to be aware of what's happening.
AAD00101439	ED-E's not going anywhere.
AAD00101440	What? ED-E?
AAD00101441	You gave it a name. What was it to you? Companion? Slave... weapon? All of that, nothing compared to its primary function.
AAD00101442	If you bomb the West and East... is this how things should end?
AAD00101443	[SUCCEEDED] History has proven this. Our history.
AAD00101444	You seek to use your own crimes to prevent mine. There... is a strange honor in that. Perhaps the shadow of the Bull does walk with you.
AAD00101445	The West, the East - they are not the Divide, and nothing you can do can prevent the missile's launch. Convincing me - changes nothing.
AAD00101446	There is no honor in murder from a distance, NCR or Legion. You know this from the Divide.
AAD00101447	[FAILED] You answer me with questions. Doubt. You were strong enough to come here - but not strong enough to speak for all the Legion.
AAD00101448	This is the ending they deserve... a flag is a thing of the people that gather to it, as are all symbols.
AAD00101449	You believe. Yet you do not see that killing a symbol with its own weapon carries justice of its own... just as it will when the East dies as well.
AAD00101450	Vegas earned its right to survive, its people don't deserve what's about to happen.
AAD00101451	[SUCCEEDED] History has proven this. Our history.
AAD00101452	And you think that you have this strength? Enough to hold up NCR, long enough so that Vegas may live again?
AAD00101453	Even if you speak for Vegas and its ghosts, nothing you can do can prevent the missile's launch. Convincing me - changes nothing.
AAD00101454	You told me once I gave life to the Divide. I can do it again, and give life to Vegas.
AAD00101455	[FAILED] No... your answer is not enough.
AAD00101456	They deserve what comes. Vegas is born of the corrupt, the  blind, lost, that gather to it. Without them... it would fall dark.
AAD00101457	You believe. Yet... you have been blinded by the wrong symbol. Let its light give you what strength it can... today marks its end.
AAD00101458	There still might be a way out of this - I just need time.
AAD00101459	We've already handled everything it can throw at us.
AAD00101460	The Divide? What do you mean?
AAD00101461	Our enemies gather outside... shadows of the Bear and Bull... they will have found their way in, just as you did.
AAD00101462	It was always my intention - in case I could not kill you, the Marked Men would flood this place, cut off your escape.
AAD00101463	If we cannot prevent what comes, then let us make our stand here. Two Couriers, together, at the Divide.
AAD00101464	Even if the missiles launch, and I die here  - if I can convince you, that's enough for me.
AAD00101465	It is... enough.
AAD00101466	I believe that one person can make... or break... a nation. You already know this.
AAD00101467	It may be... that as much destruction has been written in the earth here... you may build something else, as you built the Divide.
AAD00101468	You have spoken truly. There is a shadow of a nation behind you, the hope of a people... yet it may not matter. The Divide still stands against us.
AAD00101469	Well, I just said all that because I'm betting you have some way to stop all this.
AAD00101470	So... you resort to trickery. You were hoping that you could deceive me, reveal that somehow I can stop all this.
AAD00101471	Fire will rain on the West and the East, as intended, and the last words of the messenger of the Bull - nothing but lies.
AAD00101472	The West will burn, as intended, and Vegas will follow. The last words of its messenger, were not for the people of the city, but lies and deceit.
AAD00101473	Your nation will burn, as intended, and the last words of its messenger, were not for its people, but to beg for mercy.
AAD00101474	Because it should be given a chance? Its people don't deserve what's about to happen.
AAD00101475	[SUCCEEDED] History has proven this. Our history.
AAD00101476	And you think that you have this strength? Enough for all of NCR?
AAD00101477	The West is not the Divide, and nothing you can do can prevent the missile's launch. Convincing me - changes nothing.
AAD00101478	One can build a community, make it stronger. You saw it at the Divide, even blamed me for it.
AAD00101479	[FAILED] No... your answer is not enough.
AAD00101480	They deserve what comes... and should answer for it, as you should. The Bear is a thing of the people that gather to it, as are all symbols.
AAD00101481	You believe. Yet... you believe in the wrong symbol. Let it give you what strength it can... soon, it will be no more.
AAD00101482	Do you think I care if you fire missiles at NCR? Go ahead.
AAD00101483	You destroyed your own homeland. Seeing a nation burn? Didn't think that would matter any more to you.
AAD00101484	There's a strength in that... lack of attachment. Still, you're here now. If there's no more answers you want, then we'll end this.
AAD00101485	You can't destroy the West, even with all the missiles here.
AAD00101486	No need to destroy the Bear, just cut its throat.
AAD00101487	You taught me that at the Divide - only need to cut off the supply line, the road, to watch something greater die.
AAD00101488	I'll turn the Long 15 into miles of fire, cut off the Mojave. NCR will fall back, lose Hoover Dam... and leave their throats exposed to the Legion.
AAD00101489	< Topic Storage: End Sequence with Ulysses in Temple. Do not translate. >
AAD00101490	And knowing that you believe in the Bear's sickness and have given it strength... then that gives more reason to lay waste to your homeland.
AAD00101491	The sickness of the Bear already lies within you, even if you uphold the East. If there were time, I would let you kill the Legion.
AAD00101492	But no, the Legion will burn as well. Without the West to challenge it... its shore will be closer than before. It will feed on itself, die.
AAD00101493	Without NCR to support it, Vegas will fall to the Legion. That grave of lights, back to dust and ghosts, as was meant.
AAD00101494	After this, only one flag will remain over the Mojave. Let that one fly, or destroy itself.
AAD00101495	You don't see, listen - even when it's all around you, no matter if I nailed it into your head like a gift from Caesar.
AAD00101496	You brought the Divide to life, Courier. You walked the road. Brought the Bear, then the Bull, brought me, following your tracks.
AAD00101497	And when I saw the Divide you made, I saw a second chance, a new way of thinking. My world - no longer the East.
AAD00101498	Then you brought the West in that package. Destroyed it all. Nearly killed me, flesh and spirit.
AAD00101499	You destroyed something larger than the Bear, greater than the Bull. And even when you could have turned away, you brought it again, in that machine.
AAD00101500	You destroyed a nation taking its first breath. A place that could have been my home. Now, I'll destroy yours.
AAD00101501	This is between you and me, not anyone else.
AAD00101502	No... the paths we've walked. The roads, and the flags above them, carry equal blame.
AAD00101503	So, what - you intend to bomb the Mojave?
AAD00101504	No, the West. The East. It doesn't matter - the death of either one kills the other, Vegas along with it. The West shall answer first.
AAD00101505	No, not the Mojave. The West, all that's been built since America died. Same symbols as before the war, now a flag carried by a tribe of children.
AAD00101506	You walked the West, didn't stay. You know the reason... the Bear grows without structure, follows a symbol without knowing its history.
AAD00101507	What happened at the Divide, what I did, was an accident. What you're doing - it's madness.
AAD00101508	No, now there is purpose. I believe you when you say you were... careless. The Divide... the Chip... the machine you brought here...
AAD00101509	Many messages can be taken from that, intended or not. What I do now is an act of conviction.
AAD00101510	If you blame me for the Divide, then let me answer for it, not others.
AAD00101511	Blame you? No, learned from you. Both the weapon to kill a nation, and the strength to do it.
AAD00101512	You showed me a road, a way to carry my message. You've already answered for what you've done. Now the flag you follow will answer for it.
AAD00101513	Where is the package now?
AAD00101514	Buried in the Divide. Part of it now.
AAD00101515	Wherever it is, it's been silent... if it spoke again, we'd know.
AAD00101516	Why would I have brought it here?
AAD00101517	I've walked the East. You've walked the West, more than I have.
AAD00101518	Circle Junction. Reno. Vault City. Word of you at Fort Aradesh... Fort Abandon. Even further West than that, Brahmin drives on the Big Circle.
AAD00101519	Whatever you saw out there, wasn't enough to make you stay. Maybe the markings on the package reminded you of the road home.
AAD00101520	This package... you said it had markings? What was it?
AAD00101521	Machinery. Simple on the outside, computer parts. Inside... more complicated.
AAD00101522	Was the only time I'd heard a machine speak in the Divide, the only machine with a voice.
AAD00101523	This is revenge for nearly killing you, then.
AAD00101524	Not the name I'd give it. Not the name the dead would give it.
AAD00101525	Soldiers of the Bear died here... Legion died, too, my brothers. Still dying, both of them, all around us.
AAD00101526	None of the people that lived here survived... yet all of the West and the East, they hold on as the Divide tears at them.
AAD00101527	Revenge isn't the message I have for you. More than that... Courier.
AAD00101528	So you blame me for this? An accident?
AAD00101529	Blame? Accident? The names you hang on this... Courier... you carry death wherever you go, Mojave knows - or will.
AAD00101530	I'll see you answer for this. The road doesn't end here, there's more to come, I swear to you.
AAD00101531	If you saw this happen, then how did you survive?
AAD00101532	Should've died there... but now that I know you live... the machines here... saved me. I was the only survivor, or thought I was.
AAD00101533	Your package, the message inside, awoke medical machines... close to the one that shadows you... began to build themselves, then others.
AAD00101534	They only take what parts they find in the Divide, never roam beyond it - can't even leave the silos without a human to shadow, like hounds.
AAD00101535	Maybe they saw the flag on my jacket, thought I was of America. If so, history saved me. A sign.
AAD00101536	This place was important to the Legion?
AAD00101537	Why did NCR want to keep the route open?
AAD00101538	What do you mean?
AAD00101539	The Dam. That Old World Wall.
AAD00101540	[NCR] NCR would have needed this supply line open to reinforce the Mojave - and Hoover Dam.
AAD00101541	The Dam. That Old World Wall.
AAD00101542	[Legion] The Legion would want to cut this road off if it had been a supply line to Hoover Dam.
AAD00101543	The Dam. That Old World Wall.
AAD00101544	The why of it. Hoover Dam.
AAD00101545	The Bear, NCR, couldn't be allowed to reach it easily. Long 15... Canaan... both bad enough.
AAD00101546	Kimball, Caesar, House... you'd think their whole world was that wall, cutting the Colorado. If I'd never laid eyes on it, never spoke of it...
AAD00101547	...but once found, it was all Caesar could see. That, and the flag beyond it, another symbol, big enough to challenge him.
AAD00101548	And the Divide, one of the roads to it - Legion was tasked with cutting that artery. If you can't kill the Bear in one stroke, bleed it, starve it.
AAD00101549	That kind of murder... it's what any of the Legion would have done. Now... the Divide belongs to history.
AAD00101550	Something wrong? You sound... mad... at my robot.
AAD00101551	[SUCCEEDED] Hate? No. There's nothing to hate in metal... steel, gold. Or platinum.
AAD00101552	Your machine... it's just a tool, made of wreckage of the Divide... all that was brought here.
AAD00101553	You have a lot of hate for the robot with me. I can hear it in your voice.
AAD00101554	[FAILED] When I speak in anger, Courier, you'll know it. Your machine? Worth no more hate than any other machine.
AAD00101555	So you're saying I walked this road once from another direction - from West to East. To home.
AAD00101556	I don't understand. What message?
AAD00101557	The nations of the Mojave. Cracked and broken as the Divide... its people, the same.
AAD00101558	I have walked at Caesar's command, across the East, into the West. Far enough to know Caesar's word did not drive me. Far enough to see the end.
AAD00101559	You've seen it. No Courier, whatever their flag can ignore it. Why you didn't stay in the West. Why you wandered.
AAD00101560	There is no future in the Bear or Bull. The Bear is diseased, barely clings to life.
AAD00101561	And the Bull... when the Legion reaches the sea, it will turn on itself and die.
AAD00101562	Killing one will end both. And you made me see how one could do it. Your ignorance, carelessness - can be used with a purpose.
AAD00101563	If this is why you're angry, you've seen nothing yet.
AAD00101564	So this is revenge, then. For destroying the Divide.
AAD00101565	And that's why you want me dead.
AAD00101566	My history isn't revenge, or hate. The road that brought us both here - isn't about that.
AAD00101567	It's about the message you carried. The one in that package, whether you knew it or not.
AAD00101568	The message that one can kill a nation. Can kill a symbol. And all that gather beneath its flag.
AAD00101569	I don't blame you for the Divide. I blame you for what you made me see.
AAD00101570	Now you will see what you brought to the Mojave, and that will be my message to you.
AAD00101571	All things come to an end. If you put faith in something outside yourself, tough.
AAD00101572	If you cared about the Divide, then I'm sorry for what happened here.
AAD00101573	So you believed in this place. What it once was.
AAD00101574	There was hope here, another chance. A new nation, stirring to life. A place I could have set my flag.
AAD00101575	Not the America of old. But something larger than the tribes of the East, something larger than the houses of the West. Something better.
AAD00101576	The Divide... could have bridged both, like Hoover Dam. Now like the Dam, it's too covered in blood to see what it could have been.
AAD00101577	You gave life to this place. I followed your road here, saw the Divide. You led me here, so that I could see.
AAD00101578	Then, you brought it to an end.
AAD00101579	I'm glad this place burned... obviously, it meant something to you, which makes it even better.
AAD00101580	You think I'm responsible for this. My question is what your tie to this place is.
AAD00101581	If you blame me for what happened here at the Divide - why do you care?
AAD00101582	The community that was once here... and the package you brought... both had markings of the Divide. Markings of America.
AAD00101583	You've seen the marks, the symbol. As early as the Hopeville silo, maybe. Carried it etched on your weapons.
AAD00101584	The Divide, its buildings, its people, were built around those same markings, surrounded them here...
AAD00101585	...markings like the flag on my back. When I followed your road to the Divide those years ago, I saw the symbol I wore all around me.
AAD00101586	An Old World symbol. Strong, to survive here - its people, strong. Outlast the Bear, outlast the Bull. Promise of something better.
AAD00101587	Caesar was right to want it dead. NCR was right to want to rake their claws in it.
AAD00101588	Seeing it... changed me, just as seeing Hoover Dam changed Caesar and the NCR.
AAD00101589	Seeing it end changed me, too.
AAD00101590	[Legion] Killing NCR, cutting off their supply line at the Divide serves Legion, as do we all.
AAD00101591	Serves the Legion?
AAD00101592	I carry no hatred for duty... if that's what this was. The Divide was more than that. Its people, more than that.
AAD00101593	If you're Legion, are you angry because I destroyed the Divide supply line instead of you?
AAD00101594	The supply line - the artery for the West? I have seen the blood of NCR at Legion hands many times.
AAD00101595	I carry no hatred for duty... if that's what this was. The Divide was more than that. Its people, more than that.
AAD00101596	Then what? Did the Divide explosion kill your family? Your wife - children?
AAD00101597	[Legion] The dead? You mean your brothers in the Legion - our brothers.
AAD00101598	The Legion who died here... they didn't deserve to die, like those that died in the fires of Boulder City... bombs, Hanlon's gifts.
AAD00101599	Their deaths were mercy compared to those who still walk. Any who die beneath the flag of the Bull... their death should be in battle.
AAD00101600	But no... the dead number more than my brothers.
AAD00101601	[NCR] The dead? You mean the Republic troops who were here?
AAD00101602	The soldiers of the Bear? They were dead already, their symbol... diseased. Deserved to die as my brothers did at Boulder City, mines, bombs.
AAD00101603	I carry nothing for them. Their deaths here were a mercy - compared to the ones that still walk the Divide.
AAD00101604	When you speak of the dead - you mean the Marked Men? The Legion and NCR?
AAD00101605	The soldiers of the Bear? They were dead already, their symbol... diseased. Deserved to die as my brothers did at Boulder City, mines, bombs.
AAD00101606	I carry nothing for them. Their deaths here were a mercy - compared to the ones that still walk the Divide.
AAD00101607	As for my brothers in the Legion... they deserved to die in battle, as do all beneath the flag of the Bull.
AAD00101608	But no... the dead number more than my brothers.
AAD00101609	The Divide explosion... what, did I kill your family? Your wife - children?
AAD00101610	My family? My tribe lives... its history? Died long ago, fell under the shadow of the Bull... consumed by another symbol.
AAD00101611	No, this isn't about family - or any common blood. It's blood shared by acts, not by chance.
AAD00101612	What happened here was an accident. Any anger you have, let it go.
AAD00101613	So you're angry because I accidentally brought an explosive to the Divide?
AAD00101614	Accident? Ignorance is a choice. The Chip - a choice.
AAD00101615	As for anger... it is what I carry for the dead, and all that come here.
AAD00101616	"The why of it?" You're the one who needs to answer that - why are you doing this?
AAD00101617	Want to hear the answer of it. Not just history's answer... your answer for what happened here.
AAD00101618	[Legion] I'll see that you answer for it.
AAD00101619	Then Legion kills Legion. Farther you walk from the flag of the Bull, the more West creeps into you.
AAD00101620	[Legion] I didn't side with the Legion until the Mojave.
AAD00101621	I know that now. Doesn't change what was done. The Legion who died here.
AAD00101622	Legion doesn't know your history. I do. They find out what happened here, how many of their own died... they'll want an answer.
AAD00101623	What's so important about him?
AAD00101624	What's inside that machine - that's all that mattered. All the machines here, made of wreckage from the Divide... and all that was brought here.
AAD00101625	Inside its frame, it carries the message you brought here... and it'll do what it was programmed to do: whatever it can to get home.
AAD00101626	The giants here will listen to it. I'll bring the Divide to your home, your nation. Let its flag burn, just like you let the Divide burn.
AAD00101627	Big Mountain access code... Ulysses. Command override...
AAD00101628	Navarro.
AAD00101629	You want the robot? Why?
AAD00101630	It's a messenger. Like us... and it shares our history.
AAD00101631	If you feel its loss... remember you could have turned away at any time. Gone back home, and none of this would have happened.
AAD00101632	But you had to make one last delivery, and that's why I knew you'd come, Courier. Couldn't stay away, it's who you are.
AAD00101633	Maybe there's something similar to be said about that Old World flag on your back.
AAD00101634	No, what it means is that what pieces survive can become worse than they were before.
AAD00101635	It's proof that killing a symbol is going to be harder than you thought.
AAD00101636	Back to symbols and history, then. Hard to kill... like Couriers.
AAD00101637	You're saying when the meaning gets lost - that what happens here, can make things worse. Happened in the Mojave. Flags of the Bear and Bull.
AAD00101638	So you carry two symbols then - the mark of America and the Twisted Hairs, neither dead.
AAD00101639	Both... both survived, pieces of them. Remnants, nothing more.
AAD00101640	But the Twisted Hairs survived, even after Caesar.
AAD00101641	No, they didn't. They were ended, completely. Became part of history's march.
AAD00101642	If you feel there is meaning in the White Legs taking the braids of my tribe... what they did... insult, not respect.
AAD00101643	In the death of that history, another was born, and you grew to respect the White Legs.
AAD00101644	Respect the White Legs? That tribe of jackals? Never.
AAD00101645	In the log, you said they were shadows, in the way they wore their hair.
AAD00101646	The braids I wore. They took that from me, thought it made them more like me, more willing to have Caesar listen.
AAD00101647	They didn't know what the braids meant, the mark of my tribe before Caesar came... before Vulpes came for them at Dry Wells.
AAD00101648	There was death in that meeting, even while Vulpes smiled - asked for our help against the other tribes.
AAD00101649	All the while, they were looking to cast our history on the fire. And did. Another tribe, consumed by the Bull - nothing left.
AAD00101650	You're wrong, and you led them to destroy your tribe at New Canaan.
AAD00101651	I'm talking about the past, in the respect they showed you.
AAD00101652	Respect...?
AAD00101653	The White Legs might as well have been your people.
AAD00101654	The White Legs? To even claim they were shadows of the Twisted Hairs...
AAD00101655	No, whatever words you heard, they were not mine.
AAD00101656	But your tribe was New Canaan.
AAD00101657	New Canaan? My tribe?
AAD00101658	Any symbol deserves a chance to defend itself, by words or acts - not... this.
AAD00101659	As you defend it now?
AAD00101660	It hasn't proven itself wrong. That's why the Legion and NCR conflict must continue. To test it.
AAD00101661	Test it. As you test me? As if you believe there is some other road here.
AAD00101662	Nothing can prevent what comes. The missiles will launch. These questions - your words, or mine - what do they matter to you.
AAD00101663	By your standards? Or history's?
AAD00101664	Both. Why do you care.
AAD00101665	You said in the logs yourself that technology's a dead road. These missiles will solve nothing.
AAD00101666	Those are my words. After what happened with the Brotherhood... talking with them.
AAD00101667	Then with the rulers of the Big Empty. But it is their philosophy that was flawed - their weapons, used with new perspective...
AAD00101668	Those weapons can be used to kill a symbol that has already proven itself wrong.
AAD00101669	If you believe the destruction of the Divide was just, then I cannot stop you.
AAD00101670	Just? There was no justice in it, it was an act of carelessness, a coward. Killing an idea, before it had a chance...
AAD00101671	I see your meaning. You're tying this to our history... but it is different. The symbol I destroy, it has already proven itself wrong.
AAD00101672	Do you really think these missiles can kill everyone?
AAD00101673	Kill them - no. The symbol they follow? Yes, as surely as you did at the Divide.
AAD00101674	The question reminded the ones you spoke to of their purpose, why they cared.
AAD00101675	I spoke those words in anger, and I did not expect an answer. All was lost... I thought it was the end.
AAD00101676	Past their graves of failed technology, they had cared about the flag they had followed... and the people beneath it. Even with them dead and gone.
AAD00101677	But there's no answer in that. I do this because I care, because I believe it must be done.
AAD00101678	You were trapped, needed to escape, and needed the distraction. It was the key.
AAD00101679	I never sought to escape. I went to them to get an answer or die.
AAD00101680	It was all you could say to prevent from being killed. That's what I'm hoping for here.
AAD00101681	When I asked that question, death was certain. I wasn't begging for mercy.
AAD00101682	When all seemed lost, you asked it even though you feared the answer.
AAD00101683	Fear? No. Anger.
AAD00101684	If you've heard my words and that's all you've taken from them, then I was right to cast them aside.
AAD00101685	If you ever had any ability to hear anything beyond your own footsteps... the Divide silenced it. Now, its voice will end you.
AAD00101686	In the logs of the White Legs, you mentioned your tribe, and its past.
AAD00101687	My tribe? That log... no, it concerned the White Legs, training them to kill. For Caesar.
AAD00101688	There is no meaning there beyond the road to New Canaan. The history of the murder of its people. And Caesar's past.
AAD00101689	"Who are you, who do not know your history?"
AAD00101690	That question... either you walked the Big Empty... you found the last of the holotapes.
AAD00101691	The words are mine. Whatever... "answer" you think they hold, you're wrong. It was a question, nothing more.
AAD00101692	I'll let your words answer it, from the tapes you left along the road to the Divide.
AAD00101693	My words? And what do my words teach you.
AAD00101694	< Topic Storage: Player mentions holotapes at end. Do not translate. >
AAD00101695	< Placeholder Node. Do Not Translate.>
AAD00101696	I still don't understand - why are you doing this?
AAD00101697	You've answered your own question. And you'll die with that question on your lips.
AAD00101698	I believe destroying the symbol is never the answer. Changing it - that's something else.
AAD00101699	It may be... that as much destruction has been written in the earth here...
AAD00101700	One buried this place, yet it lived on between us. One may build it again - build others. Your history has proven this, here.
AAD00101701	There is truth in your words. But even if there is hope in change... it may not matter. The Divide still stands against us.
AAD00101702	If you meant to kill me, you should have done it long ago.
AAD00101703	I believed in what I followed then. Kill no Courier, Caesar's words. I honored them.
AAD00101704	Other Couriers could have been Legion - like me. Now, our allegiances are reversed.
AAD00101705	[Legion] Being Frumentarii kept you from killing me in the past. You have no such defense now.
AAD00101706	Not if you believe in what you follow. Kill no Courier, Caesar's words. I honored them.
AAD00101707	Other Couriers could have been Legion - like me. The truth is, you serve nothing, believe nothing. Killing you... meaningless.
AAD00101708	I want you to die knowing you're wrong, and that's what history will remember.
AAD00101709	We fight over how we will be remembered, then.
AAD00101710	No danger there. You skipped past where you build the community, moved onto killing one.
AAD00101711	Nothing can prevent what comes. The missiles will launch. These questions - your words, or mine - what do they matter to you.
AAD00101712	Don't even suggest we're equals. You couldn't have done this without me bringing you what you need.
AAD00101713	You were tricked. Still, you take pride in it.
AAD00101714	Then stop this, you can't truly believe what you're doing.
AAD00101715	Look, just the fact we're talking should mean you don't want to do this.
AAD00101716	No. You are wrong. Words will not bridge this.
AAD00101717	The Divide survived in you. If it felt like something fighting for, you can rebuild it.
AAD00101718	Nothing can prevent what comes. The missiles will launch. These questions - your words, or mine - what do they matter to you.
AAD00101719	All you are is some echo of me, following my road, letting my history dictate yours.
AAD00101720	Moral ground? What I did by accident, you're doing with purpose.
AAD00101721	You're planning to kill a nation from a distance, just like NCR - just like you accused me of.
AAD00101722	What do I care for your perspective. You walk blindly, foolishly into death, your own and others.
AAD00101723	You do not rule my actions, and do not mistake my acts for yours.
AAD00101724	If one Courier built a community, seems to me you can do the same.
AAD00101725	You said a home is a place you breathe life into, a moment where you know who you are.
AAD00101726	There is truth in that. History has proven it.
AAD00101727	But Mojave's proof that no homeland is sacred... until the larger symbols are destroyed.
AAD00101728	Whatever is built, the Bear, Bull... even Vegas... will tear it apart, convert it, either with purpose, or by accident.
AAD00101729	"You can go home again, Courier." Not a message for me, for you.
AAD00101730	My home in the East, Dry Wells, is no more. It is part of the Legion.
AAD00101731	The only other home... the chance of a home... was what you built at the Divide. Then you destroyed it.
AAD00101732	Nothing more to say, I've already won. Everything you hate about me, you've become.
AAD00101733	If you seek to anger me, words won't be enough. Your moral ground is weak here in the Divide.
AAD00101734	I don't have anything beyond words to change your mind. If you won't listen, it's over.
AAD00101735	I don't think that's what's important here.
AAD00101736	[SUCCEEDED] Our history... the Divide. That history has been written, its lessons learned.
AAD00101737	There is nothing more to be dug from these cracks in the earth, no more fury to be torn from its sky.
AAD00101738	I'm not talking about NCR or the Legion, I'm talking about our history.
AAD00101739	[FAILED] If those are your last words, they are weak ones. Actions would have had more voice.
AAD00101740	There is nothing more to be said between us. No words of yours will change what is about to happen.
AAD00101741	The symbol you wear is dead, and you helped kill it. The question is - what will you do to fix it?
AAD00101742	I believe the missiles can't be stopped. If you believe me, though, we might get through this.
AAD00101743	If we must survive to carry its message... then that is what shall be done. I will not let America die here.
AAD00101744	But... it may not matter. Even if we lay down our weapons, the Divide... it still stands against us.
AAD00101745	You interrupted its journey West, trapped it. If any part of America survived, it's cut off now.
AAD00101746	The package I brought was from Navarro, the Divide scanned ED-E's logs from the Mojave.
AAD00101747	What do you seek to gain by telling me this. If you think that the symbol I wear is a weakness...
AAD00101748	The Eyebot was a courier, sent to the West, to make contact with the remnants of America.
AAD00101749	Its logs tell of a place where America survived... may still exist. And it's falling apart.
AAD00101750	You lie. There was only one message in the machine, only one message in the package you brought.
AAD00101751	The Divide bore the symbol of America... as did the package from Navarro. The origins of the machine is... of no importance.
AAD00101752	It has history inside it. The logs of what's left of "America."
AAD00101753	There is nothing inside the machine except the means to awaken the missiles in the Divide. That is its only message.
AAD00101754	If my words won't change your mind, what about the messages in the Eyebot?
AAD00101755	The machine made from the parts of Navarro? It had only one message in its core - to get home, at any cost.
AAD00101756	It echoes its master... and soon the missiles here will as well.
AAD00101757	At least I don't hide behind a machine like a coward.
AAD00101758	Machines... bombs, things of NCR, are your tools, not mine. When we meet, this machine won't keep me from you.
AAD00101759	Keep talking like that, I'll see you dead.
AAD00101760	You already tried once, won't give you another chance.
AAD00101761	Sounds like the idea of a woman in the Legion surprises you.
AAD00101762	You said "brothers" before. So - you're Legion, too.
AAD00101763	You mentioned "casting off my disguise?" What do you mean?
AAD00101764	I'm no traitor, and when I walk, I don't hide my presence.
AAD00101765	Legion wears many colors, East and West. You... maybe blinded by Vegas's light, or the promise of that Chip.
AAD00101766	Or maybe you walked so far West, the Bear's sickness crept into you. We'll see. Your offenses before Caesar, the least of the crimes here.
AAD00101767	[Legion] You said you'd sworn not to kill me. If you're Legion, why are we at odds?
AAD00101768	You struck first. Not just at me... at the Legion. Or so I thought. Not sure of the history of it now.
AAD00101769	Whatever flag you follow, or followed then... either way, you got too much of the Bear's sickness in you to live. Divide's proof of that.
AAD00101770	Want more than that, walk the road. Answers'll come, closer you get to home... you and that machine.
AAD00101771	[Legion] Legion doesn't kill Legion. Caesar's orders?
AAD00101772	What kind of world would this be if Courier killed Courier.
AAD00101773	You've got enough distance ahead of you - save your breath for the road, don't waste it on words.
AAD00101774	[Legion] Legion does not kill Legion - but you're not that anymore. I'm going to kill you.
AAD00101775	If that's all that drives you, it won't last. The Legion... it won't last either.
AAD00101776	[Legion] So... when you called me traitor in Hopeville, that title belongs to you.
AAD00101777	No, it is a title you earned. Legion or not, you have betrayed more than you know.
AAD00101778	[Legion] Seeing this place. It meant more to you than the Legion?
AAD00101779	Yes. And it did to you once, I'm sure of it.
AAD00101780	[Legion] Are you angry that this explosion undermined the Legion's plans? It was an accident.
AAD00101781	Accident? Ignorance is a choice. The Chip - a choice.
AAD00101782	As for anger... it is what I carry for the dead, and all that come here.
AAD00101783	[Legion] If I destroyed the NCR in this place, why do you care?
AAD00101784	Legion died here as well. What you did... that's not all that cuts at me.
AAD00101785	Is this how it must end between us? You followed the East once, you can do so again.
AAD00101786	I cannot go back. I wandered too far, far enough to know my home was lost to me.
AAD00101787	I could no more go back than you could return to the West. To NCR, and all its sickness.
AAD00101788	I don't care what happens to NCR, but I can't allow you to harm the Legion.
AAD00101789	Not all the East will burn. The Legion does not need to be destroyed, only... contained within new borders.
AAD00101790	After that, it will fall as any culture bred on war, on forward momentum. It will falter, collapse.
AAD00101791	I will start with their camp at Dry Wells... once my homeland. Justice of a sort.
AAD00101792	The Legion doesn't abide traitors. What made you turn from the East?
AAD00101793	Even after the road you've walked, you only see a traitor before you.
AAD00101794	I know one person can break a nation. Legion tests nations, strengthens them - let it do so.
AAD00101795	I'm heading back to the Mojave to settle some things.
AAD00101796	I'm heading back to the Mojave to settle some things.
