BID00086159	I've been leaving notes for them, and gifts. 
GID00086160	
GID00086161	They like the books. Started with stories but moved on to weapons manuals, medical books, practical stuff. 
GID00086162	
GID00086163	In the notes, well it's embarrassing, almost like those cards people used to give to each other, everything sweet and loving. I tell them to read and to learn and to make the most of their new home. I tell them that I'm giving them Zion as a gift to make up for all the sorrows of their lives so far and all the sorrows man has visited on man. I tell them to be kind to each other and modest. I tell them never to hurt each other but that if someone else comes along and tries to hurt them to strike back with righteous anger. Stuff like that. I sign every note "The Father," because well, just because.

GID00086166	Have I mentioned that I'm dying? 
GID00086167	
GID00086168	Mind's still sharp. Lungs are the problem. Might be cancer. Cough's been getting worse for months, finally there's blood in it. Getting harder to visit my little friends, breath's so short. 
GID00086169	
GID00086170	I've given away most of what I own. They'll find the rest in the caves when they get a little older.
GID00086171	
GID00086172	I don't want them to find me though. "The Father" is a broke-down old man? Disappointment.
GID00086173	
GID00086174	It's time. I don't want another birthday.

GID00086177	It's cold enough that I won't last long on the high mound up next to Red Gate. I think I've got enough breath left in me to make it. I'll just lie down and stare at the sky. Feels right.
GID00086178	
GID00086179	I hope they'll do well. I hope no harm comes to them, from within or without. Did my best to prepare them with the last few notes. Said something kind about each one of them, what makes each one special. Told them The Father was pleased by their kind natures and that it would be up to them to handle things on their own from now on, that I'd be silent but still watching and still caring. 
GID00086180	
GID00086181	Lying, then. Oh yes.
GID00086182	
GID00086183	Lied to you, Char. And Alex.  And Sylvie. Told you I'd be with you forever. But I wouldn't go back and unsay it once if I could. 
GID00086184	
GID00086185	What was the point of it all? So many failures. 
GID00086186	
GID00086187	But I never forgot your face. Or Little Nut's. Or (sorry) Sylvie's. They used to say that happened after a while but it never did for me. 
GID00086188	
GID00086189	Maybe the only point of all this living was to keep those pictures in my head going for as long as I could. It was the only life I could give you. Not a day went by without.
GID00086190	
GID00086191	It wasn't choice. I chose to die again and again. Just never did. Body had its own drive.
GID00086192	
GID00086193	Well, the little ones will need it. Species will need it if it's to continue. That blind drive onward. 
GID00086194	
GID00086195	I wish them well. It's been a gift to me, at the end of it all, to behold innocence. 
GID00086196	
GID00086197	Goodbye, Zion.
