GID00086809	Trail Log 9 of 43: Spider - Day 3
GID00086810	Jesus, my head hurts. Not sure what the fuck hit me, I think it was one of those two assholes, Jack or Bernie, probably Bernie. Didn't think they would actually try to kill me though.
GID00086811	I was just looking at that waterfall when the next thing I knew I was in the water trying not to drown. I managed to clamber onto a rock, I think they were still up there but I wasn't going to show myself or they would have finished me with a bullet. They soon went away as they probably thought I had drowned. Bernie thinks I can't swim cause I wouldn't go for a dip in Lake Mead when he did. I didn't bother telling him it was because of the Lakelurks.
GID00086812	Couldn't get back up the cliff to the others so I floated down steam until I found somewhere where I could pull myself out. There is a bridge up ahead, I'll get to there and work out what to do tomorrow, but I need rest first and sort out what kit I have. I've lost my rifle, but I think I can salvage my stealth boys.
GID00086813	Trail Log 10 of 43: Suzy - Day 4
GID00086814	The fucking Spider thing blew up again this morning. It was gonna happen.
GID00086815	After a lot of shouting and bullshit threats Jack and Bernie gave JD a mouthful and took off, said they knew a shorter route than the one we were following and would see us there, and get this; as long as we had the caps to pay their toll! Assholes!
GID00086816	I thought for a moment JD was gonna frag the pair of them, then Pinky said something to him and he just let them go. What the fuck is Pinky seeing that we're not? Fuck it, I don't care and I seriously doubt we will be paying any fucking toll to Jack and Bernie.
GID00086817	Trail Log 11 of 43: Nathan - Day 4
GID00086818	Spencer finally came clean about what Spider and him were up to.
GID00086819	They believed they knew the whereabouts of an unopened Vault and were considering about taking it on themselves, but Spencer has come to his senses. Just as well as JD already seemed to know about it, or at least know that Spencer knew about it. The fools should know better to keep such information to themselves and besides, not much stays secret around here.
GID00086820	Seems Zion is postponed for the moment.
GID00086821	Trail Log 12 of 43: Bernie - Day 4
GID00086822	Fuck those losers, we'll get to Zion before them anyway. Jack reckons this route by-passes a whole load of shit. I can trust Jack, not those other fuckers.
GID00086823	I don't know why they were all whinging about Spider anyway. That was so funny, Jack is still laughing about it. He dared me to do him, so I did. Rifle butted him so hard he never made a sound, then just chucked his sorry ass over the cliff. I was aiming for the rocks, but I think he went into the water. Doesn't matter, the dick couldn't swim anyway.
GID00086824	As for the rest fuck 'em all. JD comes across all mean and nasty but I could take him down if I wanted, he don't frighten me. As for that smart ass Pinky he makes me want to puke. Thinks he knows everything, well, you didn't know about this route, did you asshole?
GID00086825	Trail Log 13 of 43: Max - Day 5
GID00086826	I'm surprised we got past those raiders without a shot fired. It was a stroke of luck that Finger and Suzy knew one of them and organized passage and smart of JD to go through at dawn rather than the arranged time. By the time those doped up idiots had got themselves together we were already marching through and the look on that bitch in charge when JD thanked her for letting us through was priceless. There was fuck all she could do about us and she knew it, especially as JD was cradling 'Diplomacy' at the time. He dropped her some caps anyway. To oil the wheels and help her save face, in case we come back this way, he said.
GID00086827	I'm not saying they would have bushwhacked us as we went through but judging by all the crap lying around we wouldn't have been the first. Not sure if Finger or Suzy was in on it or not, JD sure kept them close.
GID00086828	Trail Log 14 of 43: Pinky - Day 5
GID00086829	I thought Ezra had lost it when I saw him in Westside. But he managed to sell us a skanky old map, Spider a Vault and Jason a treasure stash. You have to credit the old bastard, he's still got the touch when he's sober.
GID00086830	I wonder which of these are actually the real thing? I grilled him on it, as I did him some favors in the past.
GID00086831	I'll buy into the map, but he said to forget the vault. Why sell it to Spider and then tell me that? The best lies always have a veneer of truth but he seemed strangely reluctant to go into details.
GID00086832	I seriously doubt we are the first he has sold this to as well.
GID00086833	Trail Log 15 of 43: Spider - Day 5
GID00086834	What a night that was. I got up on the bridge and headed east. I ended up at some weird industrial place that was full of Super Mutants! If I hadn't salvaged those stealth boys I would have been fucked. I didn't stop, I kept on through the night as I need to catch up with the rest, but Jesus, what a journey. 
GID00086835	I managed to get out in the morning and not a moment too soon. I heard screaming coming back from the quarry, sounds like they have caught someone. I wasn't going to hang around so I pushed on through the next tunnel and ended up staring at a fucking Robot on the other side. Just as well I still had my copy of the map, it had the override code written on it. Boy, did I need that one.
GID00086836	I had a quick look at the road and it's blocked, so I guess it's another tunnel but I'm too strung out to carry on. I found this camp and crashed, my new robot friend can stand sentry for me.
GID00086837	Trail Log 16 of 43: Jack - Day 6
GID00086838	I gotta get out of here. Leave Bernie, he's fucked.
GID00086839	One of those green freaks told him to shut up so he gave it the finger and shouted 'eat me'. That's a really stupid thing to say to a super mutant. He was lucky that thing wasn't hungry and only took his arm for a snack.
GID00086840	I wish he would shut the fuck up and stop whining, he's got another one. Don't think he is going last much longer anyway, the mutant used a chainsaw and it made a hell of a mess. Don't think it was very sharp.
GID00086841	I need to get myself out and he would only slow me down. It was his fault we are in this mess anyway, he's the one who whacked Spider and through him off a cliff.
GID00086842	Need to get back to the others, tell them about Bernie, they will let me back. If I can just get out of here, I can work out where they are. Wait, that's an idea, maybe I can trade them in, tell the mutants where they are in exchange for them letting me go. That's a plan.
GID00086843	I think one is coming back, OK, let's put this plan to work.
GID00086844	Trail Log 17 of 43: Dr. Fent's Work Notes
GID00086845	One of the prisoners has offered some of his friends as part of a deal. I thought this was very good, so as I seem to keep losing things, I have decided to keep him in a box in case he comes up with another good deal.
GID00086846	As a gesture of goodwill I will also give his friend his arm back. Well, another arm as I eaten the first one. Fortunately I have plenty of spare parts.
GID00086847	Attaching an arm requires delicate micro surgery so I used my best blow torch, although the patient seemed to object. On considering his objections I agreed that we should go for the full upgrade complete with an extra arm and power steering and I also have a spare combustion engine. I think he agreed judging by the look on his face when I showed it to him. He simply asked where I was going to put it, so I told him.
GID00086848	The procedure did not start well as I couldn't find his gear box, despite having a good rummage around. After this I decided to give the patient a local anaesthetic. I knew that battery acid would come in useful.
GID00086849	I wonder if I can find any white wall tires? That would really cheer him up.
GID00086850	Trail Log 18 of 43: Linda - Day 6
GID00086851	I think I'm really losing it, I've used my last Jet, and I have to get another fix. 
GID00086852	I pulled sentry last night and I always hate that. Left me sat on a bar stool looking back the way we came, with one of the Copes, Joseph I think, guarding the other way. Those two worry me. I'm no shrink, but they are far too tightly wrapped. 
GID00086853	It was the early hours and I was singing to myself to keep awake. Fall asleep on sentry and JD would freak and he has a real nasty side to him. I always hear things in the dark anyway, but I swear I heard Spider calling to me. I'm not sure if I was asleep and dreaming or it was the drugs, or lack off, but I just ran back to the diner and kept watch from there. 
GID00086854	Only Beth saw me. She gave me a nasty look but she won't mention it. She understands, she knows what I'm going through.
GID00086855	I shouldn't have come, I should have stayed with Daniel, I really feel strung out. I'll have a word with JD, we have stuff that will put me just right.
GID00086856	Trail Log 19 of 43: Spider - Day 6
GID00086857	I'm finished.
GID00086858	Didn't know this place was full of ghouls until it was too late. Tried to sneak through but my last stealth boy gave up on me just when I needed it. I managed to escape them up here, but they can sense I'm still around, I can hear them looking.
GID00086859	I've tried to reach that grill to get out, but I just can't. There is something on it and I can't move it and I'm screwed. Ironic, I've screwed so many I guess it's my turn! Shit, shit, shit.
GID00086860	Are they in the corridor below?
GID00086861	I took a hit from one of them, a dose of radiation as well and I have no chem's so I'm starting to fade fast. My mind is starting to wander, I actually thought I heard Linda singing a moment ago. I even called out. The only thing that attracted was the ghouls.
GID00086862	I can hear them below. Fuck. I've got 5 rounds left. That's four of them I can take with me. Fuck.
GID00086863	Never could get near Bethany. What was her problem?
GID00086864	I think they are on the stairs.
GID00086865	How the fuck did I end up here? It's not fair, I never meant to hurt people, I was just having fun. Wasn't my fault that hooker believed me when I said I would get her out, I just didn't have the money to pay her. Not my fault they caught her with her bags packed...
GID00086866	They are at the top. I can see one.
GID00086867	Trail Log 20 of 43: JD - Day 7
GID00086868	Lost Suzy today. Sniper got her. No one saw it coming and she certainly didn't. She was probably stoned again, wandering off down the road like that. 
GID00086869	Joseph took down the Sniper as it didn't take him long to work out where he was, Joe's good like that. Not sure how the fucker got up there, Spencer wanted to go a loot the body but I told him to leave it, I don't want to waste time wandering around the mountains as there may be more of them and this is their turf.
GID00086870	It finished Finger, Suzy was the only real reason he was here. He just turned around and headed back, probably to those raiders at the bridge. I think he was still stewing about that incident, the fact I kept him in the dark about the move.
GID00086871	I let him go, I've had enough of junkies today. Linda's becoming a problem again, although I'll stick with her because she's useful. Finger would become a liability.
GID00086872	Trail Log 21 of 43: Jason - Day 7
GID00086873	Bastards, they think it's so funny. 10 caps, some moldy food and a single energy cell. I'm going to kill that fucking hobo.
GID00086874	Trail Log 22 of 43: Linda - Day 7
GID00086875	We have lost another. Nathan was killed when we clashed with some Viper gang as we were looking for the Vault, the two groups practically walked into each other.
GID00086876	It was pretty bloody and one sided as I think only one of them escaped but Nathan just got unlucky, it was just a single stray round. No one is even sure who fired it.
GID00086877	Oh shit, I think it was me. It was all so chaotic and quick and I have this really horrible feeling it could have come from me accidentally. I don't know, nothing's been said but there was nothing I could do for him, it was instant. The wound looks like a 10mm, that's what I carry.
GID00086878	Joseph took his body back to the church, says he needs to take care of him. Something about consecrated ground, a religious thing I think. No one tried to stop him. 
GID00086879	I really need another fix.
GID00086880	Trail Log 23 of 43: Joseph - Day 8
GID00086881	It's just you and me now, Nathan. The others have left and it doesn't surprise me. They don't understand. I told mother I would look after you and that's what I'm going to do. We are going to be fine, I'm not going to let anyone come near us, we are going to be OK.
GID00086882	Trail Log 24 of 43: Max - Day 8
GID00086883	We have had a quick scout around, there is a lot here still locked up. Was going to try and get in but JD said to hold off. Not sure why, but you don't argue with JD.
GID00086884	Beth managed to hack into the only working terminal. Couldn't get much out of it but it seems the security systems are still online and there is an awful lot of it just for a fucking train yard. Guess JD was right. 
GID00086885	I think the plan is to find a master terminal or a power source or something so we can shut the whole thing down.
GID00086886	Trail Log 25 of 43: JD - Day 9
GID00086887	Damn Pinky, he really pisses me off sometimes.
GID00086888	We found the Vault entrance! Vault 66. Still locked up tight. Result, now we just have to work out a way in. Yes that will be a tough one, a really tough one but the rewards could be huge. Then Pinky sticks his oar in.
GID00086889	He says leave it. Nothing good ever happened in a vault. Bad karma, conspiracy theory shit. Didn't give any specifics, rumors, stuff he has heard, fucking etc, etc...  And what did he mean about writing on the wall?
GID00086890	He's done this before.
GID00086891	And what sticks in my craw, what really fucking gets to me.... is that the old bastard is always right.
GID00086892	Trail Log 26 of 43: Beth - Day 9
GID00086893	Well that's really screwed it all up. JD decided to pull the plug and leave the Vault and go for Zion. Says the risks are too great.
GID00086894	Spencer lost it. Says he is crazy, it's the opportunity of a lifetime. And more importantly he is not giving up, he is staying with the vault and doesn't care what everyone else does.
GID00086895	All of us except Jason sided with JD, we have come this far and he has never let us down but even I am questioning this one. True, the security systems are still up and running and I haven't been able to get into them. But I'm sure some of the access gates can be opened, I just need to locate the electrical trip reset.
GID00086896	From what I've seen the Vault is still probably functional and might even be occupied. Could we not even try? JD says no, we are moving out. I'm taking some of the computer files with me anyway, maybe I can make sense of them later.
GID00086897	That's another two down, less than half of us left, the crew is breaking up.
GID00086898	Trail Log 27 of 43: Finger - Day 10
GID00086899	I'm back where I belong.
GID00086900	I was surprised to see Ris in this shit hole though, last time I saw her was in Vault 3. Maybe she pissed off Motor-Runner once too often. Anyway, she says I'm cool so the others have accepted me as they don't fuck with Ris.
GID00086901	I had enough of those other assholes anyway and JD never trusted me. Screw 'em.
GID00086902	Trail Log 28 of 43: Linda - Day 10
GID00086903	We talked to Joseph on the way out and he is staying is staying at the church. Those two were always strange but losing Nathan has pushed Joe over the edge, he has really lost it. He was quite aggressive with us.
GID00086904	Then again, maybe he knows.
GID00086905	Trail Log 29 of 43: Jason - Day 10
GID00086906	It seems we have been wandering around these tunnels for ages. We found this derelict service place and are camping here. We are not the first, someone has been here before us, nice of them to leave us this stuff. Talking of which, I sold my rebreather in Vegas and need another, I'll borrow Spencer's. He is out trying to find a way through these tunnels at the moment. He has a stealth boy as well, I'll borrow that too, I'm sure he won't mind.
GID00086907	Trail Log 30 of 43: Spencer - Day 11
GID00086908	I think Jason must be dead. On the way in through those damn tunnels one of the grills gave way and down he went. I managed to hang on to one of the pipes but Jason disappeared. I shouted down but could hear nothing.
GID00086909	I thought we were screwed when I came across that first service shaft, we were just lucky whoever was here before us left us a ladder which I managed to bridge the gap with. Jason asked what happened to him so I told him he had probably given up, which he seemed happy with. I really envied Jason sometimes, ignorance can be such a happy place. I reckon whoever it was is actually at the bottom of that shaft and now Jason is at the bottom of another. It's true what they say. Gravity really does suck.
GID00086910	I'll rest a while, then move on. And where the fuck is my rebreather? I might need that.
GID00086911	Trail Log 31 of 43: Spencer - Day 12
GID00086912	I exited out of some service hatch and into the Vault and it was all there and functioning! I told them! A fully functioning Vault! I checked the first rooms I came to, one was locked and the other, well, I can only assume raiders got here first. Fuck. It actually looked all a bit clinical for raiders but what other sick fuck would do this?
GID00086913	I managed to find my way up to this storage area, which wasn't easy as I must have lost my spare stealth boy down that shaft but then I came across those damn robots. I wasn't expecting them as I didn't think raiders used them but they got me. I managed to escape but I haven't got long, it doesn't hurt but I'm going cold. I guess JD was right about this place, but it must have been worth a shot. 
GID00086914	It's a fully functioning Vault and I got inside, yeah, that's me, the Vault expert. Guys, you should have trusted me. Together this would have worked.
GID00086915	Trail Log 32 of 43: Jason Corpse Note
GID00086916	You idiot Alan, I told you not to take too much. I liked that kid, he was one of my favorite blood groups and we could have strung him out for ages.
GID00086917	Anyway, see if you can find the kid's name, it was Jason I think, you know the Chef likes to give his dishes a name but tell him no curry this time. I want to be able to taste this one 'cause 'Melvin Madras' burnt my ass off. And see if there is any Chianti left.
GID00086918	Trail Log 33 of 43: Linda - Day 13
GID00086919	I'm still feeling rough, I've had a word with that trader to get me some stuff. He was a bit reluctant at first but I hit him with a load of medical jargon and won him around.
GID00086920	He was probably wondering why I didn't go to the Followers doctor, but Louise would probably recognize me and I couldn't deal with that. 
GID00086921	The others seem happy enough but I'm sure they are talking about me and the shooting back at the train yard. Deciding what to do.
GID00086922	Trail Log 34 of 43: Beth - Day 14
GID00086923	We walked into 'Rita's Cafe' 2 days ago and it's been a welcome break. A chance to rest, trade and re-supply.
GID00086924	From talking to the locals we are not that far off from Zion Park now, although it doesn't promise to be an easy journey. We have all talked about it and have decided to carry on, even though this 'unknown' road has turned out to be anything but. Everyone was in favor apart from Linda who doesn't seem to care one way or the other. She has been very quiet just recently.
GID00086925	We also asked about the Vault but nobody seems to know anything. JD reckons they are lying and actually know a whole lot about it, but for some reason don't want admit it. I wonder how Spencer and Jason are doing?
GID00086926	Talking of which, I've finally made some head way with one of those deleted computer files I dug out at the train yard. Its taken me a while because I assumed they were Vault related, but they were not. So what is Stone Case?  
GID00086927	We were planning to set out this morning, but we are running late so I'm not sure how far we will get today.
GID00086928	Trail Log 35 of 43: Pinky - Day 15
GID00086929	Linda died today. She had disappeared during the night and we found her this morning.
GID00086930	There were no wounds but she was lying face down in a pool of her own puke, surrounded by empty jet inhalers so it's a fair bet it was chem related.
GID00086931	Either an overdose or a bad chem batch, I'm not sure which. She must have got them from Rita's Cafe as JD has been keeping the heavy duty stuff himself.
GID00086932	This has hit us hard. Linda was popular when she was clean and a good medic, I guess she just had too many demons, but I really never thought she was this far gone. We should never have brought her.
GID00086933	And then there were four.
GID00086934	Trail Log 36 of 43: Max - Day 15
GID00086935	So this is Zion? Made good time today despite some Cazadores. We decide to camp at this old 'ranger' station. Never heard of a park ranger before, I wonder if they were as mean as NCR Rangers? We are going to head east down into the valley tomorrow.
GID00086936	Trail Log 37 of 43: Beth - Day 15
GID00086937	Cracked it! Stone Case, Access code: DH65-HJ2976. Almost there with the security code.
GID00086938	I think its a pre-War facility of sorts, but there's only a place name which I don't recognize. There's no coordinate data.
GID00086939	Trail Log 38 of 43: Max - Day 16
GID00086940	When we got down by the lake we realized there was some sort of tribal group there. I haven't seen anything like them before and they look pretty primitive.
GID00086941	JD's trying to talk to them, Seems they are going to lets us through.
GID00086942	Trail Log 39 of 43: Pinky - Day 16
GID00086943	It all went to hell when we went to pass those tribals, they tried to take us. It wasn't a total surprise, we were not that stupid, but they were everywhere. I reckon they must have been on to us before we camped yesterday.
GID00086944	One of them got lucky with a grenade, which went off amongst us, wounding all but me. JD then told me to get the others out while he held the fuckers off. You know, for all the years I've known John I never had him down as the hero type. 
GID00086945	I dragged them away until I realized we were in a dead end, so I left them there and went back, I should have stayed with John. I was too late to help him but he had gone down hard and I managed to finish off the rest. I might be an old bastard but I'm a mean old bastard. 
GID00086946	When I returned to the others Max was already dead and Beth was practically unconscious, concussion I think. I've buried John and Max, we need to rest, give Beth a chance to recover and let the meds kick in.
GID00086947	- Fuck, there are more of them appearing, we need to move, quick. It's still dark, maybe we can slip past, get back to Rita's Cafe
GID00086948	Trail Log 40 of 43: Pinky - Day 17
GID00086949	They got behind us and blocked off our way back to Rita's Cafe, Beth said to go this way but I'm not sure so I should have listened, I don't think she is really with it.
GID00086950	Now we are just running anywhere and we can't shake them off as we are hemmed in this bloody canyon. Almost out of ammo as well, so there is not much chance we can fight our way out of this. We just have to keep going.
GID00086951	Trail Log 41 of 43: Pinky - Day 18
GID00086952	I'm exhausted and so is the ammo. Guess this is the end, we gave it a good shot. I think Beth is hallucinating, she keeps saying we made it, poor kid.
GID00086953	Trail Log 42 of 43: Beth - Day 20
GID00086954	Pinky is still sleeping. The poor old bastard was all in, probably from dragging my sorry ass around.
GID00086955	My head is pounding and ears are still ringing a bit but we are safe now. Those tribals following us tried to get in as well but its not a mistake they will make again. I hope those robots are programmed to clear up the mess. 
GID00086956	When I saw it, it was almost too much to hope for but there it was. We found Stone Case. My habit of collecting old computer files and passwords has often paid dividends but never before on this scale. This time it really was a life saver and we have literally struck gold to boot. 
GID00086957	It is a pity we cannot share it with JD and Max, and Linda but if they were still alive we would probably would never have ended up here in the first place. I wonder what happened to the others?
GID00086958	Fate has been whimsical this journey.
GID00086959	Trail Log 43 of 43: Note
GID00086960	To whom it may concern:
GID00086961	Sorry, we beat you to it. We have already taken most of what was in here and we have left this one gold bar as we couldn't carry any more. We considered coming back for it so we reset the security systems as you will have noticed.
GID00086962	But, if you have made it this far you probably deserve this and we won't hold it against you for taking whatever's left.
GID00086963	Enjoy - Beth & Pinky
GID00086964	Note
GID00086965	Business seems to be picking up. I used to just get a few raiders and the odd prospector, but recently I've had some NCR, quite a few Vipers and it looks like there is another group up at the diner.
GID00086966	I'll pick out a tasty looking one, I'm going to start to put on weight if I'm not careful!
GID00086967	I'll go at dawn to wait for this lot, I couldn't make them all out last night and I need to check they are not with Angel, but I did see a man and a women shooting up and they look like Raiders to me. Should be easy. I'll leave the oven on.
GID00086968	Note
GID00086969	Happy birthday to me! 176 today! Mom and Dad would be proud.
GID00086970	Research Project: Vera-1
GID00086971	Frankly, this has been a disappointing start to my efforts to bring Vera Keyes to life once more, but the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, as they say.
GID00086972	By chance, I noted that one of the raider females at the bridge bore a surprising resemblance. It was at this point I first considered the possibility of bringing Vera back to life, in a manner of speaking, so I attempted to isolate the female in question and return it to my lab for further tests. 
GID00086973	The initial phase was successful with the application of the correct medication, which the subject was surprisingly happy to self-administer. However, once the medication started to wear off the subject became quite uncooperative and aggressive. I was forced to terminate the subject, which is something of a setback. Nevertheless, I have kept the subject's body in stasis in hope of still taking the project forward.
GID00086974	ADDENDUM:
GID00086975	I had noticed quite a foul odor emanating from my stasis pod, and upon further inspection it appears the female's body has begun to decompose. In truth, I am beginning to wonder if this device was, in fact, a "stasis pod" at all. I shall have to confront the individual I purchased it from and demand a refund. 
GID00086976	This further setback has probably put paid to Phase Vera-1. Undaunted, I shall move forward with Phase Vera-2 and a new approach.
GID00086977	Research Project: Vera-2
GID00086978	I have managed to obtain some research material and hardware alleged to be from the actual Sierra Madre thanks to my source in Hayford, although the price has been considerable. This may actually realize a recreation of Vera in holographic format, which should be far easier to manage as I will not have to resort to such barbarities as threats of violence to obtain her cooperation.
GID00086979	I have made good progress, but there are still an unfortunate number of difficulties which will need to be overcome.
GID00086980	First, the non-functional holographic projector allegedly from the Madre is the size of a small cooking pot, whereas my device would not fit in a kitchen. I need to source smaller components.
GID00086981	Second, the Madre's holoprojectors, from what information I have been able to glean, allowed the holograms emitted by them to freely move about an area the size of a large room, and even interact (!!!) with people and their surroundings. The hologram emitted by my jury-rigged version cannot move from within the actual confines of the projector aperture, and does not possess any kind of programming allowing it to interact with anyone or anything. And to be honest, she is a bit blotchy as well. This is dreadfully disappointing.
GID00086982	Research Project: Vera-3
GID00086983	A chance encounter in Hayford gave rise to an unplanned resurrection of the Vera-1 project. 
GID00086984	Again, this project has proven to be problematic as the subject is once more uncooperative, despite an initial assessment that promised otherwise.
GID00086985	This time however I shall be more patient and move things forward at a slower pace. To be more organized I have separated difficulties in a separate entries.
GID00086986	Research Project: Vera-3A
GID00086987	Issue 1: Subject does not behave like Vera.
GID00086988	Behavioral analysis of the female has revealed very few Vera-like attributes overall. I have attributed this down to lack of cooperation but have made some progress In the area from the subject by administering the following items:
GID00086989	Chems. This generally works quite well although the subject generally starts behaving much the same as the initial female and in effect, ceases to function. Irritating.
GID00086990	Alcohol. Can sometimes have the desired effect but can be unpredictable. Will not attempt again.
GID00086991	Caps. This by far produces the best results, but after the acquisition of the products from the Sierra Madre I have very little left. Again, irritating.
GID00086992	Research Project: Vera-3B
GID00086993	Second issue: Subject does not look like Vera.
GID00086994	Solution: A dress and wig have a surprisingly profound effect. Cannot be considered a permanent solution, although it seems to work reasonably well as long as I keep at least thirty yards away from the subject. Obviously, however, this defeats the entire purpose of the project.
GID00086995	Research Project: Vera-3C
GID00086996	Third issue: Subject does not sound like Vera.
GID00086997	The female does not have the same voice as Vera, and since becoming sober has expressed a number of colorful opinions about myself and my research. I am sure that Vera Keyes would not have made explicit comparisons between myself and the genitalia of a molerat, amongst a number of other statements whose meanings I am not aquianted with - though I am certain they are not flattering. 
GID00086998	A temporary solution is the same as the previous issue, except to increase the distance to fifty yards, as she can shout quite loudly. Again, defeating the project's entire purpose. I may have to get creative.
GID00086999	Vault 66 Overseer Log Entry 02
GID00087000	2084
GID00087001	The first test batch has begun on members of the subject group. I was a bit taken aback when I first heard about these vault experiments but once it sank in I was quite exited. This is cutting edge stuff.
GID00087002	I was a little disappointed when I found out what my vault was to do. Physiological studies. Longevity, increasing endurance, that kind of stuff. I had managed to sneak a peak at some other projects, experiments in psychology, sound, I thought I saw something about puppets somewhere, but I must have misread that. Ours seemed a bit tame by comparison, but at least I'm part of it, or supervising anyway. I not sure I would want to be one of those poor fools actually involved in it. Not until it's all proven safe anyway.
GID00087003	Vault 66 Overseer Log Entry 01
GID00087004	2081
GID00087005	We have been sealed in for a while now and its all pretty calm. We have heard nothing from the outside at all, not even any explosions. I guess the vault was built well. No communications at all though.
GID00087006	The experiments have been delayed, still some more background research to be done evidently. Dr. Nice, our resident chief scientist, is organising the details. He keeps to himself, a very driven man. A geneticist and one of the team involved in finding a cure for the New Plague I understand. Specializing in something called the Pan-Immunity Virion, whatever that is.
GID00087007	Vault 66 Overseer Log Entry 03
GID00087008	2088
GID00087009	The experiments have been going well, we have had some extremely good results but also some rather disturbing side effects. Skin problems, sensitivity to light and more. Some of the subjects are also demonstrating some strange behavioral patterns as well. Some quite disturbing, we have had to restrain one.
GID00087010	Dr. Nice seems to have it covered though, he has been treating them with some sort of blood product. Animal blood doesn't do it, has to be human but then isn't that what the control group is for? We just give them the biological warfare and faulty filters story to keep them on side.
GID00087011	Vault 66 Overseer Log Entry 04
GID00087012	2091
GID00087013	The security chief keeps insisting on recons outside the Vault. It's not in the Vault's operating instructions but there are conflicting orders from military directives. I want to stop this as it could endanger the experiment and I was hoping for some backing from Dr. Nice, but I think he is letting his curiosity get the better of him.
GID00087014	I'll work on the two of them, but I need to be careful with the chief as he is not actually fully informed to our primary directives. Army man, not Vault-Tec, he was a poor choice for the job.
GID00087015	Vault 66 Overseer Log Entry 05
GID00087016	2102
GID00087017	I don't believe it! A whole group of people have fled the Vault!
GID00087018	I knew something was going on but I didn't realise that there was that many involved. The White family, the Lewised, the Dunns, Susan Hicks, David Burgess, Michael Dolan, mostly the control group but not all. The Trapps went as well, although they were only just started on the 'treatment'.
GID00087019	They didn't have any problems breaching security as the chief, Andrew Poke, was one of them! No wonder I was in the dark about it, fucking traitor. I thought he was acting strange.
GID00087020	They won't last long outside though. There has been some petty pilfering from the stores but nothing to sustain them for long. 
GID00087021	This has really jeopardized the experiment and is causing all sorts of problems, we needed their blood. If we catch any of them I'm going to drain them personally.
GID00087022	Vault 66 Overseer Log Entry 06
GID00087023	2102
GID00087024	I authorized a patrol to go outside and check for the missing members, but not to go too far. They didn't find them, not that I was really expecting them to.
GID00087025	On the plus side they did pull in a couple of other locals. Sorry looking pair, didn't get much useful information out of them but plenty of blood. That will help.
GID00087026	Vault 66 Overseer Log Entry 07
GID00087027	2104
GID00087028	Things have been getting pretty bad around here. Some of the local 'livestock' we have been pulling in are keen drug users and this is causing Dr. Nice all sorts of problems. We have started to keep them in pens to 'dry' out but this takes time and not all survive.
GID00087029	What's more I have found out that some personnel have been actually eating them as well. What the hell is going on? There is no food shortage. Dr. Nice, surprisingly, wasn't at all shocked by this, just rambled on about side effects and hormones, but I know I didn't damn well authorize it. And what did he mean about 'known' side effects?
GID00087030	I'll talk to the new chief of security, for what it's worth. I found out a while ago that he was brought here by the Doctor and in all likelihood is his man. What a mess, I really need to sort these people out and re-assert my authority. This current state of affairs will not do.
GID00087031	Note from Ris
GID00087032	We are running a bit short on ammo again, so I'll have to send someone over to fucking Blue Ray to trade for some more. I would love to take that bastard down but he's the only place we can get ammo. Even Angel gets most of her stock there. Anyway, that house is a fucking bunker.
GID00087033	Maybe we should wait for Angel anyway, she'll put a markup on stuff, but every time I send one of these asshats over there, they go sniffing around and end up getting killed.
GID00087034	I wonder where Angel gets her pies from? Sure taste good.
GID00087035	Research project Vera-3D
GID00087036	Fourth issue: She does not smell like Vera.
GID00087037	I'm sure the original Vera did not smell like a Brahmin, although I cannot confirm this as I can find no information on Vera Keyes' aroma. This is surprising, as there is no end to the other sorts of esoteric information I have located about about her that was, evidently, collected by her male fans for perverse reasons.
GID00087038	The subject actually suggested a solution in the form of a bath, but I am loathe to take advice from a female, much less one without a scientific background. A temporary solution is the same as the previous issues - and yes, once again, defeating the entire purpose. To say I am frustrated would be an understatement. 
GID00087039	Research project Vera-3E
GID00087040	Fifth issue: Subject's name is not Vera.
GID00087041	I should have paid more attention when the subject initially approached me in Hayford. In retrospect, the subject's initial declaration that, quote: "My name's whatever you want it to be, honey" was an attempt to convince me to pay for sexual services and not an actual indication that the subject's name was, in fact, "Vera Keyes", as this would certainly have been quite an amazing bit of serendipity.
GID00087042	Considering, however, that the entire reason I selected this female as my next test subject was for that alone, I may need to reconsider this entire phase of the project. 
GID00087043	Demoralizing, but I shall proceed apace regardless.
GID00087044	Supplies
GID00087045	Need to cook up some more of my special meat pies. Angel should be coming past before long and I need to trade for some ammo. Evidently there is a raider crowd down the road who are quite partial to my cooking. Just as well, some more ingredients have turned up.
GID00087046	Andrew Poke's Diary - 2114
GID00087047	My wife has been nagging me to stay out of that tunnel again. I think everyone has forgotten why we originally came here but I've never lost my curiosity about that storage vault, what was it called? Ground House?
GID00087048	I managed to pull out some wiring at that security door and have been trying to hook up a computer to it. There is still some sort of network there I think, but I'll be damned if I can hack into it. I'm sure we brought the access code with us, was it David that had it? He never came back from Vegas.
GID00087049	My son sits and watches me, maybe he will have better luck some day. Truth be known we still don't know if there is anything behind that door. Maybe my wife is right, I should give it up, I'm too old for this now.
GID00087050	Andrew Poke's Diary - 2104 
GID00087051	Some people have headed south while the rest of us are still hanging on here, it's not been easy but we are surviving. We have had help from some outsiders joining us, the stories they have been sharing do not paint a nice picture of the world.
GID00087052	We still haven't given up on the storage vault, we cleared some of the rubble away from a building on top of the tunnel to find an entrance and we managed to break into what I think is part of the tunnel maintenance system. Typically they lead to the same place. We came to stop at a security door, it looks like someone has been here before us and tried to blow it which has ruled out that option for us. The whole thing could come down. Still, at least we don't actually need it now. We are surviving without it.
GID00087053	Andrew Poke's Diary - 2104 
GID00087054	Heard from Charlie, he tried Vegas but I don't think it was much good and it sounds like he has settled at a place further south of here. Good to hear from the old buzzard.

GID00087068	2106
GID00087069	It's all fallen apart, there has been a mutiny.
GID00087070	I confronted Dr. Nice today. Part way through the conversation I realised he had been taking his own treatment, I could see it on him. They have kept it so dark in here because of the other patients I hadn't noticed but when I got up close...my god, even the security personnel are using. Nice said it was the only way forward if we are to survive and had me scheduled to start soon! 
GID00087071	No way! I'm not taking that shit, it's not even been proven to work. I know of other places outside the Vault I might be able shelter in. The details were stored in the train yard office but should have been deleted and moved to the Vault mainframe, I have the access code for the file in my safe.
GID00087072	As for getting out of here, there is an emergency evacuation store and exit I can access from this office, I just never expected to have to use it. 
GID00087073	How did it come to this?
GID00087074	Vault 66 Overseer Log Entry 09
GID00087075	2106
GID00087076	I've been utterly betrayed. When I checked the emergency store I realized how Poke and his traitors planned to escape and survive. They had taken everything. Looted the entire stock. How did they know about it? Why did I never check it?
GID00087077	I can't even get out, they have locked the emergency exit from the outside, the bastards. I've tried to find a way through the lock but I can't. They have killed me. 
GID00087078	It won't take Nice and his cronies long to get in here, they have already shut off all the main system functions in this office from the mainframe. I'm not going to be turned into one of them. And they are not going to use me like those others they drag in. I'm going to take every drug I've got, then finish it.
GID00087079	I would tell them all to go to hell, but we are already here.
GID00087080	Note
GID00087081	Do not activate this robot. It's behaving very strangely.

GID00087084	V66 Security Log Entry 05
GID00087085	Now I'm the new security chief we can get this Vault in order. I never liked the Captain and all his military bullshit, this is a Vault-Tec facility and should be ran as such.
GID00087086	What's more Dr. Nice has been making some real advances in his research. I've been with him a long time and potentially we could be around for a lot longer. Not sure about the overseer though, I don't think he understands the bigger picture of what Dr. Nice is trying to achieve.
GID00087087	V66 Security Log Entry 06
GID00087088	We have shut up the Overseer's office as instructed by Dr' Nice. 
GID00087089	When he saw what was inside he found it funny, it was the first time I've seen him laugh. I thought he might want to use it, but he wasn't interested so it's just been sealed. It's too near the atrium anyway, I hate those lights used to keep the trees alive.
GID00087090	I always thought the Overseer's office had a secret exit anyway? I'm sure I've seen something about one. I would look but if he never used it then I guess I must be mistaken.
GID00087091	V66 Security Log Entry 07
GID00087092	We have just found this kid in the sewer, screaming for help. How the hell did he get there? Claims he found some sort of service tunnel and fell down a shaft. Must be talking about one of the water intake shafts, I didn't think it was possible to get in that way. More importantly he has been singing like a canary and says he wasn't alone, so I've stepped up the security patrols. I'm sure this young fellow will prove to be useful as well.
GID00087093	V66 Security Log Entry 08
GID00087094	This latest group of scavengers are much more organized than any we have encountered before. Some of them appear to be wearing a uniform of some description, these must be the 'New California Republic' creatures we have heard about.
GID00087095	With this increased threat I've ordered a lock down. Elevators to be disabled and corridors to be locked when not required. We will see how they get on with the external defenses before we take direct action.
GID00087096	I tried to consult with Dr. Nice but he hasn't been himself recently.
GID00087097	V66 Security Log Entry 01
GID00087098	2086
GID00087099	The first excursion outside the Vault has been authorized. The mission is to check the local area only, basically the train yard.
GID00087100	The Overseer was surprised by this, evidently exploratory reconnaissance from the vault were not in Vault-Tec's operating procedures. They are in military ones though, and that's what I'm going by. 
GID00087101	It seems the local area wasn't badly affected by the war, which is odd. I was expecting a nuclear wasteland, but instead we found the area simply derelict through lack of maintenance. There is evidence of some low level looting, which indicates a human presence still and we did find some strange fauna and flora around. I wonder what condition Vegas is in?
GID00087102	We didn't detect any coherent radio transmissions, but we are not in a particularly good area in these mountains.
GID00087103	We secured the train yard, checked the defense systems, which were all in good order and withdrew as per orders. Personally I think we should have gone further, but I think the Overseer is understandably worried about contamination. This disease that has appeared isn't going away.
GID00087104	V66 Security Log Entry 02
GID00087105	2091
GID00087106	It's time for another recon outside the vault. We are authorized to explore a little further this time and check the valley entrances.
GID00087107	The west route has been blocked by landslides, but the east is clear. I would use the rail road though and avoid the car tunnel. There is a lot of water coming through the tunnel lining and it has started to erode it, especially around the east end. I'm guessing the war must have brought about some pretty harsh weather conditions.
GID00087108	That disease has taken hold now. Strangely, although I'm not an expert, we can detect no trace of it out here, but I guess the doc knows what he is doing. Strict decontamination procedures are being kept.
GID00087109	V66 Security Log Entry 03
GID00087110	2096
GID00087111	Time for another recon. The Overseer is really against these excursions and the Doc seems reticent about them. Must be down to this disease which keeps re-occurring, but I insisted. We can't stay in this Vault forever can we? By my calculations we are due to exit in about 20 years.
GID00087112	We went out as far as Sawmill Junction. Importantly we found traces of a large group that had passed through this area recently and judging by what we found they were probably from a Vault but we couldn't determine which one. It appears they were heading north, not sure if they were heading towards something or away from something. Again some more of this mutated wildlife, even a plant that spits some sort of venom.
GID00087113	Supplemental:
GID00087114	Further reconnaissance has now been banned on orders from the Overseer and Dr Nice.
GID00087115	The pair of them have put their foot down. I can fight Vault bullshit with military bullshit but not medical bullshit as well.

GID00087117	2096 Security Log Supplemental
GID00087118	I looked around the church, which was in a pretty bad way, and recovered some scraps of paper and anything that could give an idea to what is going on outside of the Vault. I was breaking the rules, but I did it anyway, I had already sent the others back to the Vault.
GID00087119	From what I could gather society has pretty much fallen apart, which isn't surprising, but I could find no reference to any sort of plague or disease.
GID00087120	On route back to the Vault I came across a 'survivor' who was living in a cave above the old car tunnel. He froze when he saw me, I guess the whole spacesuit look freaked him out. I managed to calm him down a bit and get some information from him before he ran off.
GID00087121	He confirmed that the other group was also from a Vault and it's people from Vaults he is scared of, said we were all diseased or crazy but the symptoms of these other Vault occupants bore no relation to ours. What's more he stated that no such infections occurred in any of those people he knew. Could this be purely a Vault problem? And if so how did it occur?
GID00087122	This leads to some very awkward questions.

GID00087129	I've been talking with one of our chief engineers, Charlie Dunn. Clever guy, but a bit of a militant and as security chief we are normally at odds with each other. But I need his help so it was time to put aside our differences and Charlie loved the irony of me rebelling.
GID00087130	I need to find out what is going on and Charlie, with my help, is the man who can get into the vault systems to find out. Turns out he already knows about a few things he shouldn't, including some things I didn't know.
GID00087131	It's time to answer those awkward questions.
GID00087132	V66 Security Chief Personal Log Entry 03
GID00087133	2098
GID00087134	Well, I wanted to find out what was going on and I have. What do they say? Be careful what you wish for.
GID00087135	I finally got to the Overseer's terminal and I read it over and over but still couldn't believe it. We are nothing more than fucking lab rats. How the hell did they ever think they could get away with it? But then they have haven't they?
GID00087136	I need to concentrate on what do next, what I can do something about, not what I should do, which is to kill these Vault-Tec drones. I have to focus.
GID00087137	I can't trust most of my security team as they are all Vault-Tec. I'm the odd one, last minute replacement drafted in from the Army. Need to work out who I can trust then get us out of here. Need to get people to trust me, Jesus, I was part of this.
GID00087138	This will not look good on the resume.

GID00087141	We have a plan. We have a way out and have dug out information on some government facility called 'Ground House', which might just suit our needs.
GID00087142	Andrew Poke's Diary - 2103 
GID00087143	We have finally got to Ground House, and it is not good. The whole thing looks like it's collapsed. More specifically it looks like the place has been blown up, god knows why.
GID00087144	So what now? We are sheltering in the tunnel, it still seems to be solid enough around the entrance. At least we have water here and there enough wildlife around here to hunt.
GID00087145	Some of the group want to head south to Vegas, but I'm not buying it. I think we should stay away from any large centers of population.
GID00087146	Andrew Poke's Diary - 2117
GID00087147	Vault 66 was due to open this year, but nothing has been seen. Every now and then we get a story of folks disappearing around the train yard, but we stay away. It's kind of achieved boogeyman status now. Locals here know but no one says anything. They seem to believe if you don't speak of it, then it's not real.
GID00087148	Someday the outside world will find it, then there will be a reckoning.
GID00087149	Note
GID00087150	We are out of here, you're not turning us into one of your experimental zombies. Did you actually think we would buy into that biological warfare shit? We will take our chances outside.
GID00087151	PS, Thank the Overseer for all of his survival gear.
GID00087152	Research Memo
GID00087153	Chief,
GID00087154	I've "confined" Dr. Nice to his office, it didn't seem right to put him in one of the cages as we have done with others in the past.
GID00087155	We may be able to do something in the future for him, but these compounds we are dealing with are just so complex.
GID00087156	We can only carry on with his work and hope we find a solution, but since he was the mind behind all this, his condition is a real setback for us. Dr. Nice thought he had this under control, but we must have missed something. We will do what we can.
GID00087157	Senior Research Technician
GID00087158	PP Dr. Nice
GID00087159	Research Memo
GID00087160	Chief,
GID00087161	Thank you for your concern regarding the ultraviolet lighting used to maintain the flora. I am well aware of the harmful effects photophobia can have on our residents, but you must understand that these plants have an important function in our air filtration system and if we switch the lights off permanently, they will die.
GID00087162	We can shut the atrium off for periods when the lights are on, and suitable eye protection can be worn by anyone who has to go in there. You already have the modified issue security helmets used for external patrols & snatch squads.
GID00087163	Senior Research Technician
GID00087164	PP Dr. Nice
GID00087165	P.S.
GID00087166	If you handle the current "visitors" correctly, we will have enough livestock that we won't have to venture outside for the forseeable future.
GID00087167	Diary 02: Cpl Sherwood
GID00087168	We have hit a problem as we can't get in, sounds like we don't have the access codes for some reason. The captain in desperation just decided to blast his way in the first entrance he came to, and only managed to bring down the tunnel. Now we are seriously fucked. We located a service entrance, tried the same thing and almost achieved the same results. Now we can't force that either without collapsing it. It would be funny, but he is now panicking and taking it out on us.
GID00087169	He finally listened to one of the sappers who suggested we could dig our way in. We have blasted as much as we dare and are now going at it with whatever tools we have, but the guys are really keen as there maybe some decent food and shelter for us at the end of it.
GID00087170	Diary 03: Cpl. Sherwood
GID00087171	Well, we made it, but it's not all we hoped for. The vault was obviously subject to some cutbacks. It's letting in water, the air is fetid and the reactor is leaking.
GID00087172	There are supplies here, but the captain has managed to bring a train up and is shipping the stuff straight out. I'm sure him and his little inner circle are helping themselves to it, but most of us are getting nothing. The rest of us are exhausted as we are having to hump everything by hand through the hole we dug to get in.
GID00087173	Diary 04: Cpl. Sherwood
GID00087174	I've found this working terminal but there are no records, I guess the main server is dead. I told the Captain I'm still working on recovering data but I'm just using it to type up my diary. It beats humping stores around and I don't trust myself to leave the food alone. I am so hungry.
GID00087175	Diary 05: Cpl. Sherwood
GID00087176	One of the train carriages broke down. It's been repaired by scavenging parts from the rearmost carriage which is being abandoned. We are taking the remaining supplies by road in what vehicles we have. Two guys from 2nd Company took some of the food as they were shifting it, then the captain found out and had them shot.
GID00087177	Diary 06: Cpl. Sherwood
GID00087178	We have had enough. They were making some of the guys move the barrels of radioactive waste outside into the collapsed chamber. We rounded the captain and all his cronies up and locked them all in the reactor room, so they can see what it feels like. 
GID00087179	They will get out soon enough, but the radiation will kill them before long and even if it doesn't we are going to bring the rest of this tunnel down to seal them in.
GID00087180	We have eaten what we wanted and are taking the remaining supplies for ourselves. We are going to head back to try and find our families. Screw the military, screw the government. There's nothing left to fight for, no country left to serve. Its all gone to hell and they sent it there.
GID00087181	Diary 01: Cpl. Sherwood
GID00087182	March, 2078. We're here. Hoping to find food and supplies in this supply bunker. Maybe shelter as well, I'm sick of Rad-X and my respirator is starting to pull the skin off my face. There are still radiation clouds everywhere, but at least the black rain hasn't returned.
GID00087183	The captain isn't helping though, he has become a real martinet. He has already shot one man for insubordination and desertion is starting to become more common.

GID00087205	SUBJECT: Project Stone Case
GID00087206	FUNCTION: Security of local government assets in the case of thermonuclear war.
GID00087207	PROPOSAL: Small storage bunker & bank vault with provision for 4(four) man security team. 
GID00087208	Projected life span: 10(ten) years once sealed.

GID00087210	Project Stone Case amendment - Reference mail Davies/Barker
GID00087211	Martin, 
GID00087212	1. We have halted further construction work on Stone Case. Gotta love budget cuts, huh?
GID00087213	We should have enough to scrape together something functional, however.
GID00087214	2. Limited stores are to be stransported to this location - do not bring any further supplies. "They" want to spread everything out a bit as a precaution, but we will use the bank vault as that is fully functional.
GID00087215	3. "They" sent down the order that security will be entirely automated now, both to limit provision consumption and due to a recent psychologist report from Project Safehouse, stating that a flesh-and-blood security team is unlikely to survive the stresses of isolation or feel any particular loyalty to the HVTs after an apocalyptic event. Sounds like RobCo lobbyist bullshit, but what can you do?
GID00087216	4. When the automated security systems arrive, make sure you change their deactivation codes. Just about everyone knows the RobCo factory default is 1C 3C R34 M.

GID00087246	Hey Blinder, you idiot!
GID00087247	Do you remember the name 'Burgess'? That name one of those clowns who disappeared down that tunnel of yours a few years back mentioned? Well, guess who has turned up and camped out in the old house at the top of Hayford? A ghoul, nasty piece of work and asking a lot of questions.
GID00087248	Sent - Blue Ray
GID00087249	Yeah, I remember.
GID00087250	Well, don't just sit there with your thumb up your ass, find out what his game is. Give his drum a spin if you have to, but don't use Emma, she's a good girl. Find a passing wastelander, preferably one with an IQ at least into double figures (which of course rules you out).
GID00087251	Received 2 - Blue Ray
GID00087252	Of course I won't use Emma, you cretin. And keep your eye out for a group of mercs under NCR command. Not sure what they are up to, but they are bad news.
GID00087253	And have you sorted out your Lurk farm yet, or are they still getting eaten by the fruit plants? That's so funny, but if you do get it sorted send some of the Lurk meat down with Angel.
GID00087254	Received 3 - Blue Ray
GID00087255	Hey Fuckstick, 
GID00087256	I've got some news on Burgess. I got this ugly looking prospector to go through his place. It seems he is interested in Ground House and I reckon this prospector has some more info on it. I've gave your name and told them to look you up. Be careful, this one has an arsenal and isn't shy about using it.
GID00087257	Oh, and that NCR outfit? Seems they are looking for freak central. That's going to get messy.
GID00087258	Hotel Log 1
GID00087259	A group of mercs-turned-prospectors turned up today. We did some trading and they crashed at the hotel overnight, I think they are heading to Zion for some reason although they were pretty tight lipped about it. From what I gather there has been some falling out within the group as well, maybe there are some more of them around, I'll keep my eye out.
GID00087260	Burgess
GID00087261	I need to get to the bottom of this guy's story. He has been here about a month now, but he is not the settling down type of person.
GID00087262	He is a mean and nasty piece of work, which has been useful dealing with our local raider problems, but he has been snooping around everywhere and asking an awful lot of questions.
GID00087263	He has an angle somewhere and I need to find out what it is.
GID00087264	Burgess' Blackboard Notes
GID00087265	Ground House Entrance
GID00087266	1. Down the train tunnel - couldn't find it before, maybe they cleared away some of the debris, they have had plenty of time.
GID00087267	2. Transformer station? There was a destroyed building above the tunnel entrance, maybe it was underneath that?
GID00087268	3. The utility shaft in the train tunnel? I thought that was just ventilation.
GID00087269	4. May be another entrance, the lake water was flowing somewhere, an underwater cave?
GID00087270	Burgess' Diary Page 1
GID00087271	Never thought I would be back here again. 
GID00087272	I've done some scouting for an NCR big cheese, they pay well for someone who gets results and can keep their mouths shut. But when they mentioned a Vault up in the mountains north of Vegas...it would have made my hair stand on end if I had any.
GID00087273	Burgess' Diary Page 2
GID00087274	I needed to bring my own knowledge up to date and I've got some information from a hobo in Westside. Most thought he was just another bum with a treasure map but I recognized some of the info as solid. He was quite forthcoming once I had slapped him around a bit. 
GID00087275	I need to head back that way, gather more information, do some research. There is another loose end I would like to tie up as well.
GID00087276	Burgess' Diary Page 3
GID00087277	I've passed on what I've acquired to some NCR drone called Kelly. His merry band are off to make their fortune and have no idea what is waiting for them. Not sure myself, to be honest.
GID00087278	I'm really tempted to go and watch how this all pans out, as it would be quite entertaining, but I need to keep my distance. I'll pick up the pieces later when they have all knocked themselves out.

GID00087280	Ground House access code:
GID00087281	SD45-889G-00IU-323X
GID00087282	---------------------------------
GID00087283	Its been 6 years since I sent Bennet and his three stooges up to check on 'Ground House'. I know they got there as they sent a message back saying there was now a place called Rita's Cafe built on it. Then nothing. I would've known if they had returned, I would have picked them up in Vegas.
GID00087284	Fucking amateurs. I knew I shouldn't have given them the access codes.
GID00087285	Burgess' Instructions
GID00087286	Bennet,
GID00087287	Listen you idiot, check out the local area and find out if anyone ever managed to find or access this 'Ground House'. I've told you where it's likely to be if it does exist.
GID00087288	I know this is difficult for you but try and be discreet. If it's still a possibility let me know, I'll deal with it personally. 
GID00087289	DO. 
GID00087290	NOT. 
GID00087291	GO. 
GID00087292	IN.
GID00087293	=- Burgess
GID00087294	Warning Note
GID00087295	Tell Jerry he can store his precious robots in the cistern if he wants to. Just make sure no one shuts off the waterfall, because with the high water that place will fill up in seconds and I don't think they are amphibious.
GID00087296	Note
GID00087297	Don't worry about the robots.
GID00087298	I've locked out the sluice gate controls so they can't be operated accidentally and set the gates, outflow open, cistern closed. The only way the cistern can be flooded is if someone was to operate the emergency override valves so it was the other way around, and what idiot would do that? I've locked the door anyway.
GID00087299	Lillypad Field
GID00087300	The place is called Lillypad field. You reach it via Follett Passage, behind the waterfall, the entrance is behind Greta's bus, it's marked on your gadget and I've given you the key.
GID00087301	I reckon 20 raiders/walking plants or whatever you want to call them, and 10 of those spitting plants. They may be awkward to find, but they shouldn't have any problems finding you. If you get stuck just run around, you'll see them. Kill them all then come and see me.
GID00087302	There is a old hunting shack down the south end of the field. The key is in a pot by one of the doors. As a gesture of good faith you can use it and help yourself to whatever is in there.
GID00087303	Blinder
GID00087304	Capt. Kelly - Log Entry 01
GID00087305	I was concerned when our initial recon party, or what was left of it, returned and reported another group in the area. It would appear they were also looking for the Vault and quite organized. I thought this Vault was meant to be undisclosed? 
GID00087306	The survivor confirmed the trainyard's existence but that's it. Sometimes I feel I'm wasting my time with these idiots. Fortunately our other source is more reliable.
GID00087307	Capt. Kelly - Log Entry 02
GID00087308	So far progress has been good. It's never easy dealing with hired mercenaries, particularly this Viper scum, but for this kind of mission it is necessary. They are generally easy to dispose of as well once their purpose has been served.
GID00087309	We have reached a settlement of sorts called Hayford. Not much here except for our contact who exchanged the last of his information for payment. I was curious how he got it but he was keeping his mouth shut. That's one of the reasons we pay him, ironically. Can't stand zombies anyway.
GID00087310	Up ahead the road is blocked by raiders. They are well positioned but we have the resources to deal with them and it will make for a good shake down and see if we can drill this rag tag outfit into shape.
GID00087311	Capt. Kelly - Log Entry 03
GID00087312	We have located the trainyard and sent in another recon. We have lost  more personnel than I anticipated on route to raiders, random snipers, etc. The last one was particularly nasty but now we can get on with the business at hand.
GID00087313	Capt. Kelly - Log Entry 04
GID00087314	I've made this cave complex our HQ for the meantime as it suits our purpose quite well and we are not the first to use it, there were quite a lot of materials already here we could salvage.
GID00087315	I've held off moving into the trainyard as our reconnaissance showed there were quite a few service tunnels around plus defenses, robotic it would appear. Anyway I don't want any damn robots popping out of the wall when I'm trying to manage this operation.
GID00087316	Capt Kelly - Log Entry 05
GID00087317	We have found no trace of the other group our recon clashed with, other than some trash dumped in this cave as it would appear they also used it. There was some sort of diary entry as well but it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. Pity.
GID00087318	On the plus side we have lost a few Vipers to the Vault defenses so the prognosis is good as it would indicate the Vault is still intact. 
GID00087319	Capt. Kelly - Log Entry 06
GID00087320	It appears our sniper at the church has returned. He caused us some casualties on our way in and gave us the slip when we cleared the area, but now it seems he is back, the tenacious bastard.
GID00087321	I've held off killing him as we don't have the resources right now, I want to concentrate on locating the Vault and time is pressing. Besides, with all the casualties we have taken on the way here, it might be worth trying to recruit him. I could use a man like that.
GID00087322	Capt. Kelly - Log Entry 07
GID00087323	Curiously we have had a couple of people disappear. They have most likely become victim of some defense system but we can't locate the bodies. Granted they were only Vipers, so it's not a major issue, but we do only have a limited supply of them.
GID00087324	Orders
GID00087325	Kelly, M. 
GID00087326	Captain 
GID00087327	57465890
GID00087328	Kelly, I want to make clear to you the priorities of this mission.
GID00087329	I've stuck my neck out for this, getting resources without getting noticed is a pain in the ass so make the most of it. Buy what and who you have to, but remember the coffers are not bottomless and keep as low a profile as you can. As far as command is concerned, this is just another recon mission and they don't need to know any different. And keep away from any Rangers, those boys have no business sense.
GID00087330	1. Confirm if this Vault information is true, I don't want to waste time chasing another goddamn tall story.
GID00087331	2. If you find it and it's already been burned and looted, check it out but do not waste any more time on it than you have to. If we can cover our expenses that will do.
GID00087332	3. If it's still sealed, find a way in and establish if there is anyone inside. I know that might not be easy, but you have shown aptitude in the past and I'm sure you won't let me down.
GID00087333	4. If it's empty, catalog the state of the facility and what is worth selling and keeping. If the place is serviceable, it may be worth selling to whoever offers the most, I've got a contact that can deal with the details.
GID00087334	5. If it's occupied, then send in whatever contactors you have hired to clear the place out. I don't want to be troubled by any vault dwellers looking for handouts. Once done revert to the above instruction.
GID00087335	6. Once the situation is secure, get rid of any contractors that are left and pay off those troops that were in on the mission. I'll provide the discharge papers for them. Make sure they know to keep their mouths shut.
GID00087336	If this pans out, we won't even need our pathetic little pensions. Handle this right, the Senator despises having to clean up messes.

GID00087355	It's called Zion, man. 
GID00087356	Some pre-war national park, whatever that was, full of fresh water, all the food you can eat and only some dumbass tribals living there. They'll probably think we're gods when we turn up with energy weapons. All ours for the taking.
GID00087357	It's like this; the place is known about but only by some caravans and they kept the route pretty much to themselves. Thing is it goes over the mountains, which is a pretty rough track and it takes them fucking years to get there. But there is another way. We got ourselves a pre-war map that shows the road. 
GID00087358	Of course there is a down side. The road snakes off through a load of canyons and is prime bush-whacking territory, not to mention landslides, poisonous bugs and all the rest of that stuff, but there are enough of us now to make this work, especially with the guns from our last score.
GID00087359	And once we clear the road in, we then invite every other schmuck from Vegas, but we set up a toll just before they get in there. They have to pay! And we just live off the land and watch the caps roll in! We can't lose.
GID00087360	We're all meeting at that old Route 95 rest stop, north of here. Here's the location and the key.
GID00087361	Trail Log 2 of 43: Daniel - Day 1
GID00087362	I'm sitting this one out. There are too many unknowns and lets face it, our crew isn't exactly a squad of Rangers. JD runs a tight ship and can be ruthless, but I'm not sure even he can pull this off.
GID00087363	I mean, what's he got? Sure, Pinky's on board, but he isn't getting any younger and I suppose Spencer has been around a bit and is OK.
GID00087364	Linda is a decent medic, if you can keep her out of her own drugs long enough, and then you got Finger and Suzy, a couple of wide eyed ex-raiders, also too fond of their chems.
GID00087365	Max who isn't too bright, but he's bright enough to let JD do the thinking and big enough so people leave him alone, and Spider can be useful as well. He can talk his way into anything, although that brings its own problems as it tends to be other men's women.
GID00087366	Bernie and Jack are good in a fight, but you should never confuse anger with courage and I wouldn't trust 'em as far as could comfortably spit them.
GID00087367	Bethany's clever, good with tech but she has issues, that girl seems to hate everyone. Then at the other end of the scale there is Jason who is as thick as molerat shit and a bit casual with other people's property.
GID00087368	Finally you got the Cope brothers, who are pretty solid I guess, just a bit intense. And of course Wellington, our pack Brahmin, probably the most reliable of the lot.
GID00087369	The skills are there, the problem is getting them to pull in the same direction and I doubt even a hard-ass like JD can get that to work on a long expedition.
GID00087370	Trail Log 3 of 43: Joseph - Day 1
GID00087371	I detest it when people say we can't lose, it's tempting fate.
GID00087372	The map seems genuine enough. Spider got it from a hobo in Westside for a bottle of rotgut, or so he says. This character said he knows the route well and even marked it for fellow hobos somehow.
GID00087373	Normally I would just laugh, every wastelander has a treasure map but Pinky says he knows him. Said his name was Ezra, in his day a prospector and a good one too. Evidently he had some really big scores but then got a taste for Vegas, and hence his new career path as a bum.
GID00087374	It can't be that simple though. Life just isn't like that.
GID00087375	Trail Log 4 of 43: Bernie - Day 2
GID00087376	We're all in apart from Daniel. Says it's fool's gold. I think he has just gone soft in his old age, the old man would just slow us down anyway.
GID00087377	Keep your eye on Spider as well. He's been acting a little weird and I reckon he has an angle somewhere. I'm not worried as he's just a kid and if he pulls a fast one it will be his last, we just need to keep an eye on him, that's all.
GID00087378	Trail Log 5 of 43: JD - Day 2
GID00087379	Jack's such an asshole. Does he honestly think we can just follow the map and take it all for ourselves? And set up a toll? Every fucker we come across will already be doing that. We are gonna have to fight and pay all the way to Zion.
GID00087380	But I've heard some good things about the place, unspoiled. And if the route is viable, well, that's information. And to people like the NCR and Crimson Caravan that's worth hard caps. Legion gold if it comes to that.
GID00087381	First stop is this place on the map called Hayford, I've heard there is a place to re-supply there.
GID00087382	Trail Log 6 of 43: Spencer - Day 2
GID00087383	Spider sprung one on me today. Says that hobo told him of a vault in the canyons. Says it still locked up tight. Came to me because I'm the vault expert and Bernie and Jack are dicks.
GID00087384	Makes sense I suppose, the entire population went underground during the war and there are Vaults, shelters and holes everywhere.
GID00087385	Maybe I shouldn't have mouthed off about Vaults though. Sure I've been to Vault 34, didn't actually go in there, too much radiation. And I did go into Vault 22. Just. Well I looked inside. I thought the sign was just to put people off, but that place was too freaky.
GID00087386	I have been into Vault 19 to make a trade with some Powder Gangers, but I'll be damned if I was going to stick around to look about. Ironically, I then spent half of the caps in the only other Vault I've been in, Vault 21. Not sure if that counts.
GID00087387	The hobo was probably just playing with the kid but then Spider does have a way with people. He's a silver tongued fucker, I've known him to get inside a women's pants in less than 10 minutes. 
GID00087388	But a real deal un-opened Vault? They were meant to keep out nukes, how the hell are we going to get in? But what if we could? And who or what is inside?
GID00087389	Trail Log 7 of 43: Jason - Day 3
GID00087390	They are laughing at me for paying for the hobo's stash. They think I've been taken, but the hobo swears it's where he left an emergency stockpile that he has never been able to get back to. I have a good feeling about it, my luck's gotta turn after Vegas, I'm due. It's buried in the grave of some one called Count Abraham Jefferson III. I thought we killed him at Goodsprings? That's gotta be a sign. It's the big one, I just know it. They won't be laughing then.
GID00087391	Trail Log 8 of 43: JD - Day 3
GID00087392	It all went to shit today. That didn't take long.
GID00087393	Bernie & Jack said Spider fell and was killed by that waterfall, reckon he was trying to climb down to get some water. Some of the others are not buying it, and to be honest neither am I. There has been bad blood between them ever since Spider fucked that piece of tail Bernie had his eye on in Primm.
GID00087394	We checked but Spider was gone, no sign of him. I really don't need this shit right now, it's going to be a long journey and I really need everyone on board.
GID00087395	Spencer was really mad, I didn't realize him and Spider were so tight. I cooled it down, but it's not over. We will camp here tonight, we can hunt some mantises and Spencer wants to do another search for Spider, which is worth a shot I suppose.
