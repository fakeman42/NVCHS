FO300000094	That's secure for a reason.
FO300000095	Hands off.

FO300000117	Ho chum! What's the word?
FO300000118	You're brave to keep bothering me. Or stupid.
FO300000119	I hope you know what you're doing. You could get in a lot of trouble by coming around uninvited.
FO300000120	What are you doing here? It's not safe for your kind around here.
FO300000121	Hello. What is it?
FO300000122	What the hell do you want?
FO300000123	Pleased to meet you. I'm Knight Dillon. If there's anything you need here, I'll try and help.
FO300000124	Hello again.
FO300000125	Knight Finley at your service. What can I do for you?
FO300000126	What is it you needed?
FO300000127	Welcome to the Galaxy News Radio Outpost. I'm Sergeant Wilks, and I'm in charge here. What brings you into the D.C. area?
FO300000128	What else can I help you with?
FO300000129	Sorry, I'm on guard duty. Wouldn't want this place to get overrun with Super Mutants.
FO300000130	Sentinel Lyons calls the shots around here. If you need anything, she can probably help you.
FO300000131	Bring on some more Super Mutants! I'm not finished with them yet!
FO300000132	Babysitting this place is no picnic, I can tell you that.
FO300000133	Thanks for your help. We'll take any we can get.
FO300000134	If you need something, talk to one of the Knights. They can help you.
FO300000135	What's up?
FO300000136	Hey, all right! The Hero of the Wasteland returns!
FO300000137	You got the dish! I knew the Good Fight could count on you!
FO300000138	Now, get that sucker over to the Washington Monument pronto and I'll get to singing your praises!
FO300000139	No use hanging around the station. Get the dish to the top of the Washington Monument as soon as possible.
FO300000140	You look like someone with about a million questions. Lay 'em on me.
FO300000141	What else can Three Dog do for you?
FO300000142	I've told you the score, all you need to do is play the game. You in?
FO300000143	So, you ready to make a deal? Or are you just trying to get another look at my strikingly handsome face?
FO300000144	The look on your face says it all. You're wondering who the heck this guy is and why you should care. Well, prepare to be enlightened.
FO300000145	So, you came back. That's good. The Good Fight can always use another soldier.
FO300000146	You're new. And you're too big to be a resident. Who are you?
FO300000147	Who are you? What are you doing in here?
FO300000148	Got yourself a boo-boo?
FO300000149	What sort of scrape did you get yourself into, this time?
FO300000150	Got yourself another few scrapes?
FO300000151	Yes?
FO300000152	Well, here's something I don't see every day. A new face in Little Lamplight!
FO300000153	A bit big for one of our kids, but you seem all right. What's your story down here?
FO300000154	Well, now here's something new. What's a grown-up like you doing in Little Lamplight?
FO300000155	Don't tell me MacCready's going soft on us!
FO300000156	Is there something you'd like to learn?
FO300000157	What's happening?
FO300000158	Great, RJ let in another pair of choppers to eat up all our food.
FO300000159	Well, as long as you don't give me any crap about how I prepare your grub, I guess you'll be okay.
FO300000160	So, tell me: what do you think of cave fungus in watery mushroom sauce?
FO300000161	Okay, RJ had better have had a good reason to let you in.
FO300000162	Because right now, all I'm seeing is a mungo who's here to take our food and screw us over.
FO300000163	Come on and get your grub!
FO300000164	Ready for some fine roast beast served in a creamy ginger sauce?
FO300000165	Yeah, I'll bet you are! Too bad it's still fungus chunks for us all!
FO300000166	Hey, what's up?
FO300000167	Hewwo, I'm Biwwy. Wewcome to Wittwe Wampwight!
FO300000168	Hey, you wook wike you'we handy with a weapon. I got kicked off the scav team, so I guess I don't need mine anymowe.
FO300000169	Wanna buy my wazer wifle? Five hundwed caps, and it's aww youws!
FO300000170	Hewwo, mistaw.
FO300000171	Hewwo, miss.
FO300000172	I'm going on an adventure!
FO300000173	Whoa. You're big. You must be the biggest kid here!
FO300000174	I'm the littlest kid. My real name's Betty. But mostly, I get called Bumble.
FO300000175	What're you called, big kid?
FO300000176	Whoa. I've never seen a mungo so close.
FO300000177	Are you a Raider? Or a Slaver? Or a Mutant?
FO300000178	'Cause if you are, I'm supposed to go hide 'cause I'm too young to use a gun yet.
FO300000179	Uh oh. Now what?
FO300000180	You want to talk to me?
FO300000181	Just leave me alone, okay?
FO300000182	I hate you! Go away!
FO300000183	I don't want to talk with you!
FO300000184	Hey, new kid. I don't know if anyone told you yet, but let me set the record straight.
FO300000185	I'm Princess. When you're around me, I'm in charge. You shut up and do what I say, because I'm boss around here. That clear?
FO300000186	Now, who're you?
FO300000187	What the hell is RJ thinking, letting a damned mungo like you in here?
FO300000188	So, who're you working with? Raiders? Slavers? Mutants?
FO300000189	Answer up, mungo!
FO300000190	Well, look who's here. What's up, mungo?
FO300000191	Well, if it isn't the magnificent mungo. What now?
FO300000192	New in town, huh? If MacCready let you in, that's good enough for me.
FO300000193	Well, enough with formalities: who are you, and how'd you get MacCready to let you in here?
FO300000194	Whoa, are we letting mungos in, now? Didn't hear any shots, so I'm guessing you're not here to raid us.
FO300000195	And if you're not here to raid us, you might just have brought something cool for us, see? So who are you, and how'd you get let in?
FO300000196	Hey, picked up anything out there?
FO300000197	Anything you'd like to get off your hands?
FO300000198	Got something to say?
FO300000199	New in town, huh? Well, if MacCready let you in, that's a good sign.
FO300000200	I'm Knock Knock, and I take care of 'keeping the peace' down here. Or, at least the morale.
FO300000201	So, who're you? You going to cause any trouble?
FO300000202	Hey, are we letting mungos in, now? Didn't hear a scuffle, so I'm guessing you're some sort of guest?
FO300000203	So, what's so cool about you, fancypants? Must be a pretty good reason for you to get let in, see?
FO300000204	Oh wait. Um. Never mind.
FO300000205	How're things treating you?
FO300000206	Heard anything good?
FO300000207	Wow, you're big. I mean, bigger than most people down here. I mean, bigger than most people down here that we don't shoot for being down here.
FO300000208	So, how'd you get down here without getting shot? Am I supposed to shoot you? Because, you know, I'd rather not, but if I'm supposed to, then okay.
FO300000209	The mayor said it's okay for you to be in here, right? Because mungos aren't allowed in here unless the mayor says so. So are you an okay mungo?
FO300000210	Because if you aren't an okay mungo, that means we should stop you, and that means I have to get my gun from lockdown so stay here okay?
FO300000211	Hey there. You have any Nuka-Cola? Even just a bit? Can I have some? Be your best friend. Honest. Totally. Not even kidding!
FO300000212	Oh hey, hi. You again, huh? I thought maybe you'd be blown up or shot or something by now, but I guess not. Not yet, anyway.
FO300000213	Hey, hi! Hi, lady. Hey there. What's going on? Anything new? You have any good stories? What about Nuka-Cola, you have any of that? Huh, huh?
FO300000214	Hey, hi! Hi, mister. Hey there. What's going on? Anything new? You have any good stories? What about Nuka-Cola, you have any of that? Huh, huh?
FO300000215	Thanks again for saving me. You're the best!
FO300000216	Well, you and my brother are tied for the best, at least. But that's still really good!
FO300000217	Thanks for getting me back. I really missed my brother.
FO300000218	Everyone calls you a mungo, but I think you're an okay mungo.
FO300000219	Yes?
FO300000220	Something happening?
FO300000221	What?
FO300000222	Thanks for getting us back here. We woulda got out before long, but you did really help.
FO300000223	So, uh, thanks.
FO300000224	We didn't need any mungo's help getting outta there, you know?
FO300000225	But you did it, so, uh, thanks.
FO300000226	But that means I gotta go back to guarding the back gate with Princess. Ugh.
FO300000227	Yeah, mister?
FO300000228	Yeah, miss?
FO300000229	Yeah, mungo?
FO300000230	Yeah?
FO300000231	Wow, am I glad to be back. If it weren't for you, I think we'd have died back there!
FO300000232	So, thanks for the help! If anyone asks me, you're an official kid!
FO300000233	Wow, thanks for the help out there. If it weren't for you, I'd be a goner, for sure!
FO300000234	Far as I'm concerned, you're welcome in here anytime! Of course, it isn't really up to me.
FO300000235	So, what do you need?
FO300000236	Oh, hey!
FO300000237	Is everything okay?
FO300000238	Is something wrong?
FO300000239	Look, I don't let just any son of a bitch into my town. I'm taking a risk making an exception for you.
FO300000240	So you're welcome in my town, at least until you start screwing up. Once that bullshit starts, you're out on your own again!
FO300000241	Look, I don't let just any bitch into my town, and I'm taking a risk making an exception for you.
FO300000242	So you're welcome in my town, at least until you start screwing up. Once that bullshit starts, you're out on your own again!
FO300000243	Okay, so you get in, but I got my eye on you.
FO300000244	You don't make trouble in here, got it? I ain't having no shit-butts making trouble.
FO300000245	Yeah? You got something to say?
FO300000246	How do I have to solve your bullshit problem, today?
FO300000247	So, what sort of trouble are you getting yourself into, now?
FO300000248	What do you want, mungo?
FO300000249	What now, mungo?
FO300000250	Why are you still pestering me, you moron?
FO300000251	Okay, what the hell is wrong with you, mungo? This had better be important!
FO300000252	Did you get hit in the head? You have to pester me every time a stray thought happens to wander into that hollowed out melon you call a skull?
FO300000253	Oh, what now? You come to me to talk about how nice my damned cave is? Maybe a little small talk about local soil erosion or some bullshit?
FO300000254	No, you know what? You can go take a hike, you insane mutant-fucker. Get out of my town!
FO300000255	Whoa, a mungo down here, just walking around!
FO300000256	Hey, new kid! Try and catch me!
FO300000257	Tag, you're it!
FO300000258	Aw, man! I'm it!
FO300000259	No way, that didn't count!
FO300000260	Stay away, mungo, I don't wanna catch old from you!
FO300000261	Thanks for getting Penny and Squirrel back. And Sammy too, I guess.
FO300000262	Mungo, mungo, smells like dung-o!
FO300000263	Gosh, you're big.
FO300000264	Nice as the weather is out here, how about you bring me a kid, so I can get back to Paradise Falls?
FO300000265	Just waiting for you to bring me a new friend.
FO300000266	Hey there! Got anything good for me?
FO300000267	I really don't feel like talking right now. Please leave.
FO300000268	I thought we might see you again.
FO300000269	So, you're back. What did you want?
FO300000270	Well all right! You're back!
FO300000271	There you go, good as new.
FO300000272	You made it! Great! Need patching up?
FO300000273	Looks like you pulled my fat out of the fire again. Thanks.
FO300000274	Damn, I could have used your help with those uglies.
FO300000275	Sorry, gotta get back to the Compound. Come by and visit us when you want to offload some of that data.
FO300000276	Uh oh, you're back. Something need fixing?
FO300000277	We did it! You did it! You helped us defeat the Mutants! We'll all feel safer now! Thank you so much!
FO300000278	Alright! Yeah! We sure showed those Mutants didn't we!
FO300000279	Nah, who am I kidding? There's still plenty of things out there that want to kill us.
FO300000280	At least I didn't die today. I got you to thank for that. So, thanks!
FO300000281	I think I'm going to build a little shrine to you. All I need is some incense sticks and candles.
FO300000282	We got those Mutants good, didn't we?!
FO300000283	I'm starting to feel safe for the first time in a long time. Thanks to you!
FO300000284	Oh, hey! Kinda busy here, but I guess I can talk for a bit. What's up?
FO300000285	Huh. Did you know the human body can survive without the stomach or spleen? Oh, what's up?
FO300000286	Hey, don't mind the smoke. It's perfectly safe to breathe. Really!
FO300000287	What's up? Anything interesting out there in the wild Wasteland?
FO300000288	Oh, hey. What's up?
FO300000289	Hey, someone who doesn't have a cart for me to fix or a brahmin to wash up. That's a nice change.
FO300000290	Hope you don't mind the smell of brahmin dung. It's been one of those days.
FO300000291	Hey. How's the wide, wild Wasteland out there?
FO300000292	Long time, no see.
FO300000293	Back in Arefu, eh? Good to see you again.
FO300000294	How the heck are ya'?
FO300000295	Hey there!
FO300000296	I'm glad I was wrong about you. Welcome back.
FO300000297	I heard about your little killing spree in Arefu. Get the hell away from me.
FO300000298	Get the fucking hell out of my sight. I never want to speak to you ever again.
FO300000299	Hello there, nice to see you.
FO300000300	The Family only kills what it consumes. Your murders in Arefu were for sport!
FO300000301	So you're Evan King's killer, eh? You don't look so tough to me.
FO300000302	Thanks for setting me straight on everything.
FO300000303	Always a pleasure to receive you in Meresti. What brings you down here today?
FO300000304	Hey there!
FO300000305	So, what do you need?
FO300000306	So, what do you need?
FO300000307	Hiya kid!
FO300000308	Hey, welcome back.
FO300000309	What's going on?
FO300000310	Please don't hurt me.
FO300000311	You're the bad man that hurts people, aren't you?
FO300000312	You're the bad lady that hurts people, aren't you?
FO300000313	I remember you. You're mean.
FO300000314	What do you want, meanie?
FO300000315	You shouldn't take things that don't belong to you.
FO300000316	You're bad. I don't think I should talk to you.
FO300000317	Do you like being bad? Or is it just you can't help it?
FO300000318	I bet you're so bad because your mom didn't love you.
FO300000319	I've heard of you. You're one of the good guys!
FO300000320	It makes me feel safer knowing you're around.
FO300000321	You're my hero, mister. I want to be just like you when I grow up.
FO300000322	You're my hero, ma'am. I want to be just like you when I grow up.
FO300000323	Oh, baby! Let me get you something special. How about a Dukov surprise? Hah ha!
FO300000324	Nevermind. You need a drink. Cherry! Need some fucking booze over here!
FO300000325	Hello sweet cheeks! What can old Dukov do for you?
FO300000326	Nevermind. You need a drink. Cherry! I'm thirsty over here!
FO300000327	Have you seen Cherry? I think the bitch ran out on me.
FO300000328	Who the hell are you?
FO300000329	Nevermind. You need a drink. Cherry! I'm thirsty over here!
FO300000330	Who the hell are you?
FO300000331	Nevermind. You need a drink. Fantasia! I'm thirsty over here!
FO300000332	Who the hell are you?
FO300000333	Nevermind. You need a drink. My women are gone, so help yourself.
FO300000334	Whatcha need? How about a drink? No? Suit yourself.
FO300000335	Yeah, yeah, you're my hero. Don't let it go to your head. Seriously though, thank you for getting me away from Dukov.
FO300000336	So that prick Dukov is dead. Can't say I'll miss him.
FO300000337	Even so, I'm going to need someone to protect me. A girl can't survive by herself in the Wasteland.
FO300000338	Hey, good looking. I'm Cherry. Can I do anything for you?
FO300000339	Yeah?
FO300000340	Hi, sweetie. I'm Cherry. What can I do for you?
FO300000341	Hi, sugar. I'm Cherry. Do yourself a favor. Watch yourself with Dukov. He's all hands.
FO300000342	He's dead! I'm going to miss the old lecher. We had some real fun times.
FO300000343	Who's going to look after me now?
FO300000344	Oh, my! Aren't you a stud. I'm Fantasia. If you need something, just let me know.
FO300000345	Hi there, fella. I'm Fantasia. Can I help you?
FO300000346	Hello, honey. I'm Fantasia. You're not going to be staying long, are you?
FO300000347	Make him shut up! Please, just make him shut up!
FO300000348	Hold it! This area is under the authority of the Brotherhood of Steel. Leave immediately.
FO300000349	Was I not clear enough? Leave. Now.
FO300000350	I have no time for you, Wastelander. Go.
FO300000351	Welcome back. Have you been successful in your search for books?
FO300000352	You've returned. Have you brought me any books?
FO300000353	You've saved my life. I am in your debt.
FO300000354	I am forever in your debt. Thank you.
FO300000355	We're almost to the door, don't stop now!
FO300000356	Keep going, we're almost outside!
FO300000357	Thank God someone's come! You have to help me! Please!
FO300000358	Stay on point. We will back you up. It's the least we can offer you.
FO300000359	Lead on. We will ensure your safe passage through Falls Church.
FO300000360	You have our thanks, stranger. We could not have recovered our ward without your aid.
FO300000361	Good. He is safe. The Brotherhood are men of their word and so, here is your payment. Spend it well.
FO300000362	Farewell, mercenary. May you find honor in your travels.
FO300000363	Excellent. The Initiate is safely returned to us. You have the thanks of the Brotherhood, my friend.
FO300000364	We cannot offer you much in return, but know that you may travel through Falls Church under our protection.
FO300000365	What do you mean he's dead? What kind of a lousy merc are you?
FO300000366	Damned worthless merc! You can't even pull off a simple rescue op?
FO300000367	We just weren't fast enough to save him. Damn.
FO300000368	Don't be so anxious, merc. Get our man, then you'll get your payday.
FO300000369	He's up ahead, in that building! Don't stop!
FO300000370	Go! Go! Go!
FO300000371	Move out!
FO300000372	Go find your fortune somewhere else, merc. We'll take care of this ourselves.
FO300000373	If you're not going to help, just stay out of the way.
FO300000374	Stranger, I thank you for your aid. We must press forward, if you are willing to aid us, you are welcome to join us.
FO300000375	Speak with Paladin Hoss.
FO300000376	Well lookit this! We got us a wanderer all the way out here in Will'im's Wharf! You mus' got some import'int bus'ness out here to be wandrin' around.
FO300000377	But, 'taint none of my beeswax what yer doin'. But if yer interested in tradin', maybe we can help each other.
FO300000378	You again! Y'all interested in tradin' this time?
FO300000379	'Lurks ain't got ya yet, I see. You need some tradin'?
FO300000380	Watch out, there's a 'Guai den to the north. I'd steer clear of it if I were you.
FO300000381	Be very very quiet. They can hear you coming a mile away.
FO300000382	You've got some serious stones walking through here by yourself.
FO300000383	Shh! You're gonna scare away the 'Guai.
FO300000384	You showed up at a bad time, stranger. This position is being overrun.
FO300000385	I suggest that you head out of here while the Muties are focused on us.
FO300000386	Why are you still here? I said go!
FO300000387	Jesus, they just came out of nowhere...
FO300000388	I thought I was about to be written into the scrolls, but we live to fight another day.
FO300000389	Let there be no doubt: the might of the Brotherhood prevails.
FO300000390	So long as my brothers stand by my side, there can be no defeat.
FO300000391	What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?
FO300000392	What?
FO300000393	Just stumbled into town? You sure picked a fine day for it, with the crazies out there. Here, have a drink on the house. Welcome to Canterbury.
FO300000394	I'm Joe Porter. I make sure folks around here can get a meal when they need it.
FO300000395	What's up?
FO300000396	Newcomer to town, huh? Well, I'm Dominic D'Ellsadro, and welcome to Canterbury Commons. Try to ignore the idiots in the costumes.
FO300000397	Popular activities around town are trading, listening to Roe yap, and burying thieves in unmarked graves.
FO300000398	Course, we ran out of thieves to bury long ago. Saw to it myself. Might be a dead art, unless you're planning on stealing anything.
FO300000399	Staying out of trouble? Good, good.
FO300000400	Ah, new in town? Welcome to Canterbury Commons, home of traders, home of caravaners, and most of all, home of excellent bargains!
FO300000401	I'm Ernest Roe, but feel free to think of me as your jolly old Uncle Roe. What brings you to my fine, little town? Here for business, or pleasure?
FO300000402	With all of that fighting, I never got to give you the official welcome to the town, did I?
FO300000403	Welcome to Canterbury Commons, home of traders, caravaners, and most of all, of excellent bargains! Here for business or pleasure?
FO300000404	What can old Uncle Roe do for you, today?
FO300000405	Go away! I hate you!
FO300000406	Oh, um, hey. You're new here, right? I'm Derek. I do odd jobs around town, nothing important.
FO300000407	You'd probably rather talk to my uncle, Ernest Roe. He can give you the official welcome and everything.
FO300000408	Umm, yes?
FO300000409	Ah, a fellow student on the path of the Wasteland! Welcome to my humble caravan. Please relax, for we are in a place of safety!
FO300000410	The type of safety that can only be ensured by an abundance of weaponry, both wicked and awesome. All of which, can be yours, for the right price!
FO300000411	I hear you're my mysterious investor! With your help, I've collected quite a few toys for myself. But what good are toys if they aren't played with?
FO300000412	Thanks to you I have so many, I could hardly play with them all. So, I present to you a prize of the collection, a micro-nuke. Enjoy it in safety!
FO300000413	Here to shop? Have a look!
FO300000414	Welcome, sir or madam, to Crazy Wolfgang's Traveling Junk Store! The Depot of Detritus, the Shop of Slop, and the Caravan of Crap!
FO300000415	Now, what odds and ends can I, the Craziest of all possible Wolfgangs offer to you?
FO300000416	I hear you're the one who's so deeply invested in my junk. Not as deeply as me, of course, but who is, really?
FO300000417	I picked up some Stealth Boys the other day, and they seemed like just the way to thank you for your investment. Kudos!
FO300000418	A friend with deep pockets is a friend indeed! Welcome to my shop!
FO300000419	Hey, hey! Looking to buy?
FO300000420	Ah, welcome weary traveler! You look like a traveler in need of relaxation and the finest of chemical assistance.
FO300000421	Well, wander no more, my good friend, for I am Doc Hoff, procurer of the finest of medical goods and chemical assistance. Now, how may I help you?
FO300000422	My investor arrives at last. This line of work doesn't allow for much sentiment, but how could I not offer you some material token of my thanks?
FO300000423	Looking for your fix? You came to the right man.
FO300000424	Here to see the good doctor? Excellent.
FO300000425	Welcome, welcome! My name is Crow, and I travel the land, offering vestments of protection. And you are fortunate I found you in time!
FO300000426	You bear the look of one who is haunted, but I am proud to say that my wares can protect you from even the cruel claws of death itself. Have a look.
FO300000427	And here you are! The spirits have blessed me with many gifts, but you have given the more marketable gift of monetary investment.
FO300000428	Searching for a friend out in the Wastes? No one is more reliable than a cold, hard skin of steel.
FO300000429	Here to acquire a new mantle of metal or mesh? If you have the caps, I have the merchandise.
FO300000430	I'm just here to protect the merchandise.
FO300000431	Keep it on the level, and everything'll be fine.
FO300000432	Looking to trade?
FO300000433	Looking for that special something?
FO300000434	Well, hello there. I assume that you've come about the contract that we're offering.
FO300000435	We're always pleased to see a new associate. Welcome. A most hearty welcome to our little business.
FO300000436	You may darken our doorstep at any time, so long as you bring me what I ask for.
FO300000437	Welcome! Welcome back! What do you have for us today?
FO300000438	Why look who it is! My favorite associate! Have you brought me what I need?
FO300000439	It's you! We always have time for our favorite employee!
FO300000440	Speak to Mr. Littlehorn.
FO300000441	We can't help you. Only Mr. Littlehorn can help you.
FO300000442	I'm sorry, I don't have time to talk to you.
FO300000443	Busy. So busy. Busy busy bee.
FO300000444	The AntAgonizer! You're the awesomest person ever, ever! Can I have your autograph?
FO300000445	The Mechanist! You're the awesomest person ever, ever! Can I have your autograph?
FO300000446	Goodbye, AntAgonizer! I have to go home now!
FO300000447	Goodbye, Mechanist! I have to go home now!
FO300000448	I'm heading back to Rivet City to get more supplies to sell to Big Town. They bought out my entire stock!
FO300000449	I’m headed to Big Town. There’s good money to be made there. They ordered a ton of supplies, and now that it’s safe, I’m heading up there!
FO300000450	I’m headed to Big Town. There’s good money to be made there. They ordered a bunch of high power explosives!
FO300000451	I’m headed to Big Town. There’s good money to be made there. They ordered a bunch of robot parts!
FO300000452	I’m headed to Big Town. There’s good money to be made there. They ordered a few Stealth Boys.
FO300000453	I’m headed to Big Town. There’s good money to be made there. They ordered a bunch of firepower.
FO300000454	I'm heading up to Big Town to see what's left for the taking. I heard everyone up there was either killed or dragged off by Super Mutants.
FO300000455	Go away. I've had enough of your "help" already.
FO300000456	Hey, what happened with the robot?
FO300000457	Oh, hey there. Do you need something?
FO300000458	Thanks for your help, friend. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't come along.
FO300000459	Hello, again. How about that robot, huh?
FO300000460	I can't travel yet, but I'll be back on my feet soon, thanks to you. I never expected help from a stranger in the Wasteland.
FO300000461	Good to see you again, friend!
FO300000462	We could use some help here! It came out of nowhere!
FO300000463	That thing would have killed us all without your help. Thanks.
FO300000464	Listen, you may as well take this map. That's where we were headed, but that Deathclaw cured me of my itch for Wasteland adventure.
FO300000465	You'll stay out of this if you know what's good for you. We found that water and we're keeping it.
FO300000466	I hope you're not here for that water. Because we're leaving with it, and my mama never taught me to share.
FO300000467	Thanks for the help. A deal's a deal. Here's your water.
FO300000468	You've got what you came for. Why don't you move on? I'm not looking for any new friends at the moment.
FO300000469	Watch out! That scorpion won't let us near the water!
FO300000470	That thing won't let us near the water!
FO300000471	Help yourself to the water. You earned it.
FO300000472	Er, uh, hold it right there, pal. You're giving me everything you own. Um, now.
FO300000473	Er, uh, hold it right there, sister. You're giving me everything you own. Um, now.
FO300000474	I save your ass in the rotunda and you take the caps and glory, huh?
FO300000475	I'm not about to let you go bragging to anyone about retrieving the Declaration and leaving me in the dust.
FO300000476	It's alive! The Wasteland is reborn!
FO300000477	Allow me to introduce myself. I am Godfrey, your personal robotic butler.
FO300000478	I am here to look after your needs and to keep you happy and entertained.
FO300000479	What can I do for you?
FO300000480	Allow me to introduce myself. I am Wadsworth, your personal robotic butler.
FO300000481	I am here to look after your needs and to keep you happy and entertained.
FO300000482	What can I do for you?
FO300000483	Do not interfere with security operations.
FO300000484	I'm sorry, but I am not at liberty to chat right now.
FO300000485	Protect and serve.
FO300000486	What is it now? Sir.
FO300000487	What is it now? Ma'am.
FO300000488	Do I look like I have time for idle chitchat?
FO300000489	Ah! That's it. Tenpenny promised me safety and security. And that damn useless Gustavo lets thieves run amok. This is the last straw. I'm leaving.
FO300000490	Oooh! I can't believe it. With all of Gustavo's goons running around, they still let thieves come into my store and take things!
FO300000491	I thought I was safe here. That's it, I'm leaving. I'll try my luck elsewhere.
FO300000492	There must be somewhere safe out there.
FO300000493	Where will I go?
FO300000494	What brings you by Rivet City today?
FO300000495	Get the hell out of my face.
FO300000496	I have no interest in talking to you.
FO300000497	I figured we'd bump into each other again. What brings you all the way out to Ghoulsville?
FO300000498	So, what can I help with?
FO300000499	What's up?
FO300000500	Good luck to you, and Godspeed.
FO300000501	Saints alive! You've done it!
FO300000502	Quickly, let me have the ink and I will produce the copy of the Declaration of Independence!
FO300000503	What are the next orders from the Congress?
FO300000504	Have you reached a decision? Will you assist me in forging a copy of the Declaration?
FO300000505	If you have something to say, be quick about it or begone.
FO300000506	You've breached our defenses, evaded our best soldiers and you've raided my home.
FO300000507	But I have not yet begun to fight! I cannot allow you to steal our freedom!
FO300000508	The Declaration must remain here! It is our symbol of hope, the one thing that cries out "We are a free nation"!
FO300000509	Screw you! If you think you can get the Declaration by yourself, then have at it.
FO300000510	I'll be sure and leave flowers on your grave. If they find what's left of your corpse.
FO300000511	What's up?
FO300000512	Whew. Say, you're pretty decent in a firefight.
FO300000513	Well, come to a decision?
FO300000514	You made enough noise coming in here to wake the dead, for God's sakes!
FO300000515	Just be ready, the Muties are coming!
FO300000516	I can't wait to add the Declaration to the Society's collection.
FO300000517	I'm expecting great things from you!
FO300000518	What wonderful artifacts have you brought me?
FO300000519	So, have you decided to become a part of history and triumphantly return with the Declaration of Independence in hand?
FO300000520	Pleased to meet you. Abraham Washington's the name. I am curator of the Capital Preservation Society.
FO300000521	If you have time, come take a look at our exhibits.
FO300000522	Sorry, very busy right now. Come see me at the museum.
FO300000523	Quite an impressive collection, isn't it? Well don't be shy, have a look around.
FO300000524	What can I help you with?
FO300000525	No students in Hall without Pass.  Visitors must sign in at Administration.
FO300000526	Finally! Free!
FO300000527	I have to get out of here!
FO300000528	Please! Help us!
FO300000529	Why bother?
FO300000530	Where could we go even if we did escape? We'd just die in the Wasteland.
FO300000531	Get out of my head! Get the FUCK OUT! Aaaaagh!
FO300000532	Can't you SEE?! They're all dead! It's all my fault!
FO300000533	Deciding to retrieve the device yourself was foolish when I was at your disposal, but so be it.
FO300000534	Well, I'm afraid this is where you and I part company. I'll find my way out of this place, don't worry.
FO300000535	Maybe we'll meet again somewhere in the Wasteland.
FO300000536	Yes? What is it?
FO300000537	As promised, here's the G.E.C.K. I hope it's worth it.
FO300000538	Well, I'm afraid this is where you and I part company. I'll find my way out of this place, don't worry.
FO300000539	Maybe we'll meet again somewhere in the Wasteland.
FO300000540	I'm amazed by your bravado. The G.E.C.K. must be quite valuable to you.
FO300000541	I advise you to wait for me outside the irradiated area.
FO300000542	Accompanying me could prove quite fatal to you, my foolish friend.
FO300000543	Okay. You stay here. Beyond this door, the hallways and chambers are flooded with radiation.
FO300000544	I'll get the case and bring it right back. Keep your eyes open, many of my lesser-minded brethren are bound to stumble across us.
FO300000545	What did you need?
FO300000546	Now, for my part of the bargain. Follow me.
FO300000547	Is there something amiss? The door still seems to be sealed.
FO300000548	Look, we both know you're here to obtain the G.E.C.K. Why don't we stop this charade and work together?
FO300000549	It can't be!
FO300000550	Either you are quite real, or I am going quite mad.
FO300000551	Could you actually be a pure human?
FO300000552	Back so soon? What is it now? Come to gawk at the caged animal?
FO300000553	You've got the authority to kill Zimmer. None of my people will interfere. What's the hold up?
FO300000554	Zimmer's dead. I know. Now he's just another bad memory from my past.
FO300000555	You again? You better not be here to convince me I'm some kind of robot. I'm warning you. I won't put up with your nonsense.
FO300000556	I'm a little busy right now. Is there a problem?
FO300000557	There's nothing more to discuss. Now, run along.
FO300000558	The sooner you find my property, the sooner I can get out of this slum. Really, how do you people live like this?
FO300000559	Standing around all day chit-chatting isn't going to help you track down my android. Is it?
FO300000560	What?!
FO300000561	Ah, I trust you have reconsidered and wish to assist with the retrieval of my android?
FO300000562	No time to talk to your type, local.
FO300000563	Why don't you go bother the Brotherhood or something?
FO300000564	Hey local, shouldn't you be banging rocks together, or something?
FO300000565	Don't push your luck out here.
FO300000566	Keep an eye out for those locals.
FO300000567	All four of the VIP targets Eulogy wants are dead. Great. Good job moron. I'm sure you had something to do with that.
FO300000568	Well, you can keep sending slaves my way if you want to continue splitting the commission. But I'm not vouching for you with the Paradise crew.
FO300000569	Thanks to you, we finally have that sniper, Arkansas, in a collar! You have no idea how many good men that prick put into the dirt.
FO300000570	I'm tempted not to sell him, just so we can torment him. Use him for target practice or something. Hehehe.
FO300000571	Here's another collar. Keep those hoochies rolling in and you'll be rich in no time.
FO300000572	How the hell'd you get old queen Flak, into that collar?! I'm surprised you're still alive!
FO300000573	We need to keep a close eye on that one, though. He knows our system too well.
FO300000574	He sold us out to get into Rivet City. We'll never forget that. And now we'll make sure he never forgets it, either.
FO300000575	Here's another collar. Keep herding the swine in here and you'll have more bottle caps than you'll know what to do with.
FO300000576	I've been wanting to get Red in here for a long time. I have a little something special planned for her.
FO300000577	Take another collar, and keep those puppies coming!
FO300000578	Susan thought she could just up and leave, huh? We showed her different, didn't we?
FO300000579	She'll think twice about slitting one of our throats now that she's collared! We'll need to come up with something extra special for her.
FO300000580	Here's another collar. You're a welcome addition to our little operation here.
FO300000581	Hold it right there. Nobody's allowed into Paradise Falls except on Slaver business. And I get to decide what qualifies as Slaver business.
FO300000582	You didn't really think you could just sneak into Paradise Falls did you?
FO300000583	You again? What do you want?
FO300000584	What the hell do YOU want?! You got a death wish?
FO300000585	Do I look like someone who wants to be your friend? Are you a moron? Why do you keep coming around? Piss off already!
FO300000586	Unless, have you changed your mind? Do you want to take me up on the offer  of employment?
FO300000587	You're back?! Do you have a death wish?
FO300000588	I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't clear enough. Piss off. Go. Walk. Leave. You don't belong here. Au revoir. Don't let the door hit you in the ass.
FO300000589	Are you deaf? Get the hell out of here. You don't belong in this town.
FO300000590	I thought I told you to piss off. I did, didn't I? So piss off.
FO300000591	Expulsion Protocol KL-001 in effect. Disengage voice parameters.
FO300000592	Yes, fellow employee? What can I do for you on this wonderful day?
FO300000593	Hello there, fellow employee. I don't believe we've met. I'm your Factory Foreman, Milo. It's a pleasure to meet you.
FO300000594	Please give me your job posting title and employee registration number for my permanent records.
FO300000595	Hello again, fellow employee. I still have no record of your posting or employee identification.
FO300000596	Please give me your job posting title and employee registration number for my permanent records.
FO300000597	What do you want now? Come to make fun of me again?
FO300000598	If you're here with some Quantum, I have caps with your name on them!
FO300000599	Please, tell me you have some of the good stuff. I need that Quantum!
FO300000600	Oh! I hope you're here with some Quantum!
FO300000601	Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh! Did you find any Quantum?
FO300000602	Oh! Did you need something else?
FO300000603	Well? What do you think? Will you take my offer?
FO300000604	Before I get to the little proposition I have for you let me tell you a little bit about Nuka-Cola Quantum.
FO300000605	So, you ready to hear me out? I have a bit of a proposition for you.
FO300000606	But before I get to that, let me tell you a little bit about Nuka-Cola Quantum.
FO300000607	Hang on, the tour's not done yet. Be patient. Your Ice Cold Nuka-Cola is only moments away!
FO300000608	Sierra Petrovita's the name. Good to see a new face in Girdershade!
FO300000609	I take it you're here to check out my Nuka-Cola collection and take the tour?
FO300000610	Are you ready to take the tour of my collection?
FO300000611	Lemme go, beautiful! I'm gonna' get us some Quantum!
FO300000612	Bringing me some Quantum I hope?
FO300000613	My offer still stands. Bring me Quantum, and I'll pay you for it.
FO300000614	Hey, pal. What were you doing in Sierra's place?
FO300000615	So, who might you be and what brings you out to our little paradise?
FO300000616	Unless you want to hear what I have to say, we have nothing to discuss.
FO300000617	Thanks for helping us, mungo. You're not so bad for a mungo.
FO300000618	We're going home now. You watch out, okay?
FO300000619	Man, that sure was something. You're pretty brave, mungo!
FO300000620	We can make it from here, no problem. But you watch your back. Those Slaver assholes aren't going to forget about you.
FO300000621	Thanks for getting us out of there, mungo. We're gonna head back home now.
FO300000622	I'd think twice about coming back here if I were you. These guys aren't going to forget you, y'know?
FO300000623	We'll meet you outside, if you can make it!
FO300000624	We'll meet you outside, if you can make it!
FO300000625	We'll meet you outside, if you can make it!
FO300000626	Oh geez, mungo! This is crazy!
FO300000627	We're gonna run for it. You come meet us outside if you make it!
FO300000628	Man, what a mess! Don't get yourself killed, mungo!
FO300000629	I already shorted out the fence system so our collars won't blow. I bet they won't even notice.
FO300000630	We're getting outta here!
FO300000631	You got the gate, huh? Okay, we're outta here!
FO300000632	Shoot a couple of those mungo ass-bag Slavers for me, will ya?
FO300000633	Man, you've made a mess. Go get 'em, mungo! Get that key!
FO300000634	I guess you decided to do this your own way, huh?
FO300000635	Well, now you've really done it. They're gonna kill you if they can, so you better kill them all first.
FO300000636	Get the key for the slave pen gate off of the boss mungo, or that Forty asshole. If you can unlock the gate, we'll make a run for it.
FO300000637	Oh man, they're gonna be mad at you! These Slaver guys are mean!
FO300000638	You gonna help, or what? Squirrel and Penny are still in there.
FO300000639	Well, I guess that's it. Thanks for getting us out of there, mungo.
FO300000640	We're going back home now. You ever come out that way, you stop and say hi. I'll tell Mayor not to shoot you okay?
FO300000641	Well, I guess that's it. Thanks for getting us out of there, mungo.
FO300000642	We're going back home now. You ever come out that way, you stop and say hi. I'll tell Mayor not to shoot you okay?
FO300000643	Not bad, mungo. Not bad at all.
FO300000644	I told you I had a good plan. It sure worked, didn't it? You ever need anything, you go see MacCready in Lamplight. He'll help you out.
FO300000645	Thanks, mungo.
FO300000646	Thanks for getting us out of there. If you ever need anything, you come see us.
FO300000647	Mayor will be nice to you. I'll make sure of it.
FO300000648	So you got us out of there, huh?
FO300000649	Not so bad for a mungo, I guess.
FO300000650	So, uhh. Thanks and stuff. We're gonna head home soon.
FO300000651	You need something, sugar?
FO300000652	What you want?
FO300000653	Thanks for getting me out of there. I owe you one.
FO300000654	Now you get back in there and make sure Penny stays safe. I'll try and contact her sometime, if I can. I need to lay low for a while.
FO300000655	Thanks for getting me out of there. I owe you one.
FO300000656	Listen, there are kids in there. You've gotta get them out too, if you can. Just be careful.
FO300000657	I'm gonna lay low for a while. As soon as they realize I'm gone, they're going to come looking for me. Thanks again.
FO300000658	I gotta get someplace safe.
FO300000659	What?
FO300000660	Who the hell are you?
FO300000661	You again. What are you doing?
FO300000662	Get outta here! They see me talking to you, I'm dead!
FO300000663	Is Rory safe yet?
FO300000664	You're the mungo that helped Sammy and Squirrel, aren't you?
FO300000665	Well I already told them, I'm not going anywhere. Not without Rory.
FO300000666	Just leave me alone. I don't care about stupid escape plans. We're stuck here for good.
FO300000667	So what's the deal, mungo?
FO300000668	So what's the deal, mungo?
FO300000669	I ain't supposed to say anything. Sammy says so.
FO300000670	Nice going, mungo. Let's go before they change their minds.
FO300000671	Sammy says not to talk to you.
FO300000672	I guess we can go home now. Let's go.
FO300000673	Well, I guess this is one way to do it. We could've escaped, you know.
FO300000674	What the hell, lady? We're not going anywhere with you! You don't own us!
FO300000675	What the hell, mister? We're not going anywhere with you! You don't own us!
FO300000676	If we're going to leave, then let's get it over with.
FO300000677	Well, well. The budding entrepreneur returns!
FO300000678	Now see? This is what I want for the world. For men and women to make their own way, find their own paths to success.
FO300000679	What can Paradise Falls do for you today?
FO300000680	You must be our prospective customer. I do hope Paradise Falls can accommodate your needs.
FO300000681	We make no judgments, no assumptions. We understand that it's a harsh world out there, and you do what you must to make it.
FO300000682	Now, was there something specific you were interested in?
FO300000683	I'm busy, so piss off. You got business here, you talk to Eulogy.
FO300000684	We got a reason to be talkin' I ain't aware of?
FO300000685	I thought we was pretty clear about our relationship.
FO300000686	See, here's how it goes: you stay the hell outta my way, and I don't shoot you in the face. Seems clear to me.
FO300000687	Funny that you're still talkin', when I'm pretty sure I told you to get lost.
FO300000688	So you gonna take care of that guard, or what?
FO300000689	My hands are tied here. It's not like I want to be working with a mungo like you, but I got no choice. Come on.
FO300000690	You're the mungo that's helping us, huh?
FO300000691	Sammy says you want to know the plan. Well listen up, mungo, because it's a good one. I'm super smart.
FO300000692	What's up, mungo? You fixed that terminal yet?
FO300000693	Come on, mungo. You gonna fix that terminal, or what?
FO300000694	Hey, mister. Can you get us out of here?
FO300000695	Hey, lady. Can you get us out of here?
FO300000696	So, you getting us free or what?
FO300000697	Oh God, mister. You gotta help us. You gotta get us out of here!
FO300000698	Oh God, lady. You gotta help us. You gotta get us out of here!
FO300000699	You gotta help. You just gotta.
FO300000700	I can't keep talking to you, or else he'll shoot me.
FO300000701	Leave me out of that girl's crazy experiments. I don't get paid enough for that.
FO300000702	I'm just here to make sure nothing goes wrong. With you or her.
FO300000703	This place is a whole lot quieter, now. Thanks, I guess.
FO300000704	I got nothing to say to you.
FO300000705	Could you come back in an hour or two? Even geniuses need their sleep.
FO300000706	Well, whaddya know? It worked! I mean, I was pretty sure it would, obviously.
FO300000707	Here, take a few radiation Chems with you. I'm sure you'll run into more in the future.
FO300000708	Here, take a few radiation Chems, as my little way of saying, "I'm sorry I twisted your DNA like a kitten with a ball of yarn."
FO300000709	No mess, no problem! Well, a bit of a mess. But no problem, regardless!
FO300000710	Here. You know, for next time you get hurt, and I'm not around.
FO300000711	Okay, I even stitched a little smiley-face in you, to keep up your spirits. It's kind of hard to see from your side, though.
FO300000712	Here, take this environment suit of mine. It will help with medical tasks, and it should help prevent the effects of exposure, too.
FO300000713	Hey, I hear you're that stray from the Vault! I haven't seen one of you for years!
FO300000714	Good to meet you! I'm Moira Brown. I run Craterside Supply, but what I really do is mostly tinkering and research.
FO300000715	Hey! Is that you?
FO300000716	Hey, new in town? Good to meet you! I'm Moira Brown. I take care of supplies and repairs here, but what I really do is mostly tinkering and research.
FO300000717	Actually, right now I'm working on a book to help the world. And I could use a bit of help. I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300000718	So, how's the scavving been? Got the food and medicine from that Super-Duper Mart?
FO300000719	Oh? Feeling a bit under the weather? Or a bit over the Geiger-counter?
FO300000720	How are those hot little potatoes?
FO300000721	Anyway, what's up?
FO300000722	How are those hot little potatoes? Or whatever. You know what I mean.
FO300000723	Oh, I can't wait to hear how the repellent's working!
FO300000724	So, are they intelligent? Do they have a leader? Some sort of king? Or priests? Or some sort of scaly community center?
FO300000725	Well, how do you feel?
FO300000726	Any luck finding out how Rivet City got started?
FO300000727	Fiddle with any interesting technology, lately?
FO300000728	Is it there? Are there books? Can I go borrow some?
FO300000729	Oh, hey! Kinda busy here, but I guess I can talk for a bit. What's up?
FO300000730	Huh. Did you know the human body can survive without the stomach or spleen? Oh, what's up?
FO300000731	You know, I think I've found a new way to prepare Radroach meat. Still tastes like old feet, though. Anyway, what's up with you?
FO300000732	Oh, hey! Watch your step, I think one of my test subjects got loose. But don't worry, it's probably harmless.
FO300000733	Hey, don't mind the smell. I was just testing a few chemicals, but it's perfectly safe to breathe. Really!
FO300000734	What's up? Anything interesting out there in the wild Wasteland?
FO300000735	How's it going out there in the Wastes?
FO300000736	I guess it's my turn to thank you.
FO300000737	Anyway, the area's secure, so you're free to talk to Three Dog if you need to.
FO300000738	By the way, because you helped us I'm going to let you wear that Power Armor. But don't you ever forget where it came from.
FO300000739	I guess it's my turn to thank you.
FO300000740	Anyway, the area's secure, so you're free to talk to Three Dog if you need to.
FO300000741	Look, I don't know who you are but you don't belong here.
FO300000742	The Super Mutants have overrun our brothers at the Galaxy News Radio building, and we're headed there to back them up.
FO300000743	You can follow us as far as GNR. But keep your head down if you don't want it to get blown off.
FO300000744	No offense, but I'm a little busy saving your ass right now.
FO300000745	Go away.
FO300000746	Welcome, friend. My brothers may be gruff but they will lay down their lives for you.
FO300000747	You don't need to worry. We're the best outfit in the whole Brotherhood of Steel. Just watch what we do to these Uglies.
FO300000748	Colin Moriarty, at your service! Welcome to Moriarty's! My saloon, my home, my slice of heaven in this backwoods little burg.
FO300000749	If you've got the caps, I've got your pleasure. Please, sit down, make yourself comfortable. Your troubles are a thing of the past.
FO300000750	I'm the owner and proprietor of Moriarty's, you see. The saloon?
FO300000751	But, please! See for yourself! Come by for a drink or twelve. You and I, oh, we're going to be fast friends. Fast friends!
FO300000752	What is it I can do for you?
FO300000753	What's it to be? A few caps to find out where your father went? Or are you going to have a go of it on your own?
FO300000754	No luck finding dear old dad? Can't say it surprises me. Wasteland's a big place. Maybe you need a drink.
FO300000755	You're still standing here, and I can't think why. You know where your father went. Seems to me you ought to be out searching the Wastes.
FO300000756	Whoa!!! Is it me, or is the world spinning?
FO300000757	Who are you again?
FO300000758	I don't want to be a slave! I was just confused before! Take it off!
FO300000759	Please! You got to let me go!
FO300000760	I'm begging you! Let me go!
FO300000761	You enjoy being a "recruiter" for Paradise Falls, eh? Here's another collar and some caps.
FO300000762	The slaves keep rolling in. Keep this up and you're going to be rich! Here's your caps and another collar.
FO300000763	Tallied the last slave you sent us. You're pretty good at the slaving thing. Keep it up! Here's another collar and pile of caps.
FO300000764	Keep it up. We all make a ton of caps on every slave you send to us. Here's your cut and another collar.
FO300000765	You idiot! Your slave's dead. You ruined perfectly good merchandise. I monitor the collars, you know. You need to be more careful!
FO300000766	Do you want another collar and try again? You'll have to buy it. I'm not going to subsidize your screwups.
FO300000767	Idiot. You don't make money on dead slaves. You want to buy another collar and try again?
FO300000768	Hold it right there.
FO300000769	State your business in Rivet City.
FO300000770	Please be seated in the nearest available Tranquility Lounger. Thank you for your cooperation.
FO300000771	Please take a seat in the Tranquility Lounger.
FO300000772	Welcome to Vault 112, Resident! According to sensors, you have arrived 202.3 years behind schedule.
FO300000773	Please re-dress in your Vault-Tec issued Vault suit before proceeding. If you have misplaced your suit, I am authorized to distribute a new one.
FO300000774	Once dressed, please proceed down the stairs to the main floor so that you may enter your assigned Tranquility Lounger.
FO300000775	Please dress in your Vault 112 suit. Remove all other articles of clothing to prevent damage to the equipment.
FO300000776	Thank you for your cooperation.
FO300000777	Please dress in your Vault 112 suit. Remove all other articles of clothing to prevent damage to the equipment.
FO300000778	Thank you for your cooperation.
FO300000779	I've already told you everything I know. I don't understand why you're still here.
FO300000780	You're James' son, aren't you? What are you doing here?
FO300000781	You're James' daughter, aren't you? What are you doing here?
FO300000782	President Rosie? What's happening around here anyway?
FO300000783	Well, now. President Bob. How do you like that? Boy, things are gonna change around here. First step: get rid of all this "Dave" shit.
FO300000784	The Kingdom of Bob! Or maybe Bobtopia! I'll have to give it some thought.
FO300000785	Take whatever you want out of there. Consider it a gift from your kind and loving President Bob.
FO300000786	Maybe we need a flag? One with my picture on it. That could be pretty cool.
FO300000787	Maybe we need a flag? One with my picture on it. That could be pretty cool.
FO300000788	First things first, we're gonna have to open up the Museum of Bob.
FO300000789	I've got nothing to say to you, stranger.
FO300000790	C'mon. Make it fast. I got chores.
FO300000791	Yes? What is it? C'mon, I don't have all day.
FO300000792	This is the new Republic of Dave! Go away!
FO300000793	By the order of the new Republic of Dave, I order you to go away! This is your last warning!
FO300000794	I warned you!
FO300000795	I guess you're wondering where I'm going. I'm off to annex Old Olney and forge the New Republic of Dave! Don't try to stop me!
FO300000796	Ah, you're back. So, have you brought a gift for the President? Which is it? The rifle or the money?
FO300000797	We have nothing more to talk about. Leave my republic within 24 hours or you will be executed for treason.
FO300000798	Breach! How did you make it in here without an escort? Only a master spy could be so skilled! Are you a spy?
FO300000799	You are, aren't you? Come on now, confess! Have you been sent to spy on the Republic of Dave?
FO300000800	I am Dave, President of the Republic of Dave. You will address me as "Mister President" or I will have you executed.
FO300000801	Now, are you applying for citizenship, asylum, or just vacationing in the Republic of Dave?
FO300000802	Hmmm. You look familiar. No matter. We never hold prior meetings against tourists.
FO300000803	Now, are you applying for citizenship, asylum, or just vacationing in the Republic of Dave?
FO300000804	Yeah? What do you want?
FO300000805	Oh, look at this, the spy has returned to gather intelligence. You'll get nothing from me, spy. What do you want?
FO300000806	Out with it, Ambassador. This Republic isn't going to run itself.
FO300000807	Yes? What can President Dave do for you?
FO300000808	Stop right there, mister!  Whatcha think you're doing in the Republic of Dave?
FO300000809	Stop right there, lady!  Whatcha think you're doing in the Republic of Dave?
FO300000810	Whatcha want, Stranger?
FO300000811	Come on! I have to take you to Daddy!
FO300000812	Dave says you're okay? Fine.
FO300000813	It's kind of late to be entering the Republic.
FO300000814	Can't you come back later?
FO300000815	Come on! I have to take you to Daddy!
FO300000816	Hey, you. Stop! What do you want from the Republic of Dave?
FO300000817	What do you want from us?
FO300000818	Come on! I have to take you to Daddy!
FO300000819	Hey, who are you?  What do you want from the Republic of Dave?
FO300000820	What do you want?
FO300000821	Did Dave say it was okay for you to be here?
FO300000822	Listen, I can't thank you enough. You convinced that that I could do this, and you were right. I want you to have something.
FO300000823	Dave kept some big weapon or something locked up in the safe in his office. The code is 1138.
FO300000824	It's yours if you want it. We don't need it anymore.
FO300000825	I just can't thank you enough!
FO300000826	Things are going to be different around here!
FO300000827	I heard that Dave allowed you to stay. Well, welcome stranger. Just be mindful of the children.
FO300000828	Who are you?  Is it okay for you to be here?
FO300000829	What do you want now?
FO300000830	Come on! I have to take you to Daddy!
FO300000831	So Dave gave you the okay, huh?  Well, welcome then.
FO300000832	I run the Museum of Dave, where the children of the Republic can learn about their heritage.
FO300000833	I have nothing more to say to you. You are the most un-Dave-like person I've ever met!
FO300000834	Something you need?
FO300000835	Dave doesn't like us talking to strangers.
FO300000836	President Daddy says that people from outside the Republic are bad.
FO300000837	Are you really from the Wasteland? Wooooow!
FO300000838	This ain't a tourist trap. You civilians get topside immediately!
FO300000839	We need to get this resolved, and fast. We're too exposed like this. We need to keep moving.
FO300000840	What the hell are we standing around for? If Garza can't make it, then we need to go without him. This is crazy!
FO300000841	All right, you should be just outside the pipe that's been giving us trouble.
FO300000842	Now don't worry, this isn't dangerous at all.
FO300000843	Just get inside and use the manual controls to drain the pipe. That'll break up the debris enough for the filters to function properly.
FO300000844	Get to the museum level and use the intercom there. I'll talk you through cycling the airlock on the intake pipe.
FO300000845	There are a few minor repairs still to be made up here in the control room. Why don't you come back here and give me a hand?
FO300000846	Actually, wait. There's one other thing I need you to do. Janice says there's a blockage in one of the intake pipes.
FO300000847	It's on your way back; head back up to the museum level and give me a call on the intercom when you get there.
FO300000848	Well, you've done it. It'll just be a few minutes until we can access the mainframe. Use the intercom so I can tell you where to go next.
FO300000849	There are a few minor repairs still to be made up here in the control room. Why don't you come back here and give me a hand?
FO300000850	Actually, wait. There's one other thing I need you to do. Janice says there's a blockage in one of the intake pipes.
FO300000851	It's on your way back; head back up to the museum level and give me a call on the intercom when you get there.
FO300000852	With the fuses in place, you should be able to access the mainframe. No need to come back to the control room; just head right there.
FO300000853	Great work on the pumps. Hurry back and I'll give you the fuses you'll need.
FO300000854	How are you holding up? Need directions?
FO300000855	Everything all right?
FO300000856	You're doing great out there. Keep it up.
FO300000857	This isn't what I had in mind when I came back here.
FO300000858	Thank God someone else made it out. What the hell is going on? Who are those guys? Did I hear gunshots?
FO300000859	We'll make it out of here, right? I don't want to die down here.
FO300000860	After all that, you just kill the man? What is wrong with you?
FO300000861	You monster! How could you do that to him!
FO300000862	I am sorry. I cannot continue. I need to rest for a while.
FO300000863	Now is not a good time to be talking.
FO300000864	I can't leave Garza here in this condition. We're not going anywhere until he's been helped.
FO300000865	We can't go any further. We need to stop.
FO300000866	What is it?
FO300000867	Don't wander off. We're going to need you.
FO300000868	We have to make it to the tunnel. Follow me, and stay quiet!
FO300000869	Didn't your dad tell you about the blockage? I thought you'd be off taking care of that now.
FO300000870	You really should go fix that blockage before something bad happens.
FO300000871	Just be careful what you touch in here, okay? The equipment's old enough as it is.
FO300000872	So you're going to make sure it's safe for us in there? That's really brave of you.
FO300000873	This is kind of exciting, isn't it? I've always heard Doctor Li talk about Project Purity, but I never thought I'd be going there.
FO300000874	Well, at least now we're not completely doomed. Thanks for taking care of those beasts.
FO300000875	I'm sure it's not safe in there, but how safe is it for us to be standing around out here?
FO300000876	I don't know if I like this. I understand it's important to Doctor Li, but isn't going to Project Purity dangerous?
FO300000877	I thank you for risking your life to make sure we are safe.
FO300000878	Now we must worry about mutants as well? Perhaps we should have stayed at Rivet City.
FO300000879	I am unsure how useful I will be at this Purity Project, but I am happy to do whatever I can to help Doctor Li.
FO300000880	Oh, great.
FO300000881	Listen, I know who you are, okay? Far as I'm concerned, you've got no business being here. So just stay out of my way.
FO300000882	Yeah, what do you want?
FO300000883	Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you go worry about whatever it is you're supposed to be doing, and leave me alone.
FO300000884	Hey there. I hear we have you to thank for getting us up and running again!
FO300000885	Hey there, little lady. What's going on?
FO300000886	Hey there, bud. What's going on?
FO300000887	We have to get out of here. They'll be coming for us next. We've got to evacuate now!
FO300000888	What is he doing in there?
FO300000889	I've been hearing good things about you.
FO300000890	Is it true? Did you really disarm the bomb in Megaton?
FO300000891	I think we need to talk.
FO300000892	I know there's a lot going on right now. This is all very sudden.
FO300000893	I just want you to know that I'm here if you want to talk. You seem troubled, like there's a cloud hanging over you.
FO300000894	I know there's a lot going on right now. This is all very sudden.
FO300000895	It's essential that you get to the pipes as soon as you can. We can't allow the pressure to build up, or it could be a disaster.
FO300000896	I'll be here for you when you get back.
FO300000897	Please, hurry. Once the blockage is cleared up, we'll be in good shape.
FO300000898	I'll be here for you when you get back.
FO300000899	You didn't have to come all the way back here, you know. You could've just gone right to the mainframe.
FO300000900	Replace those fuses. Otherwise we'll never get the doors open, and there's no chance of getting the mainframe running.
FO300000901	So the pumps are working, and some of the doors are opened. We're making progress.
FO300000902	Problem is that the water shorted out a few key fuse boxes. Here, take these fuses and replace the ones that have burnt out.
FO300000903	Once you get the Flood Control Pumps activated, that'll clear out some of the water and make it easier for us to see what else has gone wrong.
FO300000904	Let's get to the control room and assess the situation. We can talk more there.
FO300000905	Are you all right? Is it safe in there?
FO300000906	We can't accomplish anything until we can get inside, but none of us are particularly capable fighters.
FO300000907	I hate to ask you to put yourself in harm's way, but you seem to have learned to handle yourself.
FO300000908	I need you to go in and make sure it's safe for Doctor Li and her crew.
FO300000909	I still need your help. I can't do this without you, you know.
FO300000910	Here we are. Where it all began. You remember your mother's favorite passage?
FO300000911	Revelation 21:6. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life, freely.
FO300000912	Don't you see? This is what it all means. The water, the purifier. THIS is the water of life. Your mother's dream.
FO300000913	No point in wasting time. Let's get to work. There's much to be done.
FO300000914	I'm not trying to put you off, but we need to get to Project Purity. Anything else can wait until later.
FO300000915	We need to get back to Project Purity. The computer there is our best chance to locate a G.E.C.K.
FO300000916	Give me a few moments to speak with Madison. Then we can decide on a course of action. Have patience.
FO300000917	Yeah? You need something?
FO300000918	You found him! I can't believe it!
FO300000919	You have my thanks. We would be lost without James.
FO300000920	What can I do for you?
FO300000921	If you're here to talk to him, I'm afraid he's come and gone. The last I knew, he was headed back to the lab.
FO300000922	If you're here to talk to him, I'm afraid he's come and gone. The last I knew, he was headed back to the lab.
FO300000923	Good to see you again, honey.
FO300000924	Good to see you again, son.
FO300000925	What do you need?
FO300000926	I need to reach Madison as soon as possible. Now I can make her see that Project Purity is worth finishing.
FO300000927	Well, hi there! Welcome to Andale! I'm Willy Wilson, though folks just call me Bill. Is there anything I can do for you?
FO300000928	Well, hello again! How can the Wilson clan help you today?
FO300000929	Hooeee, smell that air! Ain't nothing like it, is there?
FO300000930	And what can I do for you on this fine day?
FO300000931	By God, it's another fine day in Andale!
FO300000932	Hey there, stranger. I've got something that I want to talk to you about.
FO300000933	I couldn't help but notice that you were poking around in Bill's shed.
FO300000934	So, did you find what you were looking for in there?
FO300000935	Hey there, stranger. I've got something that I want to talk to you about.
FO300000936	I couldn't help but notice that you're poking around in my basement.
FO300000937	So, be honest now, You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
FO300000938	Hello there, fellah! Good to meet you! Name's Smith, Jack Smith. Welcome to Andale, the best little town in Virginia!
FO300000939	Hello there, young lady! Good to meet you! Name's Smith, Jack Smith. Welcome to Andale, the best little town in Virginia!
FO300000940	Hello there, stranger! Good to meet you! Name's Jack Smith. I hear you've already met my wife. Sweet lady, isn't she?
FO300000941	But anyway, welcome to Andale, the best little town in Virginia!
FO300000942	Hey there, good to see you again!
FO300000943	Afternoon, friend!
FO300000944	Look at this weather, can you believe it?
FO300000945	Wouldn't Mr. Harris tell us if they were?
FO300000946	Mr Harris is nice to us, but he doesn't read the stories the same way that my daddy did.
FO300000947	We're eating all sorts of different food now. Before, we always just ate my mom's meat pies.
FO300000948	Hi! Welcome to Andale! I'm Jenny! You should probably talk to my dad, he likes to welcome all the new visitors!
FO300000949	Hi, again! How're you doing?
FO300000950	I'm not really sure what happened. Mr. Harris said that our parents went away, and they won't be back.
FO300000951	Mr. Harris is a lot like my dad. I never knew that he could be so nice.
FO300000952	You're new here, aren't you? Wow! I never get a chance to talk to the new people! Dad always takes care of them before I get a chance.
FO300000953	Hello again! Have you been out having adventures?
FO300000954	I wish I was like you, instead of stuck here in boring ol' Andale.
FO300000955	Oh man, I'm so jealous, you get to go out and do stuff outside of town and you probably don't even have a bedtime.
FO300000956	Well, hello! Welcome to Andale! Winner of the best town in the USA contest!
FO300000957	Oh. It's you again. Well, I don't want to be rude, so what do you want?
FO300000958	Oh. Hello. Do you need something, or are you here to tell me about your incredibly nice underground vault again?
FO300000959	Hmph. Well, I'm not as rude as you, so I'll politely ask you what you need.
FO300000960	Hello again! Stick around for a while, I'm thinking about making some meat cookies later! Isn't that exciting!
FO300000961	I'm so happy to see you! What do you need?
FO300000962	I'm a little busy right now, but never too busy for a friend! What did you want to talk about?
FO300000963	Why, hello there. I'd heard there was someone new coming. How can our little family help you?
FO300000964	Hello again! You know, I actually missed you! And I barely know who you are!
FO300000965	Busy busy busy, a wife's work is never done!
FO300000966	The only thing that I can do is try to raise these kids and make Andale into a decent place.
FO300000967	I'm not sure why you'd come back here, but I'm glad to see you.
FO300000968	Little by little, each day, I'm trying to clean up the mess my family left.
FO300000969	Get out of here! Run!
FO300000970	They're crazy! Crazy I tell you!
FO300000971	Get out of town while you still can!
FO300000972	What is it? Can't you see that I'm watching the guards?
FO300000973	What... huh? Me? You're talking to me? Yes? What do you need?
FO300000974	Hey... hey! You wanna hear a song? See a dance? Just gimme some booze, I'll make it happen!
FO300000975	Why, look at what we have here. Some fresh meat, right out of the Wastes!
FO300000976	You just wanna go ahead and jump into the pen with the others, or should I beat you senseless and drag you there myself?
FO300000977	Aww, look at you! You're such a cute lil' varmint.
FO300000978	I miss Eulogy...
FO300000979	Anything that I have to say, Mr. Eulogy can say for me.
FO300000980	Mr. Eulogy don't like me talking to the johnnies without his permission.
FO300000981	What do you want, square?
FO300000982	To tell you the truth, I'm glad that fool is dead.
FO300000983	Eulogy handles the business.
FO300000984	What? Do you see something you like?
FO300000985	Look, nothing personal, but if you need something, talk to the clown in the hat.
FO300000986	Keep staring and I'll start charging.
FO300000987	You're a mess. I hope you brought a lot of money with you.
FO300000988	Are you just going to bleed on me, or are you going to pay me to fix you?
FO300000989	I love the sight of a limping Waster. You just look like a walking pile of caps to me.
FO300000990	Well now, look at you limping in here like that. Did you bring some caps for Auntie Cutter?
FO300000991	Been in a few fights, have we? Well, that's why they pay me the big bucks...
FO300000992	Ain't nothing that I love more than an injured Slaver with more caps than sense. Hopefully, you fall into that category.
FO300000993	You look alright to me. Are you here for some supplies?
FO300000994	Hello there, my dear. What can Eulogy do for you today?
FO300000995	Just let me know if you need anything, and I'll do whatever I can to procure it.
FO300000996	If it's business you're here to discuss, I'm all ears.
FO300000997	What can I do for you? Paradise Falls is always open for business.
FO300000998	Something I can help you with?
FO300000999	<sighs>I'm sure that whatever you have to say is absolutely vital. So let's hear it.
FO300001000	What. Do. You. Want?
FO300001001	Look. I told you. My name's Forty. I'm not inclined to change it, so unless you've got something good to say, you'd best make it fast.
FO300001002	Jotun.
FO300001003	What?
FO300001004	Yes?
FO300001005	...
FO300001006	This place is terrible! Please! You've got to help us!
FO300001007	You need guns, I got guns. You need armor? Got that too. So long as you got the caps for 'em.
FO300001008	Guns, guns, and more guns. What do you need?
FO300001009	What? I guard the gate. That's all. What the fuck do you want from me?
FO300001010	Hey. Talk fast, they hate it when I talk to customers.
FO300001011	Haha! Hello! I am Ymir!
FO300001012	Haha! Good to see you again, little man! Have you come to drink with me?
FO300001013	Haha! Good to see you again, little girl! Have you come to drink with me?
FO300001014	Hey sorry, man. Let me get out of your way!
FO300001015	Whoa there. Easy, killer. I'm movin', I'm movin'!
FO300001016	Heard about you. You're some pretty slick shit.
FO300001017	Respect.
FO300001018	You look like a damn fool in that Vault Suit.
FO300001019	Nice! Did you get that monkey suit from the Brotherhood?
FO300001020	Sorry, bro. Got nothin' to say to you.
FO300001021	Sorry, chica. Got nothin' to say to you.
FO300001022	Keep walkin'.
FO300001023	I can't believe that Grouse let you in here.
FO300001024	Don't think I won't throw your ass in the pens with the rest of the meat.
FO300001025	You don't exactly look like you belong here.
FO300001026	Okay, seriously. Leave me alone.
FO300001027	*sniff* Smells like meat. Move on.
FO300001028	Hey, I've been wanting to talk to you. Leo told me what you said to him. You know, about his problem.
FO300001029	I just wanted to say thank you. I know I can be rough, but my little brother means the world to me and you may have saved his life.
FO300001030	If there's anything that I can ever help you with, just let me know.
FO300001031	Hey there, Leo's been doing a lot better. I think we have you to thank for that. How can I help you?
FO300001032	Leo's tickets have stopped coming up short ever since he gave up the chems. Me and my wallet both thank you. What can we do for you?
FO300001033	Can't a man eat in peace? Go talk to Jenny or Leo if you need something.
FO300001034	Look, I need to balance these books. If you'd like to order some food, please talk to Jenny or Leo.
FO300001035	Yep. Still balancing the books. Is there something exciting about watching me? Look: Go talk to Jenny or Leo.
FO300001036	You again. Is there something exciting about watching me? Look: Go talk to Jenny or Leo.
FO300001037	Hmm? Oh. I'm afraid I'm quite busy right now. If it's food you're after, talk to Jenny or Leo. Otherwise, I can't help you.
FO300001038	You again? Go Bother Jenny or Leo, will you?
FO300001039	Hooo weee! Look at you! Now I haven't seen one of those Vault jumpsuits in, wow, a LONG time.  Pretty damn good condition, too!
FO300001040	Name's Billy Creel. You call me Billy, all right? I know Megaton looks more like a boneyard than a town, but it ain't all bad.
FO300001041	Take me and Maggie, for instance. We make do just fine. I trade the stuff I scavenge, and she helps keep me on the straight and narrow. He he he.
FO300001042	Well hot damn! Someone new! Always a pleasure!
FO300001043	Name's Billy Creel. You call me Billy, all right? I know Megaton looks more like a boneyard than a town, but it ain't all bad.
FO300001044	Take me and Maggie, for instance. We make do just fine. I trade the stuff I scavenge, and she helps keep me on the straight and narrow. He he he.
FO300001045	Look, bud. It'd be best if you just drift on by and leave us alone.
FO300001046	Hey, man. What's going on?
FO300001047	Well now, if it ain't our local terror. You behave yourself this time, you hear?
FO300001048	I don't care what you do to these yokels, you just keep your brand of trouble far away from me.
FO300001049	Colin Moriarty, at your service! Welcome to Moriarty's! My saloon, my home, my little slice of heaven in this godforsaken little town!
FO300001050	Colin Moriarty. Always pleased to see a new face around here. I'm afraid you've had the misfortune to catch me, well... out of my element.
FO300001051	I'm the owner and proprietor of Moriarty's, you see. My saloon, my home, my little slice of heaven in this godforsaken little town!
FO300001052	But, I already know your face from that little stunt you pulled the other day. But no worries, all are welcome here.
FO300001053	Colin Moriarty. Always pleased to see a new face around here. I'm afraid you've had the misfortune to catch me, well... out of my element.
FO300001054	I'm the owner and proprietor of Moriarty's, you see. My saloon, my home, my little slice of heaven in this godforsaken little town!
FO300001055	Hello, hello. What is it I can do for you?
FO300001056	What's it to be? A few caps to find out where your father went? Or are you going to have a go of it on your own?
FO300001057	No luck finding dear old dad? Can't say it surprises me. Wasteland's a big place. Maybe you need a drink.
FO300001058	You're still standing here, and I can't think why. You know where your father went. Seems to me you ought to be out searching the Wastes.
FO300001059	If it isn't my favorite vault baby! What can I do for you?
FO300001060	And look who it is! What can this humble barkeep do for you?
FO300001061	Who have we here? Could it be? A new addition to our humble little community? Dear child, welcome! Welcome to Megaton!
FO300001062	I am Confessor Cromwell, prophet of Atom and father of the undying Glow. Please child, come to the Church any time. Any time at all!
FO300001063	I apologize, but I cannot talk now. Perhaps you'd like to take a seat and enjoy the sermon?
FO300001064	These are questions that none of us can answer in this life. Now, how may I help you?
FO300001065	It is so good to see you again, dear child! Remember, the Church of the Children of Atom is always here for you. Salvation IS attainable!
FO300001066	Have yourself a nice visit, partner.
FO300001067	Howdy, pard-ner. My name is Deputy Steel. How may I assist you?
FO300001068	Howdy ma'am, my name is Deputy Steel. How may I assist you?
FO300001069	I'm Doc Church and I run this clinic. Now, before you go askin' me for help, you'd better know the rules. Rule one: don't bother me.
FO300001070	If you do bother me, you better be damn near dead. I'm busy enough takin' care of people I actually like.
FO300001071	Follow my rule, I'll keep you patched up, I'll keep getting' paid, and we'll get along just fine.
FO300001072	Boy, you're glowin' like a goddamn reactor core. You need help?
FO300001073	Girl, you're glowin' like a goddamn reactor core. You need help?
FO300001074	Looks like you went and got yourself irradiated. Too bad for you, I'm off duty. Stop by the clinic in the morning.
FO300001075	What the hell are you standin' there bleedin' on my floor for? If you need help, then ask for it, dammit!
FO300001076	You came in here on your own power, so you must not be busted up too bad.
FO300001077	You'd best have cancer because from the looks of you, you're breaking rule number one right now.
FO300001078	For Christ's sake, you don't look sick and you sure as hell don't look dead, so why are you bothering me?
FO300001079	The Doctor is off duty. Go away.
FO300001080	Don't shoot! Please! Just tell me what you want!
FO300001081	Hey smoothskin, do you need something? A drink, maybe? Anything? Anything at all?
FO300001082	<sigh>What'll it be?
FO300001083	Oh, it's you. Would you like to slap me around before you drink? I'm told that it's a lot of fun.
FO300001084	Oh good. If it isn't my favorite smoothskin.
FO300001085	Hey, pal. What do you need?
FO300001086	Good to see you again! Need a drink?
FO300001087	Dad usually doesn't like when I talk to strangers.
FO300001088	Be careful, mister. My dad is right over there. Try anything, and I'll yell for him.
FO300001089	Be careful, lady. My dad is right over there. Try anything, and I'll yell for him.
FO300001090	We get people tryin' to settle down here all the time. Anyway, if you're hungry, you came to the right place. What can I get you?
FO300001091	Hey. What can I get you?
FO300001092	So what'll it be today? We've got some noodles. And the Brahmin steak is pretty good, too.
FO300001093	So what's it going to be?
FO300001094	Sorry man, I'm off the clock. Noodle time is over.
FO300001095	Sorry girl, I'm off the clock. Noodle time is over.
FO300001096	Oh, hey. Look, I'm not working right now.
FO300001097	The noodle stand is closed right now. If you need something, talk to Leo.
FO300001098	Long time, no see. You takin' care of yourself out there?
FO300001099	Been a while. You need something?
FO300001100	What's up?
FO300001101	Yeah? You want something?
FO300001102	This'd better be good. I'm in no mood for your shit.
FO300001103	Say what's on your mind then get out of my face.
FO300001104	How may I assist you?
FO300001105	Hi there! I'm Moira, it's a pleasure to meet you! I run Craterside Supply.
FO300001106	If there's anything you need, anything at all, I probably got it layin' around in here somewhere. Don't be afraid to ask!
FO300001107	Hey, you! What do you need?
FO300001108	Good to see you! Did you bring me any junk?
FO300001109	Well goddamn. You're new, right? I've got to admit, the outfit's a little weird, but that's okay, that's okay. Name's Leo Stahl. It's a pleasure!
FO300001110	Well goddamn. You're new, right?  Name's Leo Stahl. It's a pleasure! It's a pleasure! Yeah!
FO300001111	<sighs>It's you. I was hoping that you'd have moved on. What do you want?
FO300001112	Goddammit. Can't you leave me alone? What do you want?
FO300001113	Look, if you're going to tell on me, do it. Otherwise, tell me what you want and then get out of here.
FO300001114	Hey hey! Nice to see you! Everything okay? You doing all right? You need something? Come on, talk to me!
FO300001115	Alright! Good to see you again? What's new? Feel like having a drink? C'mon, let's talk!
FO300001116	Hey there, buddy! Good to see you!
FO300001117	Heya! How's it going?
FO300001118	You pull another stunt like you did, and you're finished in this town. Do you understand?
FO300001119	Now what do you want?
FO300001120	Yes?
FO300001121	Hey there.
FO300001122	Good to see you're staying out of trouble.
FO300001123	Got my eye on you. Don't do anything stupid.
FO300001124	Staying out of trouble, I hope? Don't want to have to waste good bullets on your sorry hide.
FO300001125	Yeah?
FO300001126	Hi, I'm Maggie. I live with Billy. Billy Creel. Do you know him? He's not my dad or anything, but he takes care of me now. Anyway, I should go. Bye.
FO300001127	I probably shouldn't be talking to you. Billy says I get too friendly with people I don't know. He says it's dangerous.
FO300001128	Hi there! How are you?
FO300001129	Well hey there, stranger! I'm Manya. The old coot wandering around here is my husband, Nathan.
FO300001130	If there's anything we can help you with, ask me. Don't ask Nathan, he'll just blabber at you about the damned Enclave all day.
FO300001131	I guess I'm not really over it. I'm not sure if I ever will be. Look, you have a good day, I need to go.
FO300001132	What do you need, honey?
FO300001133	If you see Nathan, tell that man to get his ass back home.
FO300001134	You seen Nathan anywhere around here?
FO300001135	Hello, sweet child. Hello. I don't believe we've met. I'm Mother Maya, prophet of the Atom and embracer of the universal Light.
FO300001136	Remember, sweet child, that as children of Atom, the fabric of the universe itself is ours to weave. So welcome to Megaton, and peace be with you.
FO300001137	Sweet child, now is not the time for talk. But you should join us now in our hour of prayer. Simply close thine eyes and bask in Atom's glow.
FO300001138	Well hello again, sweet child. Is all well with you? Remember, stay in the Glow and let all things take their course.
FO300001139	We meet again, sweet child. I hope you're finding our town agreeable? In darkness, in doubt, go ye to the bomb. Find Atom, and find truth.
FO300001140	Oh my, it divides my heart to see you again, sweet child. And what may Mother Maya do for you today?
FO300001141	Ha! Look at this! New blood! Tell me boy, you ever hear of the Enclave? The last remnant of the good ol' USA, they are!
FO300001142	Now, I don't know you from Adam, but I got you pegged for a patriot and any patriot worth his salt is gonna toss his gun in for the Enclave.
FO300001143	Ha! Look at this! New blood! Tell me girl, you ever hear of the Enclave? The last remnant of the good ol' USA, they are!
FO300001144	Now, I don't know you from Adam, but I got you pegged for a patriot and any patriot worth her salt is gonna toss her gun in for the Enclave.
FO300001145	Have you seen my wife anywhere around here?
FO300001146	Greetings, citizen!
FO300001147	Be all you can be. Support the Enclave.
FO300001148	Well, hello there, Miss Dangerous. What can I do for you?
FO300001149	Well, hello there Mister Dangerous. What can I do for you?
FO300001150	Hey, baby. What do you need?
FO300001151	What is it, hon?
FO300001152	Listen, I'm working right now. So make it quick, okay?
FO300001153	The more time I spend talking to you, the less I'm spending watching for Raiders.
FO300001154	How the hell did you get up here anyway?
FO300001155	Yeah? What is it?
FO300001156	What do you need?
FO300001157	I'm just here to guard the goods. That's all.
FO300001158	I'm here to watch over this stuff. Only touch what you've paid for, and we'll have no problem.
FO300001159	I've got my eye on you.
FO300001160	This place is so much better than Moriarty's. That place is just filled with scum.
FO300001161	Pull up a chair if you want.
FO300001162	Hey there, stranger. Talk to Leo if you need something.
FO300001163	Always good to see a new face.
FO300001164	Leo's a nice guy, a bit twitchy, but nice.
FO300001165	Don't mind Andy, he's just a busy guy.
FO300001166	Hello, Child. Have you come to bask in Atom's glow?
FO300001167	Speak to the Confessor or the Mother if you wish to know more.
FO300001168	The Confessor is truly the chosen of Atom.
FO300001169	Even those who are not dedicated Children of Atom may bask in his glow.
FO300001170	It's been so peaceful in here since Moriarty got killed.
FO300001171	Talk to Gob if you need something.
FO300001172	Can't I just drink in peace?
FO300001173	I'm in the mood to drink, not to talk.
FO300001174	Leave me alone.
FO300001175	It's not that kind of bar, stranger.
FO300001176	You looking to trade, stranger? Check out Craterside Supply.
FO300001177	Whatever you want, I don't have it.
FO300001178	Leave me alone! Someone might see us!
FO300001179	Don't let the people around here fool you with their hippie crap. They've got water they won't share with anyone. Nice, huh?
FO300001180	What? Why are you being so friendly? Go away!
FO300001181	Look, I don't want to be rude, but I don't trust strangers.
FO300001182	I hope they let me buy a house here some day.
FO300001183	I don't want any trouble.
FO300001184	What? No! Go away!
FO300001185	Take it up with someone else.
FO300001186	I came to this place looking for water, but they're only selling to residents.
FO300001187	Sorry, I'm a little busy right now. Maybe we can talk later, okay?
FO300001188	The people here get really paranoid when they see outsiders chatting to each other. Keep that in mind.
FO300001189	Sorry, can't talk now.
FO300001190	We've got nothing to say to each other.
FO300001191	What? You think you can walk around the Wasteland doing the evil that you do and there isn't going to be someone who takes notice?
FO300001192	And now it's time for you to die.
FO300001193	What? You think you can walk around the Wasteland doing the things that you do and there isn't going to be someone who takes notice?
FO300001194	Such a shame. I hear that you could have been something useful. Ah well. Time to die.
FO300001195	Surprise!
FO300001196	Finally. Got you in my sights.
FO300001197	You won't get away this time.
FO300001198	And now it's time for you to die.
FO300001199	Go away, bleeder!
FO300001200	Nothing to see here, outsider.
FO300001201	We've got this area locked down.
FO300001202	Keep moving, Wastelander.
FO300001203	Move along, outsider.
FO300001204	I thought I told you to get the hell out of here!?! Tenpenny doesn't want your goddamn caps, and I don't want the goddamn headache.
FO300001205	You again? I thought I told you to get lost?
FO300001206	Give me a second. Keep your panties on!
FO300001207	Just a moment!
FO300001208	If you're supposed to be meeting the President, then go do it. Get away from me.
FO300001209	High-level functions offline. Self-destruct sequence initiated. Civilian is advised to secure FEV sample and exit the facility immediately.
FO300001210	High-level functions offline. Self-destruct sequence initiated. Civilian is advised to exit the facility immediately.
FO300001211	So, you're back. We had feared both you and the G.E.C.K. were lost. Were you successful?
FO300001212	Hold it right there!
FO300001213	You're supposed to be in that holding cell. You're not going anywhere!
FO300001214	There's a full complement of guards in the next room. As soon as I get them, you're going back to your cell. In a body bag, if necessary.
FO300001215	I think you'd better leave now.
FO300001216	Ah, face to face at last. It's high time we met.
FO300001217	I am quite pleased you were able to make it. The trip was not what I had intended, but serves as an adequate test of your abilities.
FO300001218	You have the vial, and the task set before you. Shouldn't you be on your way now?
FO300001219	Yes? You still haven't taken the vial yet. As I've said, I'll only allow you to leave once you have it.
FO300001220	Why do you insist on making things difficult?
FO300001221	Maybe I should start shooting. How much blood you think you can afford to lose before you tell me what I want to know?
FO300001222	So, you're awake.
FO300001223	Let's keep this nice and simple. You're going to tell me the code for that Purifier, and you're going to tell me now.
FO300001224	Tenpenny Tower is a wonderful place to live, isn't it?
FO300001225	We are safe from the Wasteland in here.
FO300001226	I would surely have perished if it wasn't for Roy Phillips and his tower.
FO300001227	I would surely have perished if it wasn't for Mister Tenpenny and his tower.
FO300001228	So, Crowley is dead, eh?
FO300001229	Here's your pay. Now, don't spend it all in one place, unless that place is Tenpenny Tower.
FO300001230	Fancy that! A visitor. I seldom get visitors. Which is a tiresome shame because I'm usually relentlessly bored out of my right mind!
FO300001231	All these confounded people fluster about like I'm made of eggshells and about to fall to pieces at any moment. I'm surprised they even let you in.
FO300001232	So what do you think of my fine tower here? It's quite the jewel of the Wasteland isn't it? I daresay I'm quite proud of it myself.
FO300001233	Heigh ho!
FO300001234	This better be important.
FO300001235	What?
FO300001236	You got something to say?
FO300001237	Welcome to New Urban Apparel. I carry the finest in pre-war clothes. Hurry up, lets get you out of those old rags and into something fabulous!
FO300001238	Those clothes are atrocious. You should stop by my shop, New Urban Apparel, and freshen up that look. Upgrade to fabulous!
FO300001239	I'm always glad to see a customer, especially if they are dressed so hideously. Seriously, we have to get you a new wardrobe.
FO300001240	Ah, ready for a fresh look? Good.
FO300001241	How can you be helped today?
FO300001242	You must be here to update that old look of yours. Let me help. I have just the thing!
FO300001243	Hurry up, lets get you out of those old rags and into something fabulous!
FO300001244	I take it this is a social call, and not business?
FO300001245	This is the Tenpenny Wellness Clinic, and I am Doctor Banfield. I keep the residents healthy.
FO300001246	You look hurt. It's a good thing you've come in.
FO300001247	Welcome back to the Wellness Clinic.
FO300001248	I really hope you aren't hurt. The Clinic is closed and I'd really hate to have to open it up at this hour.
FO300001249	I remember you. To what do I owe the pleasure?
FO300001250	Yes? Can I help you?
FO300001251	Get into any adventures recently?
FO300001252	Good to see you again, Comrade.
FO300001253	Welcome to Boutique le Chic. I am Lydia Montenegro, proprietor. Here you'll find only the best, with a price tag you can boast about to your friends!
FO300001254	I am Lydia Montenegro. I'm sure you've heard of me and my shop, Boutique le Chic? No? Obviously you don't travel in the right circles.
FO300001255	I can't talk now, visit me at the Boutique during business hours.
FO300001256	I see my Boutique has proved to be an irresistible lure. Welcome back.
FO300001257	Back for the best?
FO300001258	Shopping at le Chic proves you have great taste!
FO300001259	This better not be a waste of my time.
FO300001260	New here? Pick any table, except that one in the corner. That's Mr. Tenpenny's table. Nobody sits there. Except him, of course.
FO300001261	Welcome to Cafe Beau Monde! Gourmet meals and service with a smile!
FO300001262	Welcome to Cafe Beau Monde! Gourmet meals and service with a smile!
FO300001263	Have a seat. I'll get to you in a minute.
FO300001264	You're new around here. I'm Margaret Primrose. I run the Cafe Beau Monde. Stop by sometime.
FO300001265	Yes?
FO300001266	You may speak to me. And please, don't be tedious.
FO300001267	Yes? You wish to speak to me? Whatever for?
FO300001268	I don't suppose there is someone else for you to talk to?
FO300001269	Are all young people ill-bred these days?
FO300001270	Welcome to the Federalist Lounge. I'm Shakes. Wet your whistle?
FO300001271	Happy Holidays! Care for drink?
FO300001272	A very special welcome to you, sir!
FO300001273	A very special welcome to you, ma'am!
FO300001274	Care to wet your whistle?
FO300001275	Hey there! Is there something I can do for you?
FO300001276	Make it quick, missy.
FO300001277	Keep it short. I'm rather busy avoiding my husband.
FO300001278	What?
FO300001279	Ah yes. Mister Burke is expecting you. He is waiting for you on the balcony.
FO300001280	Mister Tenpenny isn't taking callers.
FO300001281	I'm on duty. Can't talk. Direct your security concerns to Chief Gustavo directly.
FO300001282	I'm not here for your entertainment.
FO300001283	You ever make it to Little Lamplight, you come say hi. Okay mungo?
FO300001284	You should come to Little Lamplight sometime, mungo. You're okay after all.
FO300001285	If you ever go to Little Lamplight, I'll tell Mayor that you're okay, and he'll let you in, okay Mungo?
FO300001286	I'm sorry, voice signature not recognized.
FO300001287	No! I'm not talking to you anymore! You're a jerk and I hate you!
FO300001288	I hope you found me a place to live.
FO300001289	It was so weird! All of a sudden the ants went nuts and started fighting each other.
FO300001290	It was like they were totally crazy! It was really scary, but kinda cool at the same time, ya know what I mean?
FO300001291	It was so weird! All of a sudden the ants went nuts and started fighting each other.
FO300001292	It was like they were totally crazy! It was really scary, but kinda cool at the same time, ya know what I mean?
FO300001293	Wow, you've been gone a while. I was kinda worried.
FO300001294	Come on! Tell me already!
FO300001295	Did you change your mind or something?
FO300001296	What is it, mister?
FO300001297	What is it, lady?
FO300001298	Yes, what did you need?
FO300001299	I've detected some changes within the Queen's Hatchery with my equipment. What's transpired?
FO300001300	We'll speak when we reach the terminal. Nothing must stand in the way of progress!
FO300001301	I trust your task is progressing well.
FO300001302	Well, don't just stand there. You're distracting me. I must calculate the most efficient way to get to my equipment.
FO300001303	I'm finding your interruptions trying. The slightest mistake because of your distractions and my experiments will be ruined!
FO300001304	You startled me!
FO300001305	You really mustn't creep up on people like that.
FO300001306	Yes?
FO300001307	Well, that takes care of that.
FO300001308	By now the Pride should be mopping up whatever opposition is left outside.
FO300001309	Let's get this room secured.
FO300001310	It's time for fighting, not for talking.
FO300001311	If you're going to put the code in, hurry up and do it. Otherwise this place explodes, and everyone in the Wasteland is in danger.
FO300001312	You have to give me that code. If you won't turn this thing on, you have to at least let me do it.
FO300001313	Look, there's nothing more to be said. Cycle the airlock so I can get this over with.
FO300001314	Get out of here as soon as you can. Get back to the Citadel where it's safe.
FO300001315	Well, so much for celebrating.
FO300001316	One of us is going to have to go in there and turn the damned thing on. And whoever does it isn't coming back out.
FO300001317	Not exactly how I imagined going out, you know?
FO300001318	So, what should we do? Draw straws?
FO300001319	You're just going to let him leave like that?
FO300001320	I can't believe you, of all people, would show mercy on him.
FO300001321	The real kicker is that the boys outside will probably cut him down as soon as he opens the door.
FO300001322	Now let's get this place locked down.
FO300001323	I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you'd let him just walk away. It's amazing the world hasn't beaten that out of you.
FO300001324	You'd just better hope it doesn't come back to bite you.
FO300001325	Now let's get this place locked down.
FO300001326	You're just going to let him leave like that?
FO300001327	I'll go along with it, but I don't like it.
FO300001328	Let's get this room secured, and we'll call in the team.
FO300001329	Let's make sure this area is locked down before we do anything else.
FO300001330	You've already won. Allow me to leave with some dignity.
FO300001331	You again.
FO300001332	I can't say I'm surprised. You and your ilk seem hell-bent on destroying everything our government has worked to achieve.
FO300001333	There's nothing to stop me from killing you this time. Let's end this.
FO300001334	Stay sharp, and stick close to me until we're in the Control Room.
FO300001335	Head for the control room, and keep your head down.
FO300001336	Look, if we make it to the purifier we can chat then. Now's not exactly a good time.
FO300001337	Are you ready now? We can't afford to keep standing around like this.
FO300001338	Before we get started, I wanted to let you know that my father and I have been talking.
FO300001339	The Pride and I have decided that after all you've survived, you've done enough to be an honorary member of Lyon's Pride.
FO300001340	So congratulations. Membership comes with some privileges, including our Power Armor. You want the full suit, or the Recon armor?
FO300001341	Please, I have much work to do. Talk to Sarah about your role in the assault.
FO300001342	You're reporting to Sarah from here on out. Don't let her down.
FO300001343	I'm sure you'll understand that there's far too much to be done right now. I've no time for chatting.
FO300001344	This is surprising. Another of my kind, who does not follow the mindless killing way.
FO300001345	You haven't shot at me yet. That's different.
FO300001346	Are you afraid of me? I understand. All of my brothers you've met have been savage killers.
FO300001347	I try to think I am different from them, but maybe I'm only fooling myself. Maybe there is no escaping my inborn nature.
FO300001348	You are friends with another of my brothers? I am astounded! I thought I was the only one who wanted more from life.
FO300001349	Ah, my little friend. Our paths cross once again. I have wandered far since we last spoke.
FO300001350	I am glad to see you, little one. I hope your life has been happy since we last spoke.
FO300001351	Hello, little brother. Good to see you again.
FO300001352	Hello, little sister. Good to see you again.
FO300001353	I'm so glad you came back to see me.
FO300001354	I always enjoy our little chats. How can I help you?
FO300001355	Have you heard? A man named Hannibal Hamlin is gathering all the escaped slaves at a safe place called the Temple of the Union!
FO300001356	Finally, people are standing up against the Slavers! We're on our way to join Hannibal's cause!
FO300001357	Thanks again for your help. For Freedom!
FO300001358	We have a dangerous journey ahead of us. What did you need?
FO300001359	Thanks, friend. That was a narrow shave and no mistake. Probably would have eaten us or whatever those damned things do to people.
FO300001360	Listen, we got some water we can spare. Go ahead, you earned it.
FO300001361	Whew. Thanks for the help. I thought I was a goner.
FO300001362	You probably saved my life. Here, take this. You look like you may need it more than I will.
FO300001363	Where'd he come from? If you hadn't come along, that ugly brute probably would've eaten me, or dragged me off to wherever.
FO300001364	Here, take this. It's the least I can do.
FO300001365	Thanks, stranger. That thing would probably have killed me if it wasn't for you.
FO300001366	I wish I had more, but I want you to have this. And I won't take no for an answer.
FO300001367	You don't usually see those damned Super Mutants out so far from D.C. Good thing there was only one of them.
FO300001368	What's up, tourist?
FO300001369	We need to have us a little talk. You keep your gun in your holster when you're in my town.
FO300001370	Otherwise, we're going to have a problem. And Charon solves my problems for me. Understand?
FO300001371	Back for more, eh? What can I get for you?
FO300001372	It's not much, I know, but it's mine! So, if you need anything, just let me know. Greta will get you any food you want, and I handle the rooms.
FO300001373	It's so good to have someone new here, even if it is an ugly ol' smoothskin! I'm kidding! I'm just kiddin! Don't make that face! You'll love it here.
FO300001374	It's not much, I know, but it's mine! So, if you need anything, just let me know. Greta will get you any food you want, and I handle the rooms.
FO300001375	It's so good to have someone new here, especially a pretty young smoothskin like yourself! I hope you like it here!
FO300001376	Oh, I just love to see your pretty face smiling at me. What do you need, honey?
FO300001377	Oh, I was just telling Greta "that pretty young smoothskin hasn't been around in a while", and here you are!
FO300001378	Oh, hello again! Do you need anything, darling?
FO300001379	Well, hello. It's always good to see a customer. What do you need?
FO300001380	See, I knew you'd be back.
FO300001381	Oh, hello again! Do you need anything?
FO300001382	Unit running Patrol Scheme Delta-Seven.
FO300001383	Unit running Patrol Scheme Alpha-Four.
FO300001384	Talk to Ahzrukhal.
FO300001385	No. Go talk to Ahzurkhal.
FO300001386	Goddammit! Why did you tell Carol that Gob was dead? You couldn't have kept that to yourself?
FO300001387	You know, not everyone needs to hear the truth about everything. She was perfectly fine thinking that he'd found happiness out there.
FO300001388	Sorry. I'm on a break. I'll be back in a bit if you need some food.
FO300001389	Oh look. It's everyone's favorite bearer of bad news.
FO300001390	Oh, hey. It's you. Did you bring some good news for us?
FO300001391	Hey. I say you over there talking to Carol. She's friendly, isn't she? But don't you get any ideas about her. Got it? Good.
FO300001392	Now, do you want something to eat?
FO300001393	Mornin', hon. What'll it be?
FO300001394	If you want something to eat, you should order it quick, hon. The stew just stopped moving.
FO300001395	You need somethin', hon?
FO300001396	Why the hell did you wake me up?
FO300001397	Oh, you again.
FO300001398	Oh, why hello there. Pleasure to meet you! I'm Quinn.
FO300001399	Sorry sorry! So busy!
FO300001400	Just couldn't stay away from us, could you?
FO300001401	Oh, hello, my boy! You've come back for more stories from ol' Quinn, have you?
FO300001402	Oh, hello, my girl! You've come back for more stories from ol' Quinn, have you?
FO300001403	I just sharpened the knives! Have a seat and we'll give you a new look!
FO300001404	Good to see you again! You ready for some more of the ol' snip-snip?
FO300001405	Hey! You here for a cut? Maybe a buzz? Mohawk? C'mon! Something!
FO300001406	You came back! Do you need something?
FO300001407	Oh, well would you look at that? We got us a smoothskin visitor! Hoooeeee, we ain't seen one of your type in a long time.
FO300001408	What? You come to try to steal from me again? Just get out of my face.
FO300001409	Didn't you hear me? Leave us alone.
FO300001410	Well, hello again. You need something, smoothskin?
FO300001411	How's Underworld been treatin' you so far, smoothskin?
FO300001412	Well look who's back. What can I do you for, smoothskin?
FO300001413	Well look who's back. What can I do you for, smoothskin?
FO300001414	Holy shit! What happened?
FO300001415	What the fuck happened?
FO300001416	It's so weird here without Azhrukhal.
FO300001417	I still can't believe that Charon shot Ahzrukhal. I never saw that one coming.
FO300001418	Did you see that? Charon just shot Ahzrukhal!
FO300001419	There are a lot more of us down here than there are of you, smoothskin. You just behave yourself.
FO300001420	I hope you don't mind the smell, I know how sensitive you humans can be.
FO300001421	That's humans for you, always so goddamn friendly.
FO300001422	We don't get a lot of your kind down here.
FO300001423	What makes you think that we've got something to say to one another?
FO300001424	So, Mechanist! You've come to throw yourself on the mercy of the Ant Queen?
FO300001425	Very well! We shall grant you the kindest of our gifts for any human. A swift death!
FO300001426	At last, I've come to destroy the Mechanist's precious Forge. And no minion of his will stop me!
FO300001427	Now, face death from the AntAgonizer!
FO300001428	Please, just leave me alone. I want to leave all of this behind me.
FO300001429	Who dares interrupt the AntAgonizer? Begone!
FO300001430	I have no time to waste with you. Far more important matters await the attention of the AntAgonizer!
FO300001431	At last, you've pried the shell off of that meaty little Mechanist. Give it to me!
FO300001432	My spies tell me that meddling Mechanist has been removed from the picture. I only wish I had that tin-man's shell to gloat over!
FO300001433	Bring me the suit of the Mechanist, and then we can talk.
FO300001434	Excellent. Now, peel that tin-man's suit from his corpse and bring it to me. I wish to examine it more closely.
FO300001435	Bring me the suit of the Mechanist, and then we can talk.
FO300001436	You don't have the Mechanist's suit. Don't waste my time until you've brought me that prize!
FO300001437	So, at last you've penetrated the court of the AntAgonizer, Queen of All Ants!
FO300001438	Were you sent by that meddling Mechanist? He'll learn that no one can stand before my royal regiment of fighting ants!
FO300001439	Explain yourself! Why shouldn't I have my pretties kill you where you stand?
FO300001440	You again! What is it, now?
FO300001441	Make this fast. I have royal matters to ponder.
FO300001442	Hahaha! Bow, peasant! Bow before the Ant Queen!
FO300001443	Aha! Vile AntAgonizer! You've got a lot of moxie, invading my private sanctum! Pretty courageous, for a spineless insect!
FO300001444	But this is as far as you go. Now it's time to put down the foot of justice and crush your nefarious plans once and for all!
FO300001445	Vile minion of the AntAgonizer, you and your creepy mistress will face the unbending wrath of the Mechanist!
FO300001446	Now, face death from the Mechanist!
FO300001447	Really. Thanks for all your help, but I've got things I have to attend to.
FO300001448	I'm sorry. Just leave me alone. I've got a lot to think about.
FO300001449	Can't talk now, citizen! I must be leaving. Be safe!
FO300001450	Well done! You have defeated the vile AntAgonizer, and you've brought back her suit so that we may destroy the last taint of her villainy!
FO300001451	Hand it to me, and I'll make sure that no one else can ever bear the mantle of the foul AntAgonizer!
FO300001452	You had best hand over the AntAgonizer suit. It's too dangerous to let it fall into the wrong hands.
FO300001453	Excellent work, Mechano-Lad! Now that the vile AntAgonizer is defeated, all that remains is to destroy the shell of her evil.
FO300001454	Bring me the foul AntAgonizer's armor, and we can do what must be done.
FO300001455	Excellent work, Mechano-Lass! Now that the vile AntAgonizer is defeated, all that remains is to destroy the shell of her evil.
FO300001456	Bring me the foul AntAgonizer's armor, and we can do what must be done.
FO300001457	My super-spybots tell me that the AntAgonizer has been defeated. I trust I have you to thank for this?
FO300001458	Congratulations, but I really must make sure her suit is destroyed, lest it fall into even more evil hands.
FO300001459	Bring me the foul AntAgonizer's armor, and we can talk further. Until then, leave me be.
FO300001460	I must neutralize the AntAgonizer's suit. When you've removed it from her vile corpse, bring it to me.
FO300001461	What are you doing in here? How did you get past my defenses? Did the AntAgonizer send you?
FO300001462	Speak now citizen or I'll be forced to detain you until I can ascertain your true motives!
FO300001463	I trust everything is acceptable, citizen?
FO300001464	Can't talk now. They're fighting! This is awesome!
FO300001465	I don't wanna talk to you. You killed my Uncle Roe.
FO300001466	Go away! I hate you!
FO300001467	Oh man! Did you see it! Did you see it? The AntAgonizer was all like, "Fear me!" But the Mechanist was all, "Stop, evil-doer!"
FO300001468	Whew! You wouldn't believe how much trouble those two have caused in this town. We've been looking for someone to get rid of them for a long time.
FO300001469	But you just walked in and cleaned up the town, easy as you please! We're in your debt, that's for sure.
FO300001470	I'm mayor of Canterbury Commons, think of me as your own Uncle Roe. And take this, as our thanks for cleaning up the town.
FO300001471	Whew! You wouldn't believe how much trouble those two have caused in this town. We've been looking for someone to get rid of them for a long time.
FO300001472	But you just walked in, downed one, and drove off the other, easy as you please! That'll be the last we see of them, you can be sure of that!
FO300001473	I'm mayor of Canterbury Commons, think of me as your own Uncle Roe. And take this, as our thanks for cleaning up the town.
FO300001474	Change your mind yet? You willing to help us deal with the AntAgonizer and Mechanist?
FO300001475	So, it looks like you decided to do things their way. How come?
FO300001476	Well, well, well! Look who it is Bob! It's our new friend!
FO300001477	Hey! My second best friend in the whole wide world!
FO300001478	Hiya.
FO300001479	I'm very happy to see you again, savior of Oasis.
FO300001480	What is it, Outsider?
FO300001481	Ah, it's nice to have the pleasure of your company again.
FO300001482	What is it you need, Outsider?
FO300001483	What do you want?
FO300001484	Welcome back, my good friend!
FO300001485	Yes, Outsider?
FO300001486	Goodness, it's wonderful to speak to you again!
FO300001487	What is it now, Outsider?
FO300001488	Yes, my friend? What can I do for you now?
FO300001489	What is it, Outsider?
FO300001490	So, it looks like you decided to do things their way. How come?
FO300001491	See Herbert? Now that's a nice person for you. Why can't you be more like that!
FO300001492	Look, Herbert, he's back. I told you!
FO300001493	Look, Herbert, she's back. I told you!
FO300001494	Glad to see you're finally awake. I can't believe they made you do that stupid ceremony.
FO300001495	Birch's word is the law. You must leave Oasis at once.
FO300001496	You big dummy! Now we gotta wait for another Outsider!
FO300001497	I'm afraid you're no longer welcome in His home. Please begone.
FO300001498	Was it too much to ask to expect some civility from you? Bah. Get out of my sight.
FO300001499	I'm afraid you're no longer welcome here. If you come back, we have orders to shoot.
FO300001500	By insulting the Tree Father, you've insulted us all. You are no longer a guest here. I'd advise you to leave immediately.
FO300001501	I thought I was quite clear. Leave or we will be forced to take action!
FO300001502	How could this happen to us? Where did we go wrong?
FO300001503	This can't be! It just can't! How could He leave us?
FO300001504	Our god lives no more.
FO300001505	I can't believe He's gone. He meant everything to me.
FO300001506	I've just seen Tree Father and Leaf Mother Laurel enter the Grove. This worries me.
FO300001507	Our leaders speak with the Great One. I hope nothing's wrong.
FO300001508	Tree Father and Leaf Mother are conferring with the Great One. Something important must be happening.
FO300001509	Something here is different. I can feel it.
FO300001510	I feel a change in the air, I wonder what it could be?
FO300001511	Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bloomseer Poplar, soothsayer and healer of Oasis.
FO300001512	It brings me great honor to welcome you.
FO300001513	You have more questions for me perhaps?
FO300001514	Go away, you big meanie!
FO300001515	So you're the Outsider huh? You seem nice to me!
FO300001516	Hiya!
FO300001517	Branchtender Cypress at your service. Welcome to our little home.
FO300001518	Ah, Outsider. So nice to see you again.
FO300001519	It's very nice to meet you, Outsider. I'm Branchtender Linden.
FO300001520	Good to speak to you again.
FO300001521	Yes, what can I do for you on this beautiful day?
FO300001522	Have you changed your mind, Outsider? Do you want to speak with Tree Father Birch?
FO300001523	How could you do this to us? How could you take him away from us?
FO300001524	Any chance the Wasteland had for recovery someday is now gone.
FO300001525	Please, I wish to be alone right now.
FO300001526	You've done a great deed this day, my friend.
FO300001527	The gifts the Great One has bestowed upon us will now take mere decades to breach the confines of Oasis instead of centuries.
FO300001528	The choice you made disturbs me, Outsider. Why you chose to side with my husband when it's quite clear Oasis could have benefited all eludes me.
FO300001529	No matter. What's done is done, and I'll still do the best that I can to find a way to spread his influence throughout the Wasteland.
FO300001530	You have questions for me, Outsider?
FO300001531	I love Birch, but sometimes I think he doesn't see the big picture.
FO300001532	The Great One is dead. Slain by your hand. Don't worry, I hold no grudge towards you.
FO300001533	You'll have to forgive my people at a time like this, Outsider. They aren't used to being so lost.
FO300001534	And for once, I don't have the words to help them.
FO300001535	The choice you made disturbs me, Outsider. Why you chose to side with my wife when it's quite clear Oasis would be in peril eludes me.
FO300001536	No matter. What's done is done, and I'll still do the best that I can keeping Him safe from those that seek to harm Him.
FO300001537	You've done a great deed this day, my friend. You've ensured the safety of the Great One and the inhabitants of Oasis.
FO300001538	Yes, Outsider? What is it?
FO300001539	I know why you're here and despite what my wife thinks, I know you'll do what's best for Oasis.
FO300001540	After all, He chose you and He would never want to put us in harm's way.
FO300001541	What's wrong? Why are you leaving?
FO300001542	As soon as the rest of the Treeminders are in place, we'll begin.
FO300001543	What is it you wish to talk about, my friend?
FO300001544	You have no idea how overjoyed I am to see you! Normally Outsiders are forbidden inside Oasis, but He has made an exception.
FO300001545	We will speak once we've arrived in the Pavilion. Not to worry, all will be explained.
FO300001546	I'm so glad you're here. It's been a while since anyone's visited us, and He's been waiting for someone like yourself to arrive.
FO300001547	If you wouldn't mind following me, I'll bring you right to Him.
FO300001548	Do hurry, He doesn't like to be kept waiting!
FO300001549	It's not wise to keep the Great One waiting.
FO300001550	Now is the time for an audience with Him. We can talk later.
FO300001551	We aren't permitted to speak until the Ceremony has completed.
FO300001552	We'll speak after you meet the Great One.
FO300001553	Prepare yourself to meet Him, Outsider. It will change your life.
FO300001554	The Ceremony of Purification has begun. Rejoice!
FO300001555	No more words. The Ceremony begins.
FO300001556	Take your place, Outsider. The Ceremony is about to begin.
FO300001557	Rejoice, the Great One wishes to see you!
FO300001558	You are welcome amongst us, Outsider.
FO300001559	Revel, Outsider, for he has chosen you!
FO300001560	Like the Great One Himself, we welcome you with outstretched arms.
FO300001561	Welcome to Oasis, Outsider. We hope you'll find peace among us.
FO300001562	We're very pleased to see you, Outsider. Welcome!
FO300001563	Welcome, Outsider!
FO300001564	Stand aside, comrade, while we deal with these Imperialist dogs.
FO300001565	The Henderson estate is in tip-top shape, young master. Have a wonderful day!
FO300001566	The Henderson estate is in tip-top shape, young miss. Have a wonderful day!
FO300001567	<bark!>
FO300001568	How could Roger accuse me of something like that? What is wrong with him?
FO300001569	[crying]
FO300001570	Do you realize what you’ve done? You’ve triggered the Failsafe! Ruined everything! The subjects will die, and I’ll be stuck here in this hell! Alone!
FO300001571	You've ruined everything! EVERYTHING!
FO300001572	I exist to serve.
FO300001573	I've given you permission to leave. I suggest you take the opportunity before I change my mind.
FO300001574	I'm even being so gracious as to allow your father to exit as well. His presence here failed to amuse me some time ago.
FO300001575	Most enjoyable. Most enjoyable indeed. I haven't felt this exhilarated in years.
FO300001576	A commendable start, but you still have work to do.
FO300001577	Quite a clever interpretation of the rules. I'll have to reset the system to restore Martha, but it's well worth the effort.
FO300001578	You have taken a far greater interest in these little games than your father did. He found the whole thing beneath him.
FO300001579	Listen, you can't hurt people here, okay?
FO300001580	At least, not unless I say it's okay. It's against the rules! I can fix it, but you better not do it again.
FO300001581	Stop hurting people without me telling you to. You're ruining all the fun!
FO300001582	I'll fix it again, but you're making me sad.
FO300001583	As amusing as it may be, you cannot simply wander around killing the residents of Tranquility Lane.
FO300001584	I shall have to reset portions of the system to correct this.
FO300001585	I can return the people of Tranquility Lane to life, but anything else you have meddled with will stay as it was. Do keep that in mind.
FO300001586	I believe we've discussed this already. I appreciate the fervor with which you approach things, but indiscriminate killing impedes our fun.
FO300001587	I shall again reset portions of the system to undo your mistakes.
FO300001588	What are you doing? I didn't tell you to kill him!
FO300001589	If I wanted you to kill him, I'd have told you to do that. Gosh, you're slow.
FO300001590	Lucky for you, you get another chance.
FO300001591	You shouldn't be here, little one.
FO300001592	Remember what I told you. The Failsafe. You've got to find it!
FO300001593	This has to end.
FO300001594	Don't you have a few things you should be collecting? Get the knife and the mask from the dog house.
FO300001595	Appliances certainly can be dangerous, can't they?
FO300001596	You are most resourceful, and you certainly do get results. You have exceeded my expectations.
FO300001597	And now, we come to the last task that I have for you. Succeed, and you shall be granted whatever you wish.
FO300001598	A roller skate, on the stairs? Oh my, that is simply inspired.
FO300001599	You are most resourceful, and you certainly do get results. You have exceeded my expectations.
FO300001600	And now, we come to the last task that I have for you. Succeed, and you shall be granted whatever you wish.
FO300001601	Poor Mabel, killed by her own robot. I suspect she never saw that coming.
FO300001602	You are most resourceful, and you certainly do get results. You have exceeded my expectations.
FO300001603	And now, we come to the last task that I have for you. Succeed, and you shall be granted whatever you wish.
FO300001604	Well done, well done!
FO300001605	You certainly do get results. You have exceeded my expectations.
FO300001606	And now, we come to the last task that I have for you. Succeed, and you shall be granted whatever you wish.
FO300001607	I expected more creative results from you. Mabel awaits you for another try.
FO300001608	I appreciate that you're trying, but so far I am unimpressed with the results. Give it another go.
FO300001609	Not quite what I had in mind. But you get a chance to try again. Go to it!
FO300001610	See to it that Mabel meets an untimely, and hopefully gruesome, demise.
FO300001611	I've told you what I want from you. I want to see some creativity. And I want to see Mabel dead.
FO300001612	Are you through pouting?
FO300001613	You have turned out to be quite resourceful, it seems. I am slightly impressed.
FO300001614	I enjoy your company far more than your father's. He responded quite negatively to my requests.
FO300001615	So you have achieved your goal. I was hoping for something a bit more dramatic, but persuasion appears to be your strong suit.
FO300001616	And at least you are cooperative, unlike your father. I was most disappointed when he refused to participate, yet still expected something from me.
FO300001617	I'm curious to see how you deal with the Rockwells.
FO300001618	Don't you have something you should be doing now?
FO300001619	Are we willing to be reasonable now? I ask so very little of you.
FO300001620	Ha ha! Did you see him crying! What a big baby!
FO300001621	You have won the game, and so you get a prize. You may ask of me a single question, and I shall answer you.
FO300001622	You did it, even though you said you wouldn't. You're tricky!
FO300001623	Murdering Timmy's parent? Very inventive. I approve.
FO300001624	And with that, you win a prize. You may ask a single question of me, and receive an honest answer.
FO300001625	You did it! I knew you could!
FO300001626	And a particularly brutal way to deal with it, at that. Very effective.
FO300001627	And with that, you win a prize. You may ask a single question of me, and receive an honest answer.
FO300001628	You sure showed him, didn't you?
FO300001629	I suppose it wasn't the most cerebral way to deal with the situation, but it was definitely effective. Consider the game won.
FO300001630	And with that, you win a prize. Your prize is one question, which I will answer to the best of my ability.
FO300001631	I was hoping for more than fisticuffs, but entertainment has been difficult to come by lately. Consider the game won.
FO300001632	And with that, you win a prize. Your prize is one question, which I will answer to the best of my ability.
FO300001633	Decided you want to play after all, huh?
FO300001634	I had a feeling you'd come around. Your approach was somewhat uninspired, but it'll do.
FO300001635	Since you won the game, you get a prize. You may ask one question, which I will answer as honestly as possible.
FO300001636	I thought you didn't want to play. But you went and did it anyway. Good for you! Wasn't it fun?
FO300001637	A clever approach. I'm not sure I would have considered it. Very encouraging.
FO300001638	Your reward for winning the game is to ask a single question. I will answer honestly and frankly.
FO300001639	Yay, you did it! Good job!
FO300001640	A clever approach. I'm not sure I would have considered it. Very encouraging.
FO300001641	Your reward for winning the game is to ask a single question. I will answer honestly and frankly.
FO300001642	Yay! I knew you could do it!
FO300001643	Perhaps not the most inventive approach, but persuasion can be quite powerful. Well done.
FO300001644	And for winning the game, you get a prize. You get to ask one question, and receive an honest answer.
FO300001645	Timmy's back, so you can try again. Don't take too long, or the game won't be fun anymore.
FO300001646	You're mean! I hate you!
FO300001647	Hi there. I'm Timmy. Want to play?
FO300001648	Hi. Want to play?
FO300001649	You're supposed to be making Timmy cry. You can do it, I know you can!
FO300001650	When you win the game, maybe we can talk some more.
FO300001651	You don't want to play my game, so I don't want to talk to you.
FO300001652	You don't want to play with me. So I don't want to talk to you, and you're never going to find your daddy. Boo hoo hoo.
FO300001653	Oh, someone new to play with! What good luck I have lately!
FO300001654	I was just starting to get bored. Oh, we're going to have so much fun!
FO300001655	Can we play now? I've been waiting. I've been ever so patient.
FO300001656	You probably oughta go talk to Betty, kiddo. Don't want to keep her waiting!
FO300001657	She's out there on the playground, probably looking for you. Run along now.
FO300001658	Have you talked to Betty? I think she's waiting for you.
FO300001659	You really shouldn't keep her waiting. She'll probably be on the playground. Run along now.
FO300001660	Oh, hello there.
FO300001661	Hiya, kid.
FO300001662	You might want to go talk to Betty before you wander around too much. She's waiting for you.
FO300001663	Hello there. Good to see you.
FO300001664	I think Betty is waiting for you on the playground. You'll want to go talk to her.
FO300001665	Hello there, dear. Beautiful weather we're having, wouldn't you say?
FO300001666	I think Betty is waiting for you at the playground. You really should go pay her a visit.
FO300001667	Hey there, sport! Beautiful day, isn't it?
FO300001668	Say, you should go talk to Betty. She's waiting for you over on the playground. Have fun, sport!
FO300001669	What can I do for you, sport?
FO300001670	Hiya, kiddo! What's the good word?
FO300001671	Hey there, sport. How's it going?
FO300001672	Hey there, little lady. How's it going?
FO300001673	Hello, sweetie. How are you?
FO300001674	Well hi there!
FO300001675	Good day to you!
FO300001676	You've saved me. I was afraid I'd be trapped in there forever.
FO300001677	Who is this? You're not authorized to use this intercom!
FO300001678	The time for talk is over. Now, you must act. Go to the purifier. Make your father proud!
FO300001679	It's time to show the Enclave who they're dealing with. Now let's move out!
FO300001680	For Elder Lyons!
FO300001681	Good luck!
FO300001682	Project Purity is as good as ours!
FO300001683	Look, Elder Lyons and the others are assembled in the lab. There's talk of assaulting the purifier. You'd better get down there right away.
FO300001684	Glad to see you're still in one piece. You're just in time for the action. Best get to the lab and talk with Elder Lyons.
FO300001685	You're back! Listen, something's happening. You need to get to the lab and talk to Elder Lyons right away!
FO300001686	It's good to see you back. But you'd better get to the lab right away, and report to Elder Lyons.
FO300001687	Great to see you, but have you spoken to Elder Lyons? He's here in the lab level, near the robot.
FO300001688	You need to report to Elder Lyons A.S.A.P. He's over by the robot.
FO300001689	I'm sorry, but I really don't have time to talk right now. Perhaps Scribe Jameson could help you?
FO300001690	All this time spent acquiring technology, and we look like cavemen next to the Enclave. That is not acceptable.
FO300001691	Welcome to the Citadel, friend of Steel.
FO300001692	You ever seen a Super Mutant's head explode? Hell of a mess.
FO300001693	I hear those Enclave soldiers are equipped with Plasma weapons. Lucky bastards.
FO300001694	I will serve the Citadel and Elder Lyons until my dying breath. Is there any better life?
FO300001695	Long live Elder Lyons!
FO300001696	Yes?
FO300001697	Hail to you, son of James.
FO300001698	Hail to you, daughter of James.
FO300001699	Ah, it's good to see you again.
FO300001700	What are you thinking? [Sighs] Anyway, I am Knight Captain Dusk, in service of Steel. If you require anything, simply ask.
FO300001701	Hail to you, stranger. I am Knight Captain Dusk, in service of Steel. If you require anything, simply ask.
FO300001702	I'm sorry, what part of "I'm done with you" didn't you understand? Leave me alone, Waster.
FO300001703	Did I stutter? Get out of my face.
FO300001704	What? Can you not see that I'm concentrating here? You're gonna get your head blown off if you aren't careful. What do you want anyway?
FO300001705	Do you really think it's wise to interrupt a sniper with a loaded rifle in her hand in the middle of a live fire drill?
FO300001706	What's so important anyway?
FO300001707	You holdin' it together, stranger? I see you're still in one piece. That's a good start, eh?
FO300001708	Still alive, I see. You're doing better than most Wasters that end up in the city.
FO300001709	Each day we make it to the end's a good one, eh? What do you need?
FO300001710	...
FO300001711	Yes?
FO300001712	What?
FO300001713	Speak.
FO300001714	Quartermaster Durga here, stranger. I have to say, I'm not sure what you're doing in my armory.
FO300001715	We run a tight ship and unless Elder Lyons says so, we don't trade with outsiders.
FO300001716	Quartermaster out.
FO300001717	Look, I told you. The Brotherhood doesn't trade with outsiders. If you want permission, you'll need to speak with Elder Lyons.
FO300001718	You again? Was I not clear the first time? I'm under order not to trade with outsiders for supplies. These orders come directly from Elder Lyons.
FO300001719	If you've got a problem with that, talk to him. Quartermaster out.
FO300001720	I received word from Elder Lyons. He says that you have permission to trade with us. Good for you.
FO300001721	Yeah? What do you need?
FO300001722	Quartermaster here. What do you need?
FO300001723	Glad to see you and that egghead Li made it here in one piece. I heard what happened at that purifier. Hell of thing.
FO300001724	'can I do for you, kid?
FO300001725	Good to see you in one piece, partner. What can I do for you?
FO300001726	What do you need?
FO300001727	I swear, these kids'd be lost without me here to powder their asses.
FO300001728	I swear, these kids couldn't hit a barn door. Talk to me, say something to get my mind of these sorry ass recruits.
FO300001729	These kids couldn't hit the ass end of a Behemoth at five paces. You should get in there and show 'em a thing or two, eh? That'd be a laugh.
FO300001730	Hail, friend.
FO300001731	I bend my knee to the might of Steel.
FO300001732	How can I help, friend?
FO300001733	Hrm? Yes, hello. I've heard about you. We don't get many strangers here in the Citadel, especially those who walk about unescorted.
FO300001734	I am Scribe Bowditch. If you require something, simply ask.
FO300001735	How may a serve you, friend of Steel?
FO300001736	Hail, outsider. I am Scribe Jameson.
FO300001737	Word of your ordeal has spread. I am truly sorry for the loss of your father. But if I can help you in any way, please let me know.
FO300001738	"Knowledge is the beginning of wisdom, not the end of it." One of my favorite quotes. Its author has been lost to us.
FO300001739	How can I help you, outsider?
FO300001740	I came across something interesting: "The possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery. There is always more mystery."
FO300001741	Quite true, don't you think?
FO300001742	"If we value the pursuit of knowledge, we must be free to follow wherever that search may lead us."
FO300001743	I found that in an ancient book. The words of wisdom of one of the greatest men of the former civilzation.
FO300001744	Now, I'm really very busy. Is there something you needed?
FO300001745	What do you want, outsider?
FO300001746	Yes? Can I help you? I'm very busy.
FO300001747	Yes, what is it?
FO300001748	How can I help you? Be quick about it.
FO300001749	We've said all that we have to say to one another.
FO300001750	I will not have James disgraced by anyone, including his ungrateful child.
FO300001751	Now get out of my sight.
FO300001752	Hail to you. By the traction of hospitality and on the word of Elder Lyons, I welcome you to the Citadel.
FO300001753	I am Star Paladin Cross, Keeper of the ARM, and Seneschal to Elder Lyons.
FO300001754	And, I am honored to say, I was acquainted with your father. Now, what may I do to help you?
FO300001755	Good evening. What do you require of me?
FO300001756	I salute you, warrior. You walk among us, but apart from us. How may I aid you?
FO300001757	Go away! You're going to get me chewed out!
FO300001758	Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
FO300001759	Stand down, civilian.
FO300001760	Please address any questions to Paladin Bael.
FO300001761	You're making me edgy. Back off.
FO300001762	If there's an issue, you should speak to my superior, Paladin Bael.
FO300001763	Name's Paladin Bael. What do you need, civilian?
FO300001764	You again.
FO300001765	State your business, and be quick about it.
FO300001766	What do you need, civilian?
FO300001767	What aid can I offer you, outsider?
FO300001768	Great job kid! Meet me around front.
FO300001769	Herbert Dashwood. Damn glad to meet you! Call me Daring. Everyone else does.
FO300001770	Don't suppose you'll let me finish this drink before killing me? Hmm?
FO300001771	It's hard to drink with all that screaming.
FO300001772	Okay fine! Quit pestering me. I know I'm going to bloody die, and I want to do it with a bloody, Bloody Mary in my hand. Is that alright with you?
FO300001773	I'm busy drinking.
FO300001774	Die zombie!
FO300001775	Goddamn it! This is no time to talk!
FO300001776	Great job kid!
FO300001777	Here, take this mask. It'll keep you safe from the Ferals. Just don't get too close to them, or they'll sniff you out. Don't forget to PUT IT ON!
FO300001778	Come on kid. There's killing and maiming going on. We can talk later.
FO300001779	Help!
FO300001780	Are you daft?! Don't stand there. Do something!
FO300001781	Please! Don't hurt me!
FO300001782	Oh my God! They're killing everyone!
FO300001783	Help! Don't kill me!
FO300001784	Help!
FO300001785	Why are you doing this?
FO300001786	Don't just stand their child! Take up the fight!
FO300001787	Aiiiyeeeeah! Get away from me!
FO300001788	Find a place to hide, comrade!
FO300001789	Don't hurt me! Please!
FO300001790	We're all going to die!
FO300001791	No!!! Don't!
FO300001792	Help us! Please!
FO300001793	Don't hurt me!
FO300001794	Help us!
FO300001795	What's the status on those Tenpenny bigots?
FO300001796	Well kid, what've you accomplished?
FO300001797	What's the word at Tenpenny, kid?
FO300001798	What do you want?
FO300001799	What are you looking at?
FO300001800	I'm really not in the mood, so leave me alone.
FO300001801	You take care of those Ghouls yet?
FO300001802	The Ghouls trying to get in are all dead.
FO300001803	You having trouble with those Ghouls?
FO300001804	The Ghouls trying to get in are all dead.
FO300001805	Hmph. Didn't think you had it in you. Guess you proved me wrong. Good job. Knowing those Ghouls are gone takes a load off my mind. Thanks.
FO300001806	You'll be wanting the reward now, won't you. I suppose you've earned it.
FO300001807	There's your caps. Contract fulfilled, debt paid. This don't mean we're buddies, alright? Now get going.
FO300001808	The Ghouls trying to get in are all dead.
FO300001809	Your constant need to chatter is pressing on my optic nerve.
FO300001810	Yes?
FO300001811	You have a curious look about you. I presume you have something interesting to tell me?
FO300001812	Well, well. What have we here? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Susan Lancaster. Perhaps we can become better acquainted, in the near future?
FO300001813	Hmm. What have we here? A lost little girl? Do you have permission to be in here? If not, you should leave before it gets ugly.
FO300001814	Edgar Wellington the second, at your service. Please excuse my demeanor. My wife recently passed away.
FO300001815	Edgar Wellington the second. Have you met my wife Millicent?
FO300001816	Edgar Wellington the second, at your service.
FO300001817	I am Comrade Cheng, beloved leader of the people, shining servant of the community! How can I help you?
FO300001818	I'm Michael Hawthorne. Who are you? And more importantly, should I care?
FO300001819	I can't talk now.
FO300001820	Introductions are in order. I am Mrs. Edgar Wellington. You may refer to me as Madam or My Lady Wellington.
FO300001821	My name is Tiffany Cheng. My miserable excuse for a husband, is "comrade" Irving Cheng, and you can tell him I said so.
FO300001822	You better get a move on before they really get mad and hunt you down.
FO300001823	Oh great. Now you got yourself kicked out of here.
FO300001824	I can't believe you'd kill those innocent people like that. And I thought I was a monster!
FO300001825	If I could move, I would show you a thing or two, but Bob has me stuck here.
FO300001826	Those people you killed were some of the most peaceful people in the Wasteland!
FO300001827	How could you do that to them?
FO300001828	Leave me alone! Me and Bob have better things to do than speak to a murderer!
FO300001829	Now go away and never come back!
FO300001830	How dare you come into Oasis and shoot up the place!
FO300001831	Even Bob is mad at you, and he never gets mad except when I don't stop calling him Herbert!
FO300001832	I'm only gonna ask you this one time. Give me the Naughty Nightwear!
FO300001833	Yeah, yeah. Just keep on walkin'.
FO300001834	So, what did ya bring me?
FO300001835	So what's the deal. You gonna get me some Sugar Bombs or what?
FO300001836	Get away from me, smoothskin.
FO300001837	You lookin' for a problem?
FO300001838	The hell you looking at, smoothskin?
FO300001839	I like these guys, they let me play with their pucks.
FO300001840	Hey, I may be just a Winger now, but I'll make Centre soon.
FO300001841	Sorry, we've got practice. Maybe we'll cross sticks again one day.
FO300001842	Hold it right there! What are you doing here?
FO300001843	What the hell do you want? I hope you've decided to be more civil.
FO300001844	No, I'm sorry. I tried to be nice to you and you decided to make fun of me. Well, this old lady doesn't put up with those shenanigans.
FO300001845	Oh my goodness gracious! Seems like you've been gone forever. Please tell me you have good news.
FO300001846	No luck yet finding the Soil Stradivarius, eh?
FO300001847	Let me know if there's anything I can do to help!
FO300001848	My name's Agatha. What brings you to my home?
FO300001849	My my my. You certainly do look a little bit worn out from your travels.
FO300001850	Oh, just look at my terrible manners! I'm Agatha. It's so nice to meet you.
FO300001851	Now, what brings you all the way out here?
FO300001852	Have you decided to find me a violin?
FO300001853	You do actually know how to plant mines, right?
FO300001854	The robots are over in the junkyard, in case you're wondering.
FO300001855	Are you going to show us how to fix the robots?
FO300001856	So are you going to ever show us how to be sneaky so we can hide from the Super Mutants?
FO300001857	I'm getting bored. I thought you were going to teach us something.
FO300001858	Go on, I'm watching. Show us what to do.
FO300001859	I'm confused. What am I supposed to be doing? Can you show me?
FO300001860	We're all watching you waiting to learn something. Well. Get on with it already!
FO300001861	Go on. I'm paying attention. Show us what to do.
FO300001862	Well, hotshot. Are you going to teach us something, or just stand there looking stupid?
FO300001863	Oooh. I can't wait. Show us what to do!
FO300001864	I'm watching. Go on. Teach us what to do.
FO300001865	I'm glad to be safely back home!
FO300001866	Quick! Unlock the door!
FO300001867	You've got to get this door unlocked!
FO300001868	You're rescuing me? Let's get the hell out of here!
FO300001869	You're rescuing Shorty and me?! Thanks! I thought we were goners for sure.
FO300001870	You're rescuing me?! Thanks! I thought we were goners for sure.
FO300001871	You're rescuing me?! Thanks! I thought we were goners for sure.
FO300001872	We can talk back at Big Town. Let's get out of here!
FO300001873	I'll feel better once we're safe.
FO300001874	Thank God! Who are you? Never mind, I don't care right now. Let's go get Red and get out of here!
FO300001875	Come on, you've got to untie me!
FO300001876	Thanks! Who are you? Never mind, I don't care right now. Let's go get Red and get out of here!
FO300001877	You lead. I'll follow. Let's go! Move it!
FO300001878	No more talking! Let's get out of here!
FO300001879	What's the hold up?
FO300001880	Who are you? And why do I have the feeling that you have some bad news?
FO300001881	They're dead. Aren't they?
FO300001882	Hey! Who are you?
FO300001883	Thanks for helping us. I just hope we can survive another attack. Probably won't.
FO300001884	Where's Red?
FO300001885	So what, you here to make fun of me or something?
FO300001886	I can't believe you sold me to Slavers! Why would you do that to me?
FO300001887	What's the matter with you? Leave me alone!
FO300001888	Get away from me! I never wanna see you again!
FO300001889	I got a lot of stuff to get together. Can't wait to get to Paradise Falls!
FO300001890	I got a lot of stuff to get together. Can't wait to get to Rivet City!
FO300001891	I got a lot of stuff to get together. Can't wait to get to Little Lamplight!
FO300001892	Checking up on me or something?
FO300001893	Your arrival is most unexpected, but not entirely unwelcome.
FO300001894	My friend! I see I've found you at last!
FO300001895	I knew you had survived, and I had hoped to assist in your rescue to repay my debt to you.
FO300001896	You're a real hero the way you handled the Ghouls.
FO300001897	I was worried about those Ghouls. Now I can get back to worrying about important things, like what color to dye my hair. Thanks for everything!
FO300001898	You're amazing. The way you handled those Ghouls. Good show!
FO300001899	Guess we can try living with the Ghouls.
FO300001900	I hope those Ghouls try to get along with us civilized people.
FO300001901	Hello, hello!
FO300001902	I'm mighty appreciative of your straightening things out. Perhaps next time I go on safari I'll take you along.
FO300001903	Is there something you require?
FO300001904	Thank you for dealing with those Ghouls. You're a real hero.
FO300001905	Thanks for helping those Ghouls. They really aren't so bad.
FO300001906	Good to see you!
FO300001907	Good job removing our little pest problem!
FO300001908	Hello friend!
FO300001909	I have nothing to say to you. Except this: Watch your back!
FO300001910	Hrmph.
FO300001911	You did it! You got rid of those vile creatures! Good show!
FO300001912	Yes, dear?
FO300001913	You'll get yours soon enough.
FO300001914	Goodbye!
FO300001915	Hello friend. Thanks for handling those Ghouls.
FO300001916	Hello friend. Ghoul physiology is fascinating!
FO300001917	Hello friend!
FO300001918	Those Ghouls wont be bothering us anymore, will they?
FO300001919	Hello!
FO300001920	Come to pour salt into the wound? Well, I won't stand for it!
FO300001921	Zombie-lover!
FO300001922	Things have been perfectly fabulous since you exterminated that filthy vermin!
FO300001923	Fabulous!
FO300001924	You think I want to talk to you?
FO300001925	You've ruined my life!
FO300001926	Comrade! Hero of the people! Hello!
FO300001927	Hey comrade! Those Ghoul's seem like a real community, hey? Adversity must have made them strong.
FO300001928	Greetings hero-comrade!
FO300001929	You're all my husband talks about now. Do you have any idea how annoying that is?
FO300001930	I miss my husband. He would have really liked you I think.
FO300001931	Hello!
FO300001932	Hey! I'm sure glad to have you around. That Gustavo's a real loser compared to you!
FO300001933	Hey there!
FO300001934	Take a real good look, because you won't be getting any of this!
FO300001935	Hah! I'm doing just fine, no thanks to you!
FO300001936	What do YOU want?
FO300001937	You're a lot tougher than you look, kid.
FO300001938	Glad to see you were able to convince these people to open their minds a little. Those Ghouls will liven things up around here for a long time!
FO300001939	Hello fellow adventurer!
FO300001940	Haha! Look at this mess. We'll have it cleaned up soon. Then it will be a Ghoul haven.
FO300001941	Ha ha! Hey there bud. Thanks again for helping us get in here!
FO300001942	Hey there bud!
FO300001943	Well, it'll take a little elbow grease but then this place will be a true home!
FO300001944	Oh, hello there! Can't thank you enough!
FO300001945	Hi again!
FO300001946	Bastards. Could have done it the easy way and just let us live here with them. Oh well. Guess we better get started with the clean up.
FO300001947	Hey kid. I was wrong about you. Good job!
FO300001948	Hey kid, how's it going?
FO300001949	Must admit, you did good soldier. I'm glad to have you around.
FO300001950	Don't know how you did it. I'd never allow those zombies room and board. But as long as Tenpenny keeps paying me I'll stay.
FO300001951	What?
FO300001952	Good job handling those zombies!
FO300001953	What's up? Kill any more zombies lately?
FO300001954	Hey soldier!
FO300001955	There you go! I hope you like it.
FO300001956	Oh good, you came back to visit!
FO300001957	Yay! You're back!
FO300001958	Hiya! Whatcha doing back here?
FO300001959	Get away from me! They'll find me next!
FO300001960	Hey there, hot stuff.
FO300001961	What?
FO300001962	I have no time to waste with you. Far more important matters await the attention of the AntAgonizer!
FO300001963	Really. Thanks for all your help, but I've got things I have to attend to.
FO300001964	I'm getting out of here!
FO300001965	I'm getting out of here!
FO300001966	I'm getting out of here!
FO300001967	Hey. We grabbed this on our last mission. Thought you might like it.
FO300001968	A badass like you, you deserve a cut of everything around here. Take it. It's yours.
FO300001969	Check this out. Me and a couple of the boys thought you could use a cut of the loot we picked up.
FO300001970	God help us all.
FO300001971	Okay, there you go. The computer is on again. Dunno what good it'll do you.
FO300001972	I'll get that computer turned on for you.
FO300001973	You have my condolences. Your father was a good man.
FO300001974	Please, not now.
FO300001975	Follow me. I'll show you what I can about Vault 87.
FO300001976	This map shows the locations of all known Vaults in the local area. Vault 87 has been highlighted for you, there.
FO300001977	Entrance to Vault 87 will be particularly difficult for you, I'm afraid.
FO300001978	Did you have any success with that old terminal?
FO300001979	Ah, you're back. You need something else now?
FO300001980	Yes? Is there something I can help you with?
FO300001981	I'm afraid I have other duties to attend to right now. If you find the computer to be helpful, there may be more I can offer.
FO300001982	May I start by saying that I am sorry for your loss. I was acquainted with your father, many years ago.
FO300001983	The world has lost one of its few remaining visionaries.
FO300001984	Rothchild should help you. But don't forget that he's Brotherhood. I've never trusted them. Be careful what you tell them.
FO300001985	I need to collect my wits, and figure out what to do next. Excuse me.
FO300001986	Can't you see I'm trying to have a conversation?
FO300001987	There must be something they can do.
FO300001988	Come with me. We need to talk to the leaders at once; they have to know what's happened out there.
FO300001989	There must be something they can do.
FO300001990	I need to speak with Scribe Rothchild and Elder Lyons. They must be told what is going on.
FO300001991	What are you looking at? You'd think you'd never seen a Ghoul up close before.
FO300001992	What the hell did you wake me up for, smoothskin? What are you staring at? You think you'd never seen a Ghoul up close before.
FO300001993	What now? You're starting to piss me off. Are you one of them Ghoul haters?
FO300001994	Back again, eh? Changed your mind? I still need to know if you have any problems with killing.
FO300001995	I thought you weren't interested in what I had to say?
FO300001996	Do you have those keys yet?
FO300001997	Are they all dead yet? Did you bring me any proof?
FO300001998	Is Tenpenny dead? God, I hope so.
FO300001999	Don't you have something to do?
FO300002000	How did you get past the guard? What do you want?
FO300002001	I haven't heard anything about Mister Crowley recently. So what could you possibly want?
FO300002002	Dude, you got your key. What do you want now?
FO300002003	Do you need more than that gift?
FO300002004	Here's the key. He never even noticed.
FO300002005	You've got your god damn key. Isn't that enough?
FO300002006	Good work! That's one less Radroach to deal with.
FO300002007	Let's get a picture together. Capture the moment.
FO300002008	Having trouble with that Radroach?
FO300002009	Something wrong? That Radroach is still over there.
FO300002010	Well, what do you think? You can come down here and shoot any time you want.
FO300002011	Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. Here are some more BBs.
FO300002012	If you're having trouble, try crouching to steady your aim.
FO300002013	Go ahead. Try out your new gun on those targets over there.
FO300002014	Come on. We'll show you the place.
FO300002015	Are you ready for your surprise?
FO300002016	Hey, that was Jonas on the intercom. He and I have been cooking up a little surprise present.
FO300002017	Jonas is waiting for you downstairs on the Reactor Level. Go ahead, I don't think anyone will mind if you slip out for a few minutes.
FO300002018	Just be patient. You don't want to ruin the surprise, do you? Go ahead, Jonas is waiting!
FO300002019	Are you all right? Is Butch giving you a hard time again?
FO300002020	Having a good time? It wasn't easy keeping this a secret! Now go on, I'm sure everyone else would like a chance to talk to the birthday boy.
FO300002021	Having a good time? It wasn't easy keeping this a secret! Now go on, I'm sure everyone else would like a chance to talk to the birthday girl.
FO300002022	Hey there, pal. Having fun?
FO300002023	Hi, honey. Having fun?
FO300002024	I can't believe you're 10 already. Your mother would have been proud of you, son. Now go on and enjoy your party!
FO300002025	I can't believe you're 10 already. Your mother would have been proud of you, honey. Now go on and enjoy your party!
FO300002026	Listen, once you finish being a good host, I have something I want to show you.
FO300002027	I hope you appreciate the effort Amata put into this party. She really seems to like you, for some reason.
FO300002028	Another youth well on his way to becoming a productive vault citizen!
FO300002029	Another youth well on her way to becoming a productive vault citizen!
FO300002030	Goodness, listen to me ramble! You're waiting for your present, aren't you?
FO300002031	Go ahead, you can eat the sweetroll now. It's your birthday!
FO300002032	You've grown up into such a fine young man. Your father must be very proud of you.
FO300002033	You've grown up into such a fine young lady. Your father must be very proud of you.
FO300002034	I don't have any more presents for you, if that's what you're wondering.
FO300002035	Go on now, I'm sure you've had quite enough old lady chitchat for one birthday!
FO300002036	Happy birthday, dearie! My goodness, I hope I didn't miss the party!
FO300002037	I hope you're having a good party! Did you read your poem yet? You know how to find it in your Pip-Boy, don't you?
FO300002038	I hope Butch didn't hurt you. Do you want to tell me what that was all about?
FO300002039	Happy birthday, sonny!
FO300002040	Happy birthday, missy!
FO300002041	Sounds like everybody's having a good time in there.
FO300002042	How do you like that Pip-Boy, son? Fit all right and everything?
FO300002043	How do you like that there Pip-Boy, miss? Fit all right and everything?
FO300002044	You let me know if that Pip-Boy ever gives you any trouble.
FO300002045	I am mortified about the cake mishap. Simply mortified.
FO300002046	Happy birthday! If you'll excuse me I'll have this cake sliced up for you in a jiffy.
FO300002047	I'm hungry and that stupid robot destroyed the cake.
FO300002048	Give me that sweetroll you got from Old Lady Palmer.
FO300002049	Mmm, that sweetroll was really good. You can tell Old Lady Palmer thanks for me. Ha ha ha!
FO300002050	So you're a tattletale, too. Just wait. Gomez isn't always going to be around to save your butt.
FO300002051	You're going to be really sorry you messed with me, punk.
FO300002052	Nice party, butt-head. Now get lost before I have to make you cry.
FO300002053	Didn't I tell you to stop bothering us? Shove off, dork.
FO300002054	My mom made me come to your stupid party, but don't expect me to hang out with you. Get lost, loser.
FO300002055	Why don't you go play dolls or something with your little friend Amata. No girls allowed.
FO300002056	Hey, I think your girlfriend Amata is looking for you. K-I-S-S-I-N-G. Ha ha ha.
FO300002057	Not as cool as my party though. Remember how my dad got Andy to do magic tricks? And we all played Hunt the Mutant in the Atrium?
FO300002058	Why are you still hanging around?
FO300002059	Hey, uh, thanks for inviting me. Really cool party and everything.
FO300002060	I know that, uh, Butch and I give you a hard time, but you don't take that seriously, right?
FO300002061	Get lost, butt-breath.
FO300002062	What's Butch's problem anyway? I can't believe he tried to start a fight at your own birthday party. What a jerk.
FO300002063	Butch is such an idiot. Just ignore him.
FO300002064	What happened with Butch? He looked awfully pleased with himself, which usually means something bad happened to somebody.
FO300002065	What'd Butch want? I thought you were in trouble there for a second.
FO300002066	Happy birthday! We really surprised you, didn't we?
FO300002067	Ha ha. Your dad was afraid you were onto us. But I told him not to worry. You're so easy to fool.
FO300002068	Having fun, I hope?
FO300002069	Happy birthday!
FO300002070	Go on, mingle!
FO300002071	Isn't this great?
FO300002072	Oh, hey, it's Jonas. Happy birthday! Sorry I couldn't be at your party. Listen, would you put your dad on?
FO300002073	Can you put your dad on, please?
FO300002074	What are you doing down here, young man? I thought kids weren't allowed down on the Reactor Level.
FO300002075	What are you doing down here, young lady? I thought kids weren't allowed down on the Reactor Level.
FO300002076	Your dad is waiting to give you your present. Or should we just keep it?
FO300002077	Happy birthday, buddy. I hope you have fun with it.
FO300002078	Happy birthday, darlin'. I hope you have fun with it.
FO300002079	Go on, shoot something for me!
FO300002080	Stand next to your dad and I'll get a nice picture of you and your new BB gun.
FO300002081	Well, hello there. You look like you could use a rest.
FO300002082	Oh, just look at my terrible manners! I'm Agatha. It's so nice to meet you.
FO300002083	Mmmm-hmmm. What's that you're carrying? Is it something else to taunt me with?
FO300002084	I told you to get the hell out and I meant it!
FO300002085	Sit down a spell and relax.
FO300002086	You're a sight for these old eyes.
FO300002087	Well, well. Look who the cat dragged in.
FO300002088	You came to visit! You'll never guess what I found out in the Wastes, when I was supposed to be patrolling.
FO300002089	Here. This is for you.
FO300002090	Oh, hi there! I'm Bittercup.
FO300002091	God, life is such a hassle, you know?
FO300002092	Hey. Don't get any bright ideas about trying anything. We may not look it, but every one of us is a trained killer.
FO300002093	Oh, who am I kidding? Look, we're in trouble here. If you want to help, great. If not, just please don't kill anyone while you're here.
FO300002094	I heard how you helped out Timebomb. I'm not sure why you did it, but thanks.  I only hope that he lives long enough to appreciate your help.
FO300002095	Now, did you need something?
FO300002096	Yeah? What is it?
FO300002097	What do you need, stranger?
FO300002098	I'm on patrol here, what do you want?
FO300002099	The more time I spend talking to you, the less time I'm watching for raids.
FO300002100	Wha-? Jesus. I'm on the lookout here, don't sneak up on me like that. What do you want?
FO300002101	A visitor? Who'd want to visit this hell hole? I bet you're here to rape and pillage us. Aren't you? Aren't you?!
FO300002102	Not that it matters. We're all Super Mutant snacks anyway.
FO300002103	Unless you're here to help us, fuck off.
FO300002104	You got a problem?
FO300002105	What do you want?
FO300002106	What?
FO300002107	I'll be alright though. What did you need?
FO300002108	I'll be alright though. What did you need?
FO300002109	I'll be alright though. What did you need?
FO300002110	Wow. I can't believe that you were able to help Timebomb. And here I was sure that you were ready to just let him die. I guess I had you wrong.
FO300002111	He still can't fight, but if we survive for a bit longer, he should be back into it soon enough.
FO300002112	Look, you're a better doc than me, that's pretty obvious. But if you need healing, I'll do it for you no charge.
FO300002113	Wow. I can't believe that you were able to help Timebomb. I thought he was done for.
FO300002114	He still can't fight, but if we survive for a bit longer, he should be back into it soon enough.
FO300002115	Look, you're a better doc than me, that's pretty obvious. But if you need healing, I'll do it for you no charge.
FO300002116	What is it?
FO300002117	What's up? Are you hurt?
FO300002118	Woa, looks like you've seen some action. Do you need help?
FO300002119	Are you hurt? You don't look hurt. What do you need?
FO300002120	Hey, pal. What's up?
FO300002121	Things are looking good here, bud.
FO300002122	Your fly's open! Haha, made ya look!
FO300002123	Heya! Whaddaya need?
FO300002124	Hey. Thanks again, man. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
FO300002125	Anything for you, man. What do you need?
FO300002126	Hey, it's good to see you. Is there something I can do for you? Anything?
FO300002127	Welcome to Big Town. Not that there's much of a town left. Those Super Mutants keep kidnapping people.
FO300002128	Hi there. Um, can I help you?
FO300002129	You need something?
FO300002130	They're out there. I can feel it. Uh, what? You? I gave you the welcoming speech.
FO300002131	Watch the Wastes. Keep track of movement. Uh, what? Did you need something?
FO300002132	Greetings, fellow survivor! Another fine day in the Wastes, isn't it?
FO300002133	Greetings, fellow survivor! The great work of rebuilding humanity must go forward!
FO300002134	Another Wasteland survivor, huh? Sorry, but I don't got enough to share. Get your own copy of the book and do your own hunting!
FO300002135	Glad to see a friendly face out here.
FO300002136	I swear, that damn book nearly ended me.
FO300002137	Whew! I thought I was a goner. You saved my life. Here, take this. It's the least I can do.
FO300002138	I'm afraid you're just bringing in too many slaves for us to keep up. Now Eulogy is pissed at us for not being as good as you.
FO300002139	First rule of competition: you can't lose if your competitor is dead. So long, fucker.
FO300002140	The hell do you want? We're busy.
FO300002141	Can I interest you in an extremely rare refreshment?
FO300002142	Quit gawking, smoothskin! We're headed over to Tenpenny Tower. We Ghouls own that place now. You smoothskins aren't allowed to live there anymore.
FO300002143	Quit gawking smoothskin! We’re on our way to Tenpenny Tower. You know anything about the tower?
FO300002144	We're done being oppressed by you smoothskins.
FO300002145	I was on my way to Megaton to do some trading when I heard somebody blew the place right off the map. Jesus.
FO300002146	Don't even think about it. That Enclave tech is mine, fair and square.
FO300002147	Help yourself. I don't think messing with the Enclave is a good idea.
FO300002148	I don't know about you, but those Enclave Eyebots give me the creeps.
FO300002149	You see these all over nowadays. I wonder what it means.
FO300002150	That'll make for some nice, juicy steaks. If you like ant, that is.
FO300002151	There's nothing better than fresh dog, don't you think? We'll be happy to set you up with something if you're hungry.
FO300002152	Nasty brute, but tasty once you get the fur off.
FO300002153	Hello, stranger. I'm Tinker Joe, premier supplier of robotic parts and service throughout the DC Wasteland.
FO300002154	Remember me? Tinker Joe, at your service. Robots for sale, robots serviced while you wait. Interested?
FO300002155	Yes? Did you need something else?
FO300002156	I am not for sale. I am only a demonstration model. Tinker Joe will be glad to handle any of your robotic needs. Have a nice day.
FO300002157	Damned shame about those slaves. Would've fetched us a nice pile of caps at Paradise Falls.
FO300002158	Hey, we're looking for some slaves that ran off. Seen 'em? They can't have gone far.
FO300002159	We got away from the Slavers who were taking us to Paradise Falls, but they said our collars were explosive. Blow our heads off if we ran.
FO300002160	Do you think you can get this thing off of me before it's too late?
FO300002161	Thanks for not attacking us. Most people don't tolerate Ghouls.
FO300002162	Please, help me! You've got to get this collar off of me!
FO300002163	Come on. Help me get this collar off. Please.
FO300002164	I'm heading to the Temple of the Union. They take care of escaped slaves.
FO300002165	Maybe you could tell any other slaves you meet about it.
FO300002166	You saved me from those bastards. I won't forget it.
FO300002167	What do you need? I can get you a fix. Anything you want. Cheap, too! Check it out!
FO300002168	Hey man, relax. We can do business.
FO300002169	Shh. Not too loud. I don't really want people to know that we're doin' business.
FO300002170	Hey, good to see you again. What do you need?
FO300002171	I'm not in the mood for you, asshole.
FO300002172	Yeah, I remember you. What's up?
FO300002173	Whoa, whoa. Slow down there. This area's off limits to everyone but the Family. Where the hell do you think you're going?
FO300002174	Yeah? What do you want this time?
FO300002175	I thought I knew everyone in the Family, but I don't recognize you. You must be one of Vance's new initiates.
FO300002176	My name's Justin, I'm pretty new here myself.
FO300002177	Hello.
FO300002178	You gonna gawk all day or are you gonna buy something?
FO300002179	I don't think I've met you yet. The name's Alan. What did you want?
FO300002180	What is it?
FO300002181	Hey there.
FO300002182	Whatcha need?
FO300002183	Always a pleasure. What can I do for you?
FO300002184	I trust your talk with young Ian went well.
FO300002185	I am quite interested in learning the results of your discussion. Did he come to a decision?
FO300002186	I hear that you decided to speak to Ian regardless of my warnings.
FO300002187	Be that as it may, I am still interested in what you conversed about. Did he come to a decision?
FO300002188	Welcome to our home.
FO300002189	My people call me Vance. I lead this group of weary travelers and outcasts who need a home.
FO300002190	And to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?
FO300002191	You wish to speak to me again?
FO300002192	Hey there, sweetie!
FO300002193	...
FO300002194	Hello? Is this the mailman? Oh I do hope my fall catalog has arrived!
FO300002195	You must be exhausted from all that walking in this horrible heat. Oh, and hungry too! Sit, please!
FO300002196	Brailee Ewers is the name. Don't mind my husband Kenneth. He woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning!
FO300002197	Whatcha' need darling?
FO300002198	...
FO300002199	I'm sorry, but my husband told me to say that nobody's here.
FO300002200	We aren't talking any more. Get out!
FO300002201	What are you doing in here?
FO300002202	What the hell are you doing in here?! Get the fuck out!
FO300002203	Look, I want to be left alone. Can't you tell?
FO300002204	...
FO300002205	Yes? Who is it?
FO300002206	It's nice to see a friendly new face around here. It's been a long time.
FO300002207	The name's Karen Schenzy.
FO300002208	What's up?
FO300002209	...
FO300002210	Go away! You're not getting in here!
FO300002211	I thought I told you I didn't want to talk to you any more! I'm not going home and that's it!
FO300002212	I wanted to thank you one last time for what you've done for me.
FO300002213	Thanks again for helping me clear my thoughts.
FO300002214	Huh? What do you want?
FO300002215	Yeah? What is it this time?
FO300002216	Well, holy shit! You're back!
FO300002217	What the hell happened out there?
FO300002218	How's the search going? Any sign of Ian?
FO300002219	What did they tell you? Everyone ok?
FO300002220	Don't you have some houses to be checking?
FO300002221	Hang on, you're not one of them. I nearly blasted you in two!
FO300002222	Get over here before they spot you.
FO300002223	Now, what the hell are you doin' all the way out here?
FO300002224	You again, huh? What is it now?
FO300002225	Any word about my brother? I'm worried sick!
FO300002226	I really appreciate you doing this for me. I'm feeling better already!
FO300002227	Did you need something else?
FO300002228	I don't recognize you. New in town or something?
FO300002229	You still up for that job I was talking about?
FO300002230	Look, I don't have anything to offer you except these supplies. I don't know why they didn't take it.
FO300002231	Oh my God! I thought I was dead! You saved me!
FO300002232	There's a bomb strapped to me! You've got to disarm it, quick!
FO300002233	Help me! I'm wired with explosives!
FO300002234	Help! This bomb is about to go off!
FO300002235	Thanks! You saved my life!
FO300002236	Alright. Let's go.
FO300002237	Talk to-
FO300002238	Salutations, Commander! Sergeant RL-3, Gutsy-class robotic soldier, reporting for duty!
FO300002239	You will come to regret your actions.
FO300002240	You should be proud of your accomplishment.
FO300002241	I hope you're here to turn yourself in, young man. You're already in enough trouble as it is. Don't make it worse for yourself.
FO300002242	I hope you're here to turn yourself in, young lady. You're already in enough trouble as it is. Don't make it worse for yourself.
FO300002243	I have nothing else to say to you.
FO300002244	Please, just go. I already said everything I had to say.
FO300002245	I'm waiting to make sure you leave. Now get going.
FO300002246	Go on! Before security comes. Be careful out there!
FO300002247	I'm just waiting for you to leave so I can close the door and go back to pretending my life is perfect.
FO300002248	There's nothing else for you here. You're an outsider now. You know, the people who are supposed to stay on the other side of this door.
FO300002249	Please, you need to go before someone comes. Be careful out there.
FO300002250	I thought you didn't need my help. The door's open. Go through it.
FO300002251	You told me to get out of your way, so I'm going. Goodbye.
FO300002252	Don't bother trying to apologize. Just get out of here before it's too late!
FO300002253	You've got to get out of here. Someone's sure to come see what's going on. Take care!
FO300002254	Good. You're leaving. I guess you were trying to help me. But you... You didn't have to kill him!
FO300002255	When the warning sirens came on, they all ran out. I guess that was you. I see you got the door open. That's good.
FO300002256	Were you going to leave without even saying goodbye?
FO300002257	You did it! You opened the door! My God, I almost didn't believe it was possible.
FO300002258	My God, what have you done? You killed him! Why would you kill my father?
FO300002259	Get away from me! I can't talk to you right now.
FO300002260	Here. Take it. I don't want it any more. I don't know what I'd do if still had the gun and my father came looking for me.
FO300002261	Here. Take the gun. I don't want to find out what I'd do if I still had the gun when my father comes looking for me.
FO300002262	Thank you! I told you my father wasn't himself. I don't know what he might have done if you hadn't come along.
FO300002263	You need to go. I'll try to meet you by the vault door. Be careful.
FO300002264	Come on, you've got to wake up!
FO300002265	Well, look who's come crawling back. What do you want?
FO300002266	Back again? Did you forget something?
FO300002267	What are you waiting for? You said you'd help her!
FO300002268	You coming too? Hey, I could sure use some help. Come on!
FO300002269	It's no use! I've got to get away from these damned roaches!
FO300002270	Did you change your mind? Are you going to help my mom after all?
FO300002271	We did it! My mom's gonna be okay! You're the best friend I've ever had, man!
FO300002272	Hey, I know it isn't much, but I want you to have my Tunnel Snakes jacket. Go ahead, take it.
FO300002273	You're the best, man. The best. Everything's gonna be okay now, thanks to you!
FO300002274	She's dead! She's dead and you could have helped and you didn't. Get away from me!
FO300002275	Just go away and leave me alone.
FO300002276	You gotta help me! My mom's trapped in there with the Radroaches!
FO300002277	You're lucky it was me who found you. The others won't be so forgiving.
FO300002278	I don't know what you're up to and I don't want to know. Just clear out of here and I'll pretend I never saw you.
FO300002279	Come on, kid, get out of here before you get us both killed!
FO300002280	Just keep your hands where I can see them.
FO300002281	Come on, sit down and have a drink with me.
FO300002282	God! I could really use a drink right now!
FO300002283	Me and Andy were in a tight spot there, ain't no mistake. Good thing he loves toasting roaches so much.
FO300002284	I'm not sure how I could help.
FO300002285	Those nasty roaches have gotten my circuits in such a frazzle!
FO300002286	We're getting out of here. Now's our chance!
FO300002287	Tom wouldn't listen to me. You know how he gets.
FO300002288	Think you can take charge of the gang by getting rid of me?
FO300002289	Hey, man. Can I come with you again? This place sucks.
FO300002290	About time you got back. I got a full clip and an empty flask. Time we fixed that, huh?
FO300002291	What's up?
FO300002292	What's the story, my fellow Tunnel Snake?
FO300002293	You got something to say to the Butch-man?
FO300002294	Physical violence on your part invalidates our contract.
FO300002295	You return. Shall I join you once again?
FO300002296	You return. Shall I join you once again?
FO300002297	I don't like the look of this place.
FO300002298	What do you need?
FO300002299	Yes? What is it?
FO300002300	Oh, it's been too long since I got to play rough.
FO300002301	Oh! You came back! Do you want me to back you up, lover?
FO300002302	Can we go yet?
FO300002303	Yes, lover?
FO300002304	Bottlecap for your thoughts.
FO300002305	<growl!>
FO300002306	<pant> <pant>
FO300002307	<pant> <pant>
FO300002308	<bark>
FO300002309	<bark!>
FO300002310	<bark>
FO300002311	<bark> <bark!>
FO300002312	Oh, fuck no. I don't take that shit from anyone. You're dead!
FO300002313	What the fuck, man? I've been standing here forever!
FO300002314	Yeah? What is it?
FO300002315	What're we standing around here for when there's plenty of action around?
FO300002316	Yeah, kid? What do you need?
FO300002317	Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'. Boo hoo. Megaton blew up.
FO300002318	These fuckers deserved what they got.
FO300002319	Now, can we get out of here? Or should I just keep waiting next to this stinking hole?
FO300002320	Can we get out of here? Or should I just keep waiting next to this stinking hole?
FO300002321	Yeah? What the fuck do you want now?
FO300002322	It saddens me that it has come to this. Farewell, my friend.
FO300002323	I had hoped you'd return. What now?
FO300002324	You have something to say?
FO300002325	What have you got on your mind?
FO300002326	Something troubling you, my friend?
FO300002327	Something troubling you, my friend?
FO300002328	If you're going to get yourself killed out here, you mind doing it further away from our bunker?
FO300002329	I don't want your corpse stinking up our little patch of heaven.
FO300002330	Shut up. Kinda busy.
FO300002331	Back to stare in awe at the Outcasts? Don't you have something better to do, kid?
FO300002332	Defender Rococo Rockfowl, at your service.
FO300002333	Might want to watch your head around here, miss.
FO300002334	Defender Rococo Rockfowl, at your service.
FO300002335	Gotta be careful out here, mister.
FO300002336	Hey. Make it quick, huh?
FO300002337	I'm Protector Henry Casdin, leader of the Outcasts. This had better be good.
FO300002338	Normally, I wouldn't be wasting my time talking to a local, but Morgan tells me you can make yourself useful.
FO300002339	So, interested in collecting technology for us?
FO300002340	Changed your mind about the job, yet?
FO300002341	Well, look who it is. What have you got for us, today?
FO300002342	If it isn't our local scavenger-for-hire. What've you found for us, today?
FO300002343	Always good to see you. What have you brought for us?
FO300002344	Ah, good to see you back. What've you got for us today?
FO300002345	Hold on! You're a new face, and around here, new faces tend to get shot.
FO300002346	You'd better explain yourself, before I have to ask again, with lead.
FO300002347	I suggest you get going now, before I start shooting.
FO300002348	You had your warning.
FO300002349	My name's Clover. I hear you're the new man in my life.
FO300002350	You're looking for a bodyguard, and I'm looking for a body. Sounds like we're going to have some fun times, lover.
FO300002351	My name's Clover. I hear you're the new woman in my life.
FO300002352	You're looking for a bodyguard, and I'm looking for a body. Sounds like we're going to have some fun times, lover.
FO300002353	Look, no offense, but I've got some heavy things to think about. Just go tell Zimmer I'm waiting for him.
FO300002354	Look. I appreciate you're helping with Zimmer, but I really just want to put this all behind me. So I'm going to pretend none of that happened.
FO300002355	Now, is there something I can help you with citizen?
FO300002356	You've been rather busy lately. Asking questions. "Investigating." So, is that it? You're some kind of investigator? A detective for hire?
FO300002357	Or do you have some kind of personal grudge against an innocent android who simply wants to be left alone? Please, tell me. I'd really like to know.
FO300002358	Was there something else?
FO300002359	You did a good thing, delivering that component to Zimmer. Telling him the android was dead. For that, I'm going entrust you with some information.
FO300002360	The android's transformation was done by a man named Pinkerton, here in Rivet City. He's hidden down in the broken fore section of the ship.
FO300002361	You'll need to swim to reach him, but if you're inclined, Pinkerton can perform a facial reconstruction on you as well.
FO300002362	We'd best not be seen speaking with each other further. If you want a new face, see Pinkerton, down in the flooded fore section  of the carrier.
FO300002363	The android's transformation was done by a man named Pinkerton, here in Rivet City. He's hidden down in the broken fore section of the ship.
FO300002364	You'll need to swim to reach him, but if you're inclined, Pinkerton can perform a facial reconstruction on you as well.
FO300002365	Wow! What luck!
FO300002366	Hey mungo. This is an A B conversation so C your way out.
FO300002367	Are we there yet?
FO300002368	I can't wait to get to Big Town!
FO300002369	You want to go to Big Town? Of course you do!
FO300002370	Yeah! I made it to Big Town! Big Town! Hurray! Now I just need to find Red.
FO300002371	Can't talk now. We've heard Slavers are attacking.
FO300002372	Go away! Hannibal is waiting for you.
FO300002373	What are we going to do? Those Slavers have captured the Memorial.
FO300002374	My feet are sore. It's a long way to the Lincoln Memorial
FO300002375	Hannibal says you're on our side. My name is Alejandra.
FO300002376	What? Oh! I didn't see you there. I get that way sometimes when I'm thinking.
FO300002377	Excuse me, sir. I can't talk now. Slavers could any moment.
FO300002378	Excuse me, ma'am. I can't talk now. Slavers could any moment.
FO300002379	I don't talk to strangers. You need to go talk to Hannibal.
FO300002380	Please, sir. Help us get rid of all those Slavers in the Memorial.
FO300002381	Please, ma'am. Help us get rid of all those Slavers in the Memorial.
FO300002382	I hope our brahmin survives this trip.
FO300002383	My name is Bill. Bill Seward, if you please, sir.
FO300002384	My name is Bill. Bill Seward, if you please, ma'am.
FO300002385	Yes, sir. What can I do for you sir?
FO300002386	Yes, ma'am. What can I do for you ma'am?
FO300002387	Not now. We can talk after the Slaver attack.
FO300002388	Don't you be stopping here, mister. You got to talk to Hannibal first.
FO300002389	Don't you be stopping here, lady. You got to talk to Hannibal first.
FO300002390	We've got to get those Slavers cleared out of the Memorial.
FO300002391	I'm sure Hannibal is cooking up a plan.
FO300002392	This is a glorious day. We will rebuild Lincoln's Memorial. I hope I can reattach his head.
FO300002393	I'm sure Hannibal is cooking up a plan.
FO300002394	You're new. I'm Caleb. If you're going to be staying a while, I could use some help.
FO300002395	You have a picture! And such a large one, too.
FO300002396	I'll have no problems restoring the Memorial with this. Thank you!
FO300002397	Make it quick. I've got a lot of work to do.
FO300002398	Those Slavers are all dead. We must stay vigilant. There may be more of them.
FO300002399	We got wind that the Slavers are going to attack. We could really use your help in the fight.
FO300002400	Ah, a visitor. Welcome to the Temple of the Union.
FO300002401	I'm not going to ask you who you are. For the moment, I don't care.
FO300002402	We are all escaped slaves. I need your solemn promise not to betray us to Paradise Falls or the Slavers.
FO300002403	Until I get that, you cannot leave here. So, do I have your word?
FO300002404	Are you ready to pledge your allegiance?
FO300002405	Everything is done? I can hardly believe it. We are finally going to realize the dream!
FO300002406	We'll start out within the hour. We'll meet you at the site.
FO300002407	I hear you found a great picture for Caleb. Once the Memorial site is safe, we can move there.
FO300002408	So the Super Mutants are dead? This is wonderful news!
FO300002409	Now all you have to do is get Caleb his picture and we can begin our journey.
FO300002410	Slavers! They're holed up in the Memorial.
FO300002411	In a moment we will charge them. We will have liberty or we will have death! Join with us to defeat evil!
FO300002412	Those Slavers are still in control of the Memorial.
FO300002413	Is it time for us to attack yet?
FO300002414	We made it! The Memorial is really ours! I cannot thank you enough.
FO300002415	Here, take this. It's a token of our thanks.
FO300002416	Thanks to you, we are able to make this journey.
FO300002417	We will rebuild the great Memorial to Lincoln and give hope to slaves everywhere!
FO300002418	What is it?
FO300002419	You have been good to your word. You are welcome at the Temple of the Union anytime.
FO300002420	Take these schematics as a token of our gratitude.
FO300002421	Ah! It is our newest brother! What can I do for you?
FO300002422	Ah! It is our newest sister! What can I do for you?
FO300002423	I'm Leroy Walker, and you're probably wondering about what we're doing here.
FO300002424	Yeah, I killed them all after telling you not to.
FO300002425	I just couldn't trust anyone else to do it. I needed to see them dead with my own eyes.
FO300002426	Anyway, the problem has been taken care of. I can go back to Paradise Falls now.
FO300002427	I'll make sure they know you're our kind of people. You'll be welcome there any time.
FO300002428	You just couldn't wait for us, could you? Well, at least they're all dead. Guess I'll go back to Paradise Falls.
FO300002429	We are just about to wipe out this Temple of the Union. You can join us or not. It makes no difference to me.
FO300002430	We're preparing for a slave attack. Just stay out of the way.
FO300002431	So did you find any Lincoln artifacts in the Museum?
FO300002432	Is there something else?
FO300002433	Not now. Slavers are out there somewhere, preparing to attack.
FO300002434	Now, beat it! Hannibal is waiting for you.
FO300002435	What's your business stranger?
FO300002436	You again. Don't dawdle. Get in here.
FO300002437	You ain't supposed to be looking at me, to say nothing of talking to me.
FO300002438	Now, beat it! Hannibal is waiting for you.
FO300002439	Goddamn Slavers have the Memorial.
FO300002440	As soon as Hannibal gives the word, we're going to charge in there and take it from them.
FO300002441	Stay sharp. The Wasteland is dangerous.
FO300002442	You don't look like much, stranger. Bet you run from Radroaches.
FO300002443	I'm Simone Cameron. Don't fuck with me. Hannibal says I can't shoot you, but I ain't trusting you with a gun to my back.
FO300002444	Are you trying to piss me off?
FO300002445	That's close enough. What the hell are you doing wandering around here?
FO300002446	Keep moving. Mister Walker is waiting.
FO300002447	Oh. You again.
FO300002448	What do you want?
FO300002449	I heard you're going to help us get those runaways.
FO300002450	Make it quick. I'm busy.
FO300002451	Well, if it isn't "my hero," the guy who sprang me from the Vault! I think I owe this man a drink!
FO300002452	Well, if it isn't my best gal, the one who sprung me from the Vault! I think I owe this lovely lady a drink!
FO300002453	How's it hanging?
FO300002454	Hey, what's the word?
FO300002455	Stay away from me! This is all your fault!
FO300002456	I really do have to get back to the vault. Good to see you again, though.
FO300002457	What have you done? The Vault is done for!
FO300002458	What are we going to do now? You've ruined everything!
FO300002459	This is all your fault! You've ruined the Vault! You'll pay!
FO300002460	You did me a great favor with those keys. How do you like my new armor? Those keys led me right to it.
FO300002461	You stole what was rightfully mine! Get lost.
FO300002462	You did me a great favor with those keys. I know just how to use them.
FO300002463	Thanks for not croaking me, dude.
FO300002464	Hey! It's my favorite wanker! I so fucking glad I talked you out of putting a bullet in my brain. Hah ha!
FO300002465	Hey! It's my favorite bitch assassin! Hah ha! I so fucking glad I talked you out of putting a bullet in my brain!
FO300002466	I presume you are still honoring our previous arrangement? I enjoy being alive, at least for the moment.
FO300002467	I'm guessing that you've come about the notice. You know, I've heard about you.
FO300002468	You're not bad people, from what I understand. And the Regulators can always use good folks.
FO300002469	So, what do you say? You read the notice, and you're here, so I'm guessing that you want to ride with us. Am I right?
FO300002470	You live the life of a Regulator. You're an example to all.
FO300002471	Word reaches across the Wastes of your deeds. I am honored to have you among us.
FO300002472	It's always good to see one of our number here. Have you brought tales and trophies of justice?
FO300002473	The Regulators welcome you back.
FO300002474	The unrighteous will be punished.
FO300002475	We bring law to a lawless land.
FO300002476	We are justice. We are the law.
FO300002477	Sonora is our leader. Speak with her.
FO300002478	Stay true to yourself and to the law. This is the rule of the Regulator.
FO300002479	Surely you have someplace better to be than hanging around my classroom?
FO300002480	Well, according to this, you're in line to be trained as a Laundry Cannon Operator. First time for everything, indeed.
FO300002481	It's nice to know I can still be surprised. Pedicurist! I might have guessed manicurist or even masseuse, but apparently you're a foot person.
FO300002482	It says here you're perfectly suited for a career as a Waste Management Specialist. A specialist, mind you, not just a dabbler. Congratulations!
FO300002483	Looks like the diner's going to get a new Fry Cook. I'll just say this once: hold the mustard, extra pickles. Ha ha ha.
FO300002484	Thank goodness. We're finally getting a new Jukebox Technician. That thing hasn't worked right since old Joe Palmer passed.
FO300002485	Well, well. Pip-Boy Programmer, eh? Stanley will finally have someone to talk shop with.
FO300002486	Huh. I wonder who will be brave enough to be your first customer as the vault's new Tattoo Artist? I promise it won't be me.
FO300002487	Apparently you're management material. You're going to be trained as a Shift Supervisor.
FO300002488	Could I be talking to the next Overseer? Stranger things have happened.
FO300002489	Wow. Wow. Says here you're going to be the vault's Marriage Counselor.
FO300002490	Almost makes me want to get married, just to be able to avail myself of your services.
FO300002491	I always thought you'd have a career in professional sports. You're the new vault Little League coach! Congratulations.
FO300002492	All set, eh? You shouldn't have had any trouble with this little formality.
FO300002493	You managed to answer all the questions, I see. That's a good start. Maybe a bit more than I expected given your grades.
FO300002494	Well, you made it. All set for the G.O.A.T.? Trust me, it really isn't that bad. Just something everybody has to go through.
FO300002495	Do you mind? I know to you it's just meaningless jabber, but I'm actually trying to teach here.
FO300002496	Feel free to stick around if you want, but I don't want you disrupting the test.
FO300002497	As soon as everyone takes their seats we can get started.
FO300002498	No more excuses from you children! Go in and sit down.
FO300002499	Buzz off, nosebleed.
FO300002500	You're all right, kid. See you around.
FO300002501	This isn't over, punk.
FO300002502	I look like I want to chit-chat, nosebleed? What, you want another beating?
FO300002503	Hey, look. It's smart mouth. Afraid I ain't got time for your fancy words right now. So beat it.
FO300002504	Look, I'm not looking to rumble with you. How about we just stay out of each other's business, like usual.
FO300002505	Yeah? What do you want?
FO300002506	Don't mess with the Tunnel Snakes.
FO300002507	What is it, feeb?
FO300002508	Look, square, I already told you: we got nothin' to say to each other.
FO300002509	Leave me alone, you little spaz.
FO300002510	Tunnel Snakes rule!
FO300002511	What? What do you want, nerd?
FO300002512	Oh look, it's Doc's kid. Great. What you do want, nerdboy?
FO300002513	Oh look, it's Doc's kid. Great. What you do want, nerdgirl?
FO300002514	You again! What'd I tell you about talking to me, huh? I don't want to catch a case of the nerd from you!
FO300002515	Hey, hey, hey, sport! It's been a while since you stopped in here to see us! It's the big G.O.A.T. day today, right?
FO300002516	Good luck with the G.O.A.T., buddy!
FO300002517	Good luck with the G.O.A.T., cutie!
FO300002518	Shh. I'm trying to concentrate.
FO300002519	I heard what you said. Why would you do that? Just leave me alone!
FO300002520	Thanks for your help, jerk. It's good to know I can count on you when I'm in trouble.
FO300002521	Thank God that's over. Come on, let's go get some lunch.
FO300002522	Thanks for getting rid of them. Assholes.
FO300002523	I don't know why they won't leave me alone. Just because my father is the Overseer, I guess. Idiots.
FO300002524	Stupid Tunnel Snakes! Immature assholes, if you ask me.
FO300002525	Why won't they leave me alone? It's not my fault my father's the Overseer. I don't care about their stupid gang!
FO300002526	Can you talk to them? Maybe Butch will listen to you. Please?
FO300002527	Go on, now. You've got a G.O.A.T. to take.
FO300002528	Come on, pal. You're fine, and you know it.
FO300002529	You're a perfectly healthy 16-year-old boy.
FO300002530	So, you need to get to class and take your G.O.A.T. exam. No excuses.
FO300002531	Come on, honey. You're fine, and you know it.
FO300002532	You're a perfectly healthy 16-year-old girl.
FO300002533	So, you need to get to class and take your G.O.A.T. exam. No excuses.
FO300002534	I'm a little worried <coughs> I hope Jonas can take a look at me soon.
FO300002535	Hey, what did you put for #10?
FO300002536	Stop bothering me, I've just got to figure out this last one!
FO300002537	I can't figure out #5. First I think I should listen to my grandmother. But then, isn't killing someone wrong?
FO300002538	I'm thinking of going with "Overseer" for the last one. What did you put?
FO300002539	Hey, why don't you have to take the test?
FO300002540	You nervous? I'm not.
FO300002541	Shh!
FO300002542	We're not friends. We're never going to be friends. Got it?
FO300002543	Right now, I don't pay any attention to you. You really want to keep it that way, okay?
FO300002544	I hope you weren't just talking to me.
FO300002545	Mr. Brotch is a big fat liar!
FO300002546	Do you mind? I'm trying to pay attention.
FO300002547	Oh. Hi. Why are you talking to me?
FO300002548	You never should have left, kid. Now, we'll make sure nobody ever leaves again!
FO300002549	I'm sorry, but you have to leave. Goodbye.
FO300002550	Our business is finished. Please leave immediately.
FO300002551	It's a shame you've got to go. But you'll do okay out there, I'm sure.
FO300002552	It's a shame you've got to go. But you'll do okay out there, I'm sure.
FO300002553	Goodbye. We'll miss you.
FO300002554	Good riddance. Get out.
FO300002555	Stay back!
FO300002556	Stay out of this!
FO300002557	Well, I see you've returned.
FO300002558	Done with the dust and ruins of the Wasteland, are you? Given up looking for daddy? Thought you could just slink back in, like a teen missing curfew?
FO300002559	Well, that's too bad. You have no future in this Vault. You're tainted.
FO300002560	You just couldn't let us live in peace, could you? You couldn't have a home, so you decided to destroy ours.
FO300002561	But I'll see to it that you die first!
FO300002562	You just couldn't let us live in peace, could you? You couldn't have a home, so you've decided to destroy ours.
FO300002563	Wait a minute! It's you! I hardly recognized you with all the dust and grime from out there.
FO300002564	Guess that explains how you got that door open. You've got more experience with it than most everyone down here combined.
FO300002565	I guess you can see how bad things are down here. Sorry, where were we going?
FO300002566	Make it quick.
FO300002567	I heard you were leaving us. That's not really true, is it?
FO300002568	I really shouldn't be seen talking with you, you know. What do you want?
FO300002569	I've gotta say, it's a shame to see you go. I still remember when you turned ten. Who could have guessed how you'd grow up?
FO300002570	Hey, if it ain't a fellow Tunnel Snake, slumming it down here with the old crew?
FO300002571	I thought you'd be out there tearing up the Wasteland and raising Hell!
FO300002572	But if you've gotta be back, might as well make yourself useful. You gotta help us.
FO300002573	Damn, look who's come waltzing back into the Vault?
FO300002574	It takes some real balls coming back here after everything you and your dad screwed up.
FO300002575	But if you've gotta be back, might as well make yourself useful. You gotta help us.
FO300002576	Hey, what's the word?
FO300002577	Oh my God, you're back! You got my message and actually came back!
FO300002578	Oh, thank goodness you're here! I told everyone to wait here for you, that you'd know what to do, but they didn't listen to me.
FO300002579	With everything they'd been through, they just panicked. But I knew you'd come back.
FO300002580	I knew you'd know what was happening. You do, don't you?
FO300002581	I'll keep looking for the others. Good luck with everything.
FO300002582	Did you think I was joking? You murderer!
FO300002583	You've already made your point with us. What else is there to say?
FO300002584	It sounds like you've already abandoned us. Did you change your mind, or are you just here to make fun of us?
FO300002585	I hope you're making your farewells, because we don't have much to say, otherwise.
FO300002586	What's more, some of the people are saying I should be the new Overseer. It's all so sudden.
FO300002587	What's more, some of the people are saying I should be the new Overseer. It's all so sudden.
FO300002588	I hope you're making progress with my father. I can't imagine anyone else who could convince him we should venture outside.
FO300002589	I hope you're making progress with the Overseer. I can't imagine anyone else who could convince him we should venture outside.
FO300002590	What is it?
FO300002591	Well, look at who came crawling back home?
FO300002592	What's the matter? Homesick? Outside not everything it was cracked up to be? Or was it just that Daddy didn't want you anymore?
FO300002593	Too bad. You're not wanted here. You're scum.
FO300002594	Can't you just leave me and my Vault to die in peace?
FO300002595	You know what? I changed my mind. Playtime's over, kid.
FO300002596	Aren't you supposed to be leaving?
FO300002597	Aren't you supposed to be leaving?
FO300002598	I just heard about your so-called "solution." I've got to admit, I didn't think you'd do it.
FO300002599	But, hey, you've solved my problems, and gave me an easy place to pin the blame. I guess I owe you my thanks.
FO300002600	I just heard about your so-called "solution." I should have you killed where you stand.
FO300002601	But obviously, we simply can't kill a Wasteland monster like you. The best we can do is offer you a sacrifice to send you on your way.
FO300002602	At least with you gone, our home can return to some semblance of peace, even if it came at a tragic cost.
FO300002603	I hear you talked some sense into that rabble, and convinced them to give up on their nonsense. All without bloodshed, no less.
FO300002604	Good thing, too. We can't afford to lose any more of the breeding pool. I guess I owe you something in the way of thanks.
FO300002605	I hear that you've had a little chat with our rebellious elements. It seems I underestimated your persuasive skills.
FO300002606	I applaud your restraint. Violence only weakens our community, and now is no time for weakness.
FO300002607	Once again, there is a firm hand in control, and all will be well in Vault 101. I suppose you'll want some sort of payment for your aid.
FO300002608	I told you to leave me here. This is my fate for failing the people of my Vault.
FO300002609	Now go! See if you can keep a few of them alive out there!
FO300002610	What do you want?
FO300002611	What do you want?
FO300002612	Ah, another patient! What's it to be, eh? Appendectomy? Tonsillectomy?
FO300002613	Hysterectomy?
FO300002614	Back again, hmm? Here to watch the master work?
FO300002615	Oh, it's good to see you're back from outside. It can be dangerous out there for someone your age.
FO300002616	It's been a while, kid. I guess the G.O.A.T. couldn't have predicted how you'd turn out, could it?
FO300002617	By the way, while I was in there, I heard some worrying things from the guards.
FO300002618	Well, if it isn't my star pupil.
FO300002619	You're back, again?
FO300002620	Can't you just leave us alone?
FO300002621	I don't know that I should be talking with you.
FO300002622	Oh boy, are you in trouble.
FO300002623	Oh, look. The bad seed is back.
FO300002624	You got a lot to answer for, kid.
FO300002625	I sure didn't expect you to show your face here again.
FO300002626	Don't you know enough to stay away?
FO300002627	Wow, you're back!
FO300002628	Hey, good to see you again!
FO300002629	You're alive!
FO300002630	<whimper>
FO300002631	<bark!>
FO300002632	Yeah?
FO300002633	Hey there.
FO300002634	Pretty impressive work for a civilian, bringing the Doctor here in once piece.
FO300002635	Sarah Lyons, Sentinel and commander of Lyons' Pride. Welcome to the Citadel.
FO300002636	You just manage to get yourself into all sorts of trouble, don't you?
FO300002637	Welcome to the Citadel. Not many civilians get to see the place.
FO300002638	What in the HELL do you think you're doing, mungo?
FO300002639	Hold it right there, mister!
FO300002640	Don't take another step, or we'll blow your fucking head off!
FO300002641	Hold it right there, lady!
FO300002642	Don't take another step, or we'll blow your fucking head off!
FO300002643	Unless you've got Sammy and the others with you, then get lost!
FO300002644	You again? I told you to get lost!
FO300002645	Hey, hey buddy! Hi. Yeah, so listen, thanks and all. Really great job you did there.
FO300002646	Boy this place is something else, isn't it? Really amazing stuff here.
FO300002647	Listen, thanks for getting us through that. I'm not stupid; I know we wouldn't have made it without you.
FO300002648	I'm sorry about your dad, and I'm sorry I've acted like an ass.
FO300002649	Hey, how's it going?
FO300002650	It's good to see you again. I hope that we can return to the purifier soon and finish your father's work.
FO300002651	In the meantime, it seems that my talents are of use to the Brotherhood. I still don't completely trust them, but I'm willing to look past that.
FO300002652	If you need something specific, please make it quick. Otherwise, excuse me. I have work to attend to.
FO300002653	<yawn> What?
FO300002654	Please excuse me. There is much work to be done.
FO300002655	Please excuse me. There is much work to be done.
FO300002656	Looks like it's all clear. Unlocking outer doors.
FO300002657	Door's open. Quit buzzing me, willya?
FO300002658	I'm not opening the door now! Are you crazy?!
FO300002659	Door stays closed until we finish securing the perimeter.
FO300002660	Keep your shirt on. I'm not opening the door until the commander gives the all clear.
FO300002661	Do you mind? We're a little busy at the moment!
FO300002662	You did it! You disarmed that thing!
FO300002663	Oh, and talk to Moira at Craterside Supply.  She can help you decorate the place.
FO300002664	My dad told me about how you're going to disarm the bomb. He gave me some stuff for you for when you get it done...
FO300002665	Not now!
FO300002666	I'll be damned! You did it, didn't you? You disarmed that thing!
FO300002667	Hell, where's my manners? I'm Lucas Simms, mayor and sheriff. And I'm pleased to say, we've had a reward for fixing up that bomb. Here you go!
FO300002668	Y'know, we could use someone like you living in town. We've got an empty place up behind the Brass Lantern. Here's the key and deed.
FO300002669	And heck, Moira over at Craterside Supply can even sell you stuff to help fix the place up.
FO300002670	Name's Lucas Simms, town sheriff. And mayor too, when the need arises.
FO300002671	You got a weird look about you, boy. The kind that means trouble. I give everyone a fair shake. But if you do anything remotely stupid, you're dead.
FO300002672	You got a weird look about you, boy. The kind that means trouble. I give everyone a fair shake. But if you do anything remotely stupid, you're dead.
FO300002673	You got a weird look about you, girl. The kind that means trouble. I give everyone a fair shake. But if you do anything remotely stupid, you're dead.
FO300002674	Name's Lucas Simms, town sheriff. And mayor too, when the need arises.
FO300002675	I don't know why, but I like you, boy! Something tells me you're all right. So welcome to Megaton! Just holler if you need something.
FO300002676	Name's Lucas Simms, town sheriff. And mayor too, when the need arises.
FO300002677	I don't know why, but I like you, girl! Something tells me you're all right. So welcome to Megaton! Just holler if you need something.
FO300002678	Name's Lucas Simms, town sheriff. And mayor too, when the need arises.
FO300002679	I must be getting slow in my old age. Thanks for saving my hide, there.
FO300002680	Haven't disarmed the bomb yet? That's some serious pre-war hardware. So go easy, okay?
FO300002681	Don't suppose you've disarmed that bomb?
FO300002682	I'll be damned! You did it, didn't you? You disarmed that thing!
FO300002683	Here's your reward. Hell, why don't you move in? Could use someone like you. Got an empty place here you can use. Here's the key and deed.
FO300002684	It ain't much to look at. But talk with Moira. She's got random odds and ends you might be able to spruce the place up with.
FO300002685	I'll be damned! You did it, didn't you? You disarmed that thing!
FO300002686	And all without asking for pay, too. Hell, why don't you move in? Here's the key and deed to an empty house. Consider yourself a Megaton citizen!
FO300002687	Oh and talk with Moira at Craterside Supply. She's got random odds and ends you might be able to spruce the place up with.
FO300002688	Not now!
FO300002689	Savor this moment.
FO300002690	Shush! You're ruining the moment.
FO300002691	Wait for my summons. I will send for you after I finish some business in the Wasteland.
FO300002692	Patience my love. I will send for you in due time.
FO300002693	Patience.
FO300002694	So. You're the genius who disarmed the bomb. Weeks of waiting and watching, ruined!
FO300002695	It's a pity you acted so hastily. In the future, best sleep with one eye open.
FO300002696	You will come to regret your actions.
FO300002697	My, my. Just when I had all but given up hope. My dear boy, I am very happy to make your acquaintance. I am Mister Burke.
FO300002698	And you, well, you are not a resident of this putrescent cesspool. That makes you a rather valuable individual.
FO300002699	My, my. Just when I had all but given up hope. My dear girl, I am very happy to make your acquaintance. I am Mister Burke.
FO300002700	And you, well, you are not a resident of this putrescent cesspool. That makes you a rather valuable individual.
FO300002701	You haven't rigged the bomb yet? If it's information you need, get to it. Time is wasting.
FO300002702	Back again, hmm? Perhaps you've reconsidered my offer?
FO300002703	The pulse charge is rigged? Excellent! Meet me upstairs at Tenpenny Tower. There you will see a most glorious sight.
FO300002704	Meet me upstairs at Tenpenny Tower.
FO300002705	The pulse charge is rigged? Excellent! Excellent!
FO300002706	Ah. The anticipation is palpable. Isn't it?
FO300002707	When you have finished savoring the moment, you may have the honor of pressing the button. Oh, and mind your eyes. It'll be brighter than bright.
FO300002708	The detonator is right over there. You may have the honor. Hit the switch!
FO300002709	I've been asked to extend to you an invitation to reside at Tenpenny Tower.
FO300002710	Here's the key, and deed, to your new master suite. It's on the top floor, first door on your right from the elevator. Enjoy your new accommodations.
FO300002711	Oh, and if you wish to spruce the place up a bit, speak with Lydia Montenegro in the Boutique le Chic.
FO300002712	I've been asked to extend to you an invitation to reside at Tenpenny Tower.
FO300002713	Here's the key, and deed, to your new master suite. It's on the top floor, first door on your right from the elevator. Enjoy your new accommodations.
FO300002714	Yeah, you're pretty busted up, but you'll live. Stop by the clinic in the morning.
FO300002715	Welcome to the Chop Shop. I'm Nurse Graves, Doctor Barrows' assistant.
FO300002716	Don't let our place's name fool you. The Doctor is very good with injuries, dismemberments, and trauma.
FO300002717	If you require any Stimpaks or Bloodpacks, let me know.
FO300002718	And how can we help you today?
FO300002719	Well, I guess you weren't such a jerk after all.
FO300002720	Wow, you look like you've been through Hell.
FO300002721	From what I've heard, sounds like you've been through Hell.
FO300002722	You look like you've been though Hell.
FO300002723	Well, I'm still waiting. What's the deal with my men?
FO300002724	Any other info I can give you?
FO300002725	Staying in Underworld isn't helping our cause. Make this fast.
FO300002726	You still here? The Rangers aren't going to last forever if you don't get out there and help them.
FO300002727	I thought we covered everything. What is it now?
FO300002728	Get the hell out of my face.
FO300002729	If you're going to continue to irritate me, I'm not going to be so nice about it.
FO300002730	How long have I been out?
FO300002731	Yeah? What is it? Ready to help?
FO300002732	Yeah? What do you want?
FO300002733	I'm afraid she's going to be out for a while. She's not well at all.
FO300002734	Don't worry though, I'm sure the rest of Reilly's Rangers will show up soon and take her home.
FO300002735	Doctor Barrows at your service. What brings you to the Chop Shop?
FO300002736	Come to lend me a hand I hope. I can always use fresh human samples.
FO300002737	Yes, what is it now? Please, be brief. I'm quite busy.
FO300002738	You sure know your shit. Ever consider joining the Rangers? I bet Reilly would love to have you on our team.
FO300002739	Remember, if you need anything fixed, look me up at the Ranger Compound.
FO300002740	Hey there. Donovan at your service. You break it, I fix it.
FO300002741	What can I do you for?
FO300002742	Hey man, the Butcher wants to see you. He's right over yonder.
FO300002743	Did ya see me? Nothing good ole' Eugene and a few hundred rounds of ammo couldn't handle.
FO300002744	Goodbye. If you're ever in the neighborhood and need some help, just listen for Eugene's rat-a-tat-tat. Ha ha ha!
FO300002745	Go go go!
FO300002746	Brick's the name, and I call this fine looking roomsweeper Eugene.
FO300002747	We've had a lot of fun together mowin' down Super Mutants, but I think it's time we get off this roof.
FO300002748	Yeah? What is it?
FO300002749	I think Butcher wants to talk with you and he's callin' the shots. We can talk about me 'n Eugene later.
FO300002750	Welcome back. It's great to see you again.
FO300002751	It's been good knowing you. Hope to see you at the Ranger Compound.
FO300002752	I'm going to head back to Ranger Compound and see if Reilly's back yet. If you make your way there, Reilly will pay you herself.
FO300002753	If I can ever be of medical assistance or you need some supplies or repairs, let me or Donovan know.
FO300002754	Again, I'm not sure how to thank you.
FO300002755	I'm going to head back to Ranger Compound to see if Reilly's back yet. Look me up anytime you're in the neighborhood.
FO300002756	If I can ever be of medical assistance or you need some supplies or repairs, let me or Donovan know.
FO300002757	We'll talk when we get to the exit. Let's roll.
FO300002758	Back so soon? Are we in luck?
FO300002759	Hey you! Get your ass over here before you attract every Super Mutant in the building!
FO300002760	The name's Butcher, I'm the team medic. It's good to see a friendly face.
FO300002761	Okay, now who the heck are you and when are reinforcements coming?
FO300002762	Welcome to Rivet City. Please wait while the bridge extends.
FO300002763	Welcome to Rivet City.
FO300002764	Hi. I'm Angela. My dad runs Gary's Galley. If you want anything to eat, talk to him.
FO300002765	Hi. I'm Angela. I run Gary's Galley. Let me know when you are ready to order.
FO300002766	Have you heard? I'm getting married!
FO300002767	Welcome to Gary's Galley. Can I take your order?
FO300002768	Yes, sir?
FO300002769	Yes, ma'am?
FO300002770	Lay a hand on Doctor Zimmer, and I'll snap your neck like a chicken bone.
FO300002771	That's close enough. Keep your hands where I can see them.
FO300002772	The market is closing soon. You'd better make it quick.
FO300002773	The council has a report that C.J. Young is missing. Have you seen her?
FO300002774	Welcome to Potomac Attire. I am Bannon, proprietor and City Council member.
FO300002775	I carry discriminating attire for discriminating customers.
FO300002776	We haven't met. I'm Bannon, proprietor of Potomac Attire, and City Council member.
FO300002777	You should stop by my shop. What you're wearing is dreadful.
FO300002778	I heard that Danvers found a letter from Slavers in Seagrave's room.
FO300002779	That will teach that bastard to mess with me.
FO300002780	I think you've earned a permanent discount here.
FO300002781	You told Danvers that I was trying to blackmail Seagrave.
FO300002782	Thanks to you, they've suspended council meeting and are probably going to censure me.
FO300002783	I can't ban you from my shop, but they can't tell me what to charge.
FO300002784	Welcome to Potomac Attire.
FO300002785	I think I've seen you in here before. When you're ready to buy, just let me know.
FO300002786	Have you found anything you like?
FO300002787	Is this interruption really necessary?
FO300002788	I'm Belle Bonny, and this is the Muddy Rudder.
FO300002789	I'll tell you what I tell all the fresh meat. Don't start anything down here or I'll have Brock kick your ass.

FO300002792	You're a new one. I'm Belle Bonny of the Muddy Rudder. Make it quick.
FO300002793	What the hell do you want?
FO300002794	I'm Brock, the bouncer. I take care of the troublemakers. You aren't going to be a troublemaker, are you?
FO300002795	Don't tell me your problems.
FO300002796	I can't talk right now. My daughter, C.J. is missing.
FO300002797	If you see her, please send her home right away.
FO300002798	This place won't clean itself. That's my job.
FO300002799	Look, I'm busy.
FO300002800	This is A Quick Fix. I mean that's the name of our shop. Paulie and mine that is. My name is Cindy. Cindy Cantelli.

FO300002803	Made up your mind yet?
FO300002804	I'm Cindy. I mean, Cindy Cantelli. I'm a quick fix. I mean, I run A Quick Fix. Anyway, you were saying?
FO300002805	Oh! It's you. I mean, hi there.
FO300002806	Will you take me home, mister? I'm scared.
FO300002807	Will you take me home, ma'am? I'm scared.
FO300002808	I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
FO300002809	Yes, miss.
FO300002810	Maybe you don't know who you're talking to. I'm Commander Danvers, assistant chief of security.
FO300002811	Maybe you don't know who you're talking to. I'm Chief Danvers, head of Rivet City security.
FO300002812	This better be good.
FO300002813	Ted Strayer. You can chill with me if you want, dude.
FO300002814	Whoa! What's the rush, dude?
FO300002815	I'm Diego, the acolyte for Saint Monica's.
FO300002816	I'm Diego,the new priest for Saint Monica's.
FO300002817	Have you seen Angela? I need to ask her something about our wedding.
FO300002818	God bless you and keep you safe.
FO300002819	Hmmm? Oh! Do you need something?
FO300002820	You're in the Rivet City Clinic. I'm Doctor Preston.
FO300002821	I'm eating right now. If you're hurt, I'll be back in the clinic shortly.
FO300002822	You're wounded. Let me bandage that.
FO300002823	You don't look hurt. What can I do for you?
FO300002824	I am Father Clifford. This is Saint Monica's church.
FO300002825	I am Father Clifford of Saint Monica's church.
FO300002826	Can this wait? I'm very busy planning a wedding.
FO300002827	May Saint Monica bless you.
FO300002828	It's almost closing time. I'd get out of here if I was you.
FO300002829	This here is Flak and Shrapnel's gun shop. Pretty catchy, huh? Take a look around. If you see anything you like, I'll be right over here.
FO300002830	Decided to check out the shop, eh? If you want any of this shit, just holler.
FO300002831	Made up your mind?
FO300002832	I'm Flak. If you want something better than that peashooter, stop by Flak and Shrapnel's.
FO300002833	I'm Flak. If you want something better than that stick of yours, stop by Flak and Shrapnel's.
FO300002834	I'm Flak. If you want a decent weapon, stop by Flak and Shrapnel's.

FO300002836	Let me introduce myself. I am Gary Staley gourmet chef and gourmand. I'll be preparing your meal.
FO300002837	My specialty is Mirelurk Cakes. Although the iguana is very popular too.
FO300002838	I'm Gary. Gary Staley. If you ever get hungry, stop by Gary's Galley.
FO300002839	Ah! I knew you wouldn't be able to stay away from my cuisine for long.
FO300002840	How may I serve you?
FO300002841	Make it quick. I'm on a tight schedule.
FO300002842	Is there a problem?
FO300002843	This isn't a good time. My daugher, C.J. is missing.
FO300002844	If you hear anything, please let me know right away.
FO300002845	This place could use a few more people willing to work. Everything is falling apart and I'm the only one willing to fix it.
FO300002846	I'm busy. I've got a lot of repairs to make.
FO300002847	What do you want?
FO300002848	I'm scared. Will you take me home? Take me to my Mom.
FO300002849	I'm scared. Will you take me home?
FO300002850	What's your problem, mister?
FO300002851	What's your problem, lady?
FO300002852	I'm Janice Kaplinski, chief botanist. What do you need?
FO300002853	Be careful around these fruits and vegetables. They're worth more to us than you are.
FO300002854	You need me? For what?
FO300002855	Well? Are you going to help me or turn me over to the Slaver?
FO300002856	Stay away from me. What do you want? Are you one of them?
FO300002857	Stay away from me!
FO300002858	I heard Sister is dead. Thank God!
FO300002859	I'd rather be alone just now.
FO300002860	Welcome to the Weatherly. Mister Buckingham at your service.
FO300002861	How may I serve you?
FO300002862	Haven't run into you before. You probably wouldn't remember me anyway. I'm Mister Lopez.
FO300002863	I wish I had the courage to end it all.
FO300002864	I'm just taking things one day at a time.
FO300002865	Just leave me alone.
FO300002866	Haven't seen you in here before. Do you need a fix? I might have what you need. You can always come see Paulie to get what you need.
FO300002867	Who are you? Got any Psycho? I could really use a fix, but I'm broke.
FO300002868	Ha ha! I run the chem shop, but I'm broke and can't buy chems!
FO300002869	Looking for a fix?
FO300002870	Make it quick, will ya? I'm coming down and I gotta get my fix.
FO300002871	How the hell did you get in here? Hmph. I suppose you can't be all that bad if you made it this far without dying.
FO300002872	Stay sharp. They're everywhere.
FO300002873	Sir, yes sir! Private Jones reporting!
FO300002874	Sir, yes sir!
FO300002875	You'd better get out of here. The guards are going to close up soon.
FO300002876	Howdy. I'm Seagrave. Seagrave Holmes. I have a little of just about everything here.
FO300002877	You must be new. I'm Seagrave. If you've got anything you want to unload, stop by my shop, Rivet City Supply.
FO300002878	Hey! I heard that Bannon got caught trying to frame me.
FO300002879	I also heard you ratted him out. I think you've earned a true, blue friendship discount.
FO300002880	You sneak into my room, steal my property, and then tell the world about it.
FO300002881	I'd ban you from my shop if they'd let me. Instead I'll just have to settle for ripping you off.
FO300002882	Take a look around. I got all kinds of stuff in here.
FO300002883	The shop's closed right now. Is there anything else I can do for you?
FO300002884	Can't you see I'm eating? What do you want?
FO300002885	Hey, you. Have you seen C.J. Young? We have a report that she is missing.
FO300002886	I'm on duty. Make it quick.
FO300002887	We're going to close soon. You'd better get out of here.
FO300002888	They call me Shrapnel. I run this place. Got the best damn armament you'll ever see.
FO300002889	Don't know you, don't care. Keep it short.
FO300002890	If you want any of this shit, just say so. Otherwise keep your fingers the hell away from the triggers. I don't want no accidents.
FO300002891	What's your beef?
FO300002892	They call me Sister. Don't ask.
FO300002893	You're bothering me. You don't want to bother me.
FO300002894	I'm Tammy. Have you seen my good for nothing son lately?
FO300002895	The little shit is usually up to no good.
FO300002896	I'm Tammy. Just leave me alone, okay.
FO300002897	Yeah? What do you want?
FO300002898	Hey, good lookin'. How come you haven't bought me a drink yet?
FO300002899	Shit. Just what this hole needs. Another woman.
FO300002900	Either buy me a drink, or take your skanky ass somewhere else.
FO300002901	Buy a girl a drink, sailor?
FO300002902	Unless you're going to buy me a round, get lost.
FO300002903	Welcome to the Weatherly Hotel. I am your hostess, Vera Weatherly.
FO300002904	Charmed to meet you. I am Vera Weatherly of the Weatherly Hotel.

FO300002909	Are you in need of assistance?
FO300002910	Those Raiders strapped me with explosives! You've got to help me!
FO300002911	Got to get away! They're burning everything!
FO300002912	Yeah? What is it?
FO300002913	Who the hell are you?! Where did you come from?! Did Moriarty send you?!
FO300002914	It's the best we could do. Please take it, with our thanks.
FO300002915	I wish there were more people like you in the world.
FO300002916	I want you to have this. I hope it helps keep you safe.
FO300002917	Our abolitionist hero!
FO300002918	Life is much better for us here than it was in the Wasteland. We're better armed and better fed.
FO300002919	I am most honored to see you again, sir.
FO300002920	I am most honored to see you again, ma'am.
FO300002921	You've come to see us! How sweet.
FO300002922	Thanks to you, we're rebuilding the Memorial.
FO300002923	It's great to see you again.
FO300002924	The slaves know their place now, thanks to you.
FO300002925	I'm not looking for trouble, or conversation either.
FO300002926	All better now, you big baby. Can I get back to work now?
FO300002927	Alright, that should do it. You need anything else?
FO300002928	All better now, you big baby. Can I get back to work now?
FO300002929	Okay, you should be fine, and ready to run off and play.
FO300002930	I'll say this; it's easier to work on a mungo, since you're a lot bigger. Easier to find a vein, at least.
FO300002931	Good as new. Now, watch yourself out there, all right?
FO300002932	Now next time, try to be where the bullets aren't.
FO300002933	There you go. All better, you big baby. You need anything else?
FO300002934	That should keep you going for a bit longer.
FO300002935	Medical procedure complete. Further instructions?
FO300002936	RL-3 is ready for another tour of duty, sir!
FO300002937	I am disappointed that things have come to this.
FO300002938	It is well to see you again. Shall we continue?
FO300002939	Yes? What do you require?
FO300002940	Vigilance is necessary in this location. Be on your guard, my friend.
FO300002941	There is a foul stench on the wind. Let us not tarry for long.
FO300002942	And so you return. It is good to see you hale. How my I help you, my friend?
FO300002943	I had a feeling you would return. Is it further assistance that you seek?
FO300002944	What do you need?
FO300002945	PLAYER SWING MELEE WEAPON
FO300002946	Can I try that? Just for a minute? Please?
FO300002947	I used to have one just like that.
FO300002948	Neat. What else you got?
FO300002949	Watch where you're swinging that, will you?
FO300002950	Is that really necessary?
FO300002951	Hey, knock it off.
FO300002952	Why don't you go swing that somewhere else?
FO300002953	Careful with that.
FO300002954	Stop doing that so close to me.
FO300002955	Would you stop screwing around?

FO300002965	PLAYER FIRE WEAPON
FO300002966	Whoa, whoa! Careful!
FO300002967	Hey, knock it off!
FO300002968	Watch it!

FO300002972	What are you doing? That's dangerous!
FO300002973	Stop that! Someone could get hurt.
FO300002974	PLAYER LAY MINE
FO300002975	You know what you're doing there?
FO300002976	Whoa now. Be careful with that thing.
FO300002977	Don't blow yourself up, okay?
FO300002978	You sure that's a good idea?
FO300002979	I hope you know what you're doing.
FO300002980	Be careful with that.
FO300002981	I trust you know what you're doing.
FO300002982	PLAYER Z KEY OBJECT
FO300002983	Oh come on. Cut it out.
FO300002984	Put that down, will you?
FO300002985	Give it a rest, will you?
FO300002986	Is that really necessary?
FO300002987	Are you having fun with that?
FO300002988	You're easily amused, eh?
FO300002989	What are you going to do with that?
FO300002990	Does that belong to you?
FO300002991	You're kind of weird.
FO300002992	Do you know where that's been?
FO300002993	Is that really necessary?
FO300002994	PLAYER JUMP
FO300002995	Hey, there's no jumping in the capitol.

FO300003006	Watch where you're going.
FO300003007	PLAYER IN IRON SITES
FO300003008	Put that away. Unless you plan on using it.
FO300003009	I've had guns leveled at me before. If you are wise, you will pause to consider that I am still around to talk about it.
FO300003010	Only small men require guns to do their persuading.
FO300003011	Most civilized people consider waving guns around to be rather uncouth.
FO300003012	Why don't you put that away? Or do I need to give you a lesson in manners?
FO300003013	Don't point that thing at me.
FO300003014	Hey, knock it off.
FO300003015	What do you think you're doing?

FO300003021	Now's not really the time for that, is it?
FO300003022	PLAYER DESTROY OBJECT
FO300003023	Was that really necessary?
FO300003024	I certainly didn't raise you to behave like that.
FO300003025	That was uncalled for.
FO300003026	Be more careful, will you?
FO300003027	HELLO

FO300003048	What do you want?

FO300003053	Nice to see you again.
FO300003054	What's going on out there?
FO300003055	Huh? How'd you get in here?
FO300003056	What is it now?
FO300003057	What's going on out there?
FO300003058	Ha ha! We're outta that shitbox!
FO300003059	We're free!
FO300003060	Hey hey, mungo! We're getting' outta here, right?
FO300003061	Hey there.
FO300003062	Yes?
FO300003063	Welcome to Tenpenny Tower.
FO300003064	Ah, hello!
FO300003065	What are you doing here?
FO300003066	You are welcome here any time.
FO300003067	Hey there. Come to use the radio set?
FO300003068	Always a pleasure when you visit.
FO300003069	Welcome back!
FO300003070	Good to see you.
FO300003071	Hey.
FO300003072	Hello.
FO300003073	Begone from this place, blasphemer!
FO300003074	Oasis is no longer a refuge for you, Outsider.
FO300003075	You stupid-head! I can't believe you mouthed off to the Tree Father.
FO300003076	You're no longer welcome here.
FO300003077	Leave us and never look back, Outsider.
FO300003078	Such a shame, you could have been of great benefit to us.
FO300003079	It's time for you to leave.
FO300003080	How can I help you, Outsider?
FO300003081	Tsk. To think you could have been rich. And now all you'll be is sorry.  VERY sorry.
FO300003082	I would advise staying clear of me for awhile. A LONG while.
FO300003083	Tell me. Do you have a death wish?
FO300003084	Hey, what'd I tell you about lookin' at me like that? Are you in the mood for a busted mouth or something?
FO300003085	You'd best point those peepers somewhere else before I tear 'em out of your skull.
FO300003086	Did you hear about those newbies? The ones who who went up north lookin' for raids?
FO300003087	Oh, hey. Check this out. You know those rookie idiots that tried to head up north?
FO300003088	Come on in and relax with a cold Nuka-Cola.
FO300003089	You have the violin! You've done it!
FO300003090	Oh my word! Is that what I think it is?
FO300003091	Hello, my Child.
FO300003092	Hello, my Child.
FO300003093	Father and son, side by side. This is the way it should be.
FO300003094	My God, can you believe the devastation out here? That's why our work is so important.
FO300003095	I'm glad I've got you watching my back. I'm not quite sure I'm cut out for all this excitement. Not anymore.
FO300003096	Come on, let's keep moving.
FO300003097	Not much farther. We'll be at Rivet City before you know it.
FO300003098	Let me guess. The dog's coming with us, yes?
FO300003099	Ahzrukhal, boy, I want to talk to you.
FO300003100	Well hello there, sweeheart.
FO300003101	Hello there, Junior.
FO300003102	Hello there, Junior, sweetheart. It's a lovely day, isn't it?
FO300003103	Hey there, Junior!
FO300003104	How's it going, sport?
FO300003105	Hey there, little buddy!
FO300003106	There's my honey pie!
FO300003107	Honeypie, can I talk to you?
FO300003108	Hi, Mrs. Smith!
FO300003109	Dinner smells great, mom!
FO300003110	Room's all clean, mom!
FO300003111	You got the stuff, I got the caps. A match made in heaven.
FO300003112	All my equipment is ready. Just need some Sugar Bombs.
FO300003113	Whoa, who the hell are you?
FO300003114	So what's the deal, smoothskin?
FO300003115	Goddamn are you one ugly son-of-a-bitch!
FO300003116	Keep it moving, meat.
FO300003117	Yeah? You got somethin' to say?
FO300003118	No one messes with Sudden-Death Overtime. No one.
FO300003119	Damn, poor Mercier. He was a good Winger.
FO300003120	Well if it isn't our "hero."
FO300003121	Hey kid.
FO300003122	Hey. Thanks again. Couldn't have done it with out ya.
FO300003123	Trading caps for crap, step right up!
FO300003124	Got some junk to unload? I'm buying!
FO300003125	Welcome, friend. Looking for more appropriate attire?
FO300003126	The spirits told me you'd be coming. And that you're looking to buy.
FO300003127	Here for a pick-me-up?
FO300003128	If you've got the caps, I've got your fix.
FO300003129	Here to pick up a few of my marvelous toys?
FO300003130	Fear not, for Lucky Harith is here to offer you protection for a price!
FO300003131	Looking to make a trade?
FO300003132	Searching for that special something?
FO300003133	Excuse me.
FO300003134	Don't you have a component to deliver?
FO300003135	Hey, Andy. Got a sec?
FO300003136	Andy, listen to this great idea I had!
FO300003137	Hey there, Andy.
FO300003138	Billy, can I talk to you about something?
FO300003139	Mister Moriarty? Can I talk to you?
FO300003140	Hey, Colin.
FO300003141	Colin.
FO300003142	Husband, a word if you will.
FO300003143	Might we talk, dearest husband?
FO300003144	Confessor.
FO300003145	Hey, Jenny. Lookin' good. What've you got for me today?
FO300003146	Well, hello there, sweetie. What's on the menu today?
FO300003147	Hi, Jenny.
FO300003148	Hey, Jenny.
FO300003149	What's up, Jericho?
FO300003150	Hey, Jericho.
FO300003151	Gob. These people aren't nearly drunk enough. Fix it.
FO300003152	Gob!
FO300003153	I want a word with you, zombie.
FO300003154	Hey. Zombie. Yeah, you. Come here.
FO300003155	Gob. Here. Now.
FO300003156	Come here for a second, son. I want to talk to you.
FO300003157	Harden, come here, boy. I want to talk to you.
FO300003158	It's my turn to be the Raiders!
FO300003159	I see you, Harden!
FO300003160	C'mon, Harden! Let's go over here!
FO300003161	Hey there, Harden.
FO300003162	Leo, we need to talk.
FO300003163	Hey, Leo. Come here. I want to talk to you about something.
FO300003164	Dad! Dad, I want to talk to you!
FO300003165	Nothing stops the Railroad.
FO300003166	Hi there!
FO300003167	You MUST be lost...
FO300003168	All are welcome here at the Ninth Circle...
FO300003169	Welcome to the Capital Preservation Society!
FO300003170	It's so very nice to see you again.
FO300003171	Good to have you back.
FO300003172	If you have any questions about the exhibits, please let me know.
FO300003173	Do have a look around, but don't touch anything.
FO300003174	We have the most complete archive of U.S. historical documents in the Wasteland.
FO300003175	Get the hell away from me.
FO300003176	Keep it moving. I got a whole bottle of whiskey with my name on it.
FO300003177	The sooner we get back, the sooner we get paid.
FO300003178	Let's get this scrap of paper to Abraham.
FO300003179	The Declaration is in the safe, I just know it.
FO300003180	That robot's brain is scrambled.
FO300003181	What a nutjob.
FO300003182	This place is pretty far down, no wonder there's so little damage.
FO300003183	This place isn't right. Robots still active?
FO300003184	We're getting closer, I can feel it.
FO300003185	I know this place like the back of my hand.
FO300003186	So far, so good.
FO300003187	Let's keep moving.
FO300003188	Come on, let me loose!
FO300003189	Time to go yet?
FO300003190	Nothing new, sir.
FO300003191	Sir, people are mostly staying quiet.
FO300003192	Security check, people. Everything all right?
FO300003193	Everyone sticking to curfew down here? Good.
FO300003194	Everything all right down here?
FO300003195	Standard check-in. Things okay?
FO300003196	All quiet down here, right?
FO300003197	Overseer's glad to see everyone staying so calm down here.
FO300003198	For your safety, please stand clear.
FO300003199	Back to the drawing board.
FO300003200	Sigh. Time to start back at square one.
FO300003201	You wish to add something to my hypothesis?
FO300003202	I suppose I could answer a few more queries.
FO300003203	How else may I assist you in your endeavors?
FO300003204	Oh my!
FO300003205	Where did I go wrong? I must run more tests.
FO300003206	Shhhh, quiet please. Science is in progress!
FO300003207	Holy moley! You actually came back like you said you would! Did you find me a home?
FO300003208	The ants! They're all dead! Every single one of 'em!
FO300003209	Wow! Are you the one that made all these ants do that?!
FO300003210	I'm glad you came back, mister.
FO300003211	I'm glad you came back, lady.
FO300003212	I hope you have good news for me, I really do!
FO300003213	Hey! You're back! Any word? Any news?!
FO300003214	Oh, you decided to come back, huh?
FO300003215	Yeah, whatcha' need mister?
FO300003216	Yeah, whatcha' need lady?
FO300003217	Leave us alone!
FO300003218	Get out!
FO300003219	Don't do this. Please tell me the code.
FO300003220	Keep moving!
FO300003221	Get inside!
FO300003222	Head for the Control Room.
FO300003223	What did you do?
FO300003224	Shouldn't you be leaving now?
FO300003225	Well done, well done!
FO300003226	The Pint-Sized Slasher returns!
FO300003227	Oh, Mabel. Always good for a laugh.
FO300003228	Poor Janet and Roger.
FO300003229	You won the game!
FO300003230	Have you gone to see Timmy yet?
FO300003231	Good, you made it.
FO300003232	Glad to see you here.
FO300003233	Hey, look. Another rebel.
FO300003234	Good to see another rebel.
FO300003235	Hey, how's the gang holding up?
FO300003236	Still representing the gang? Good to see, man.
FO300003237	Is the place secure? Can we talk freely?
FO300003238	Good to see you here. Please keep quiet, you never know who's listening.
FO300003239	Hi, Christine. How's life stuck in the freak dorm?
FO300003240	Hi, Chrissie. Any stories from the weirdo dorm?
FO300003241	Hi, Susie!
FO300003242	Good to see you, Susie!
FO300003243	Stanley, how's everything going downstairs?
FO300003244	Well, Stanley, how's everything going down in the reactor?
FO300003245	Good to see ya, Butch.
FO300003246	Tunnel Snakes rule, huh?
FO300003247	Man, I sure wish we could blow this joint.
FO300003248	Please, be careful.
FO300003249	You've got to change the Overseer's mind.
FO300003250	You've got to convince them it isn't safe outside!
FO300003251	Are you sure you won't stay and help?
FO300003252	Go on, get out.
FO300003253	I'm sorry. Goodbye.
FO300003254	Sorry to see you go.
FO300003255	You did it!
FO300003256	What have you done?
FO300003257	I never thought you'd be back.
FO300003258	It's good to see you again.
FO300003259	Leave me alone.
FO300003260	Why won't you just leave us alone? You've done enough damage.
FO300003261	Go ahead and start something, I dare you.
FO300003262	You don't belong here anymore.
FO300003263	Who do we have here?
FO300003264	Excellent.
FO300003265	You're not going to ask me to hold your hand through this are you?
FO300003266	Yes? Are you having trouble with your little assignment? Do I need to find someone else?
FO300003267	Yes?
FO300003268	We're all still breathing. So I know you didn't screw up. You got something on your mind?
FO300003269	Were you just kidding 'bout disarming that thing?
FO300003270	You looking for the mayor or the sheriff?
FO300003271	It was a wonderful thing you did. Inspirational. Truly.
FO300003272	Yes friend? Is there something I can assist you with?
FO300003273	Thanks again for you part in paving the way towards progress.
FO300003274	Boy do I breathe a lot easier knowing that thing is truly dead!
FO300003275	Mighty fine thing you did for this town.
FO300003276	Hey friend!
FO300003277	Well? Is it done yet? Did you get that door open?
FO300003278	What are you waiting for? Go open that emergency door!
FO300003279	What?! You're not here with good news, are you?
FO300003280	What's up with those bigots at the tower?
FO300003281	Yeah! We did it!
FO300003282	Hahaha! They'll get it now!
FO300003283	I can smell the stink of Ghoul on you.
FO300003284	Well? What's the status on Roy Phillips and his gang?
FO300003285	Not ready to take on those Ghouls after all? Huh?
FO300003286	How'd you get in here?!
FO300003287	We should get out of here, don't you think?
FO300003288	You can't leave me here!
FO300003289	Alright! Hi there!
FO300003290	Remember my offer, Outsider: cash for pre-war books.
FO300003291	If you have any pre-war books, I'll take them.
FO300003292	You are not welcome here.
FO300003293	Do you have any scrap metal for me?
FO300003294	Remember: cash for scrap metal.
FO300003295	Casdin said you're clear.
FO300003296	Stay in line, and you'll be okay.
FO300003297	Don't start anything and you'll be fine. Um, probably.
FO300003298	Keep that tech coming, and we'll make it worth your while.
FO300003299	You are in the presence of ant royalty!
FO300003300	Yes, citizen?
FO300003301	Whatever you can do to help our town, we'd appreciate it.
FO300003302	We appreciate you taking care of our town's little problem.
FO300003303	Any luck finding those two troublemakers, yet?
FO300003304	When you find those two costumed idiots, put a bullet in their heads for me.
FO300003305	Nice work cleaning up the town.
FO300003306	Town's a lot safer now. Thanks.
FO300003307	Aw, you made this place get so boring.
FO300003308	Run while you can!
FO300003309	You're back! Oh my gosh!
FO300003310	Don't you have a letter to deliver?
FO300003311	Hey there, glad you're back.
FO300003312	A traveler, eh?
FO300003313	Ah, you've returned.
FO300003314	It appears we have a lot to speak about.
FO300003315	Welcome to Meresti, human.
FO300003316	You wish to speak with me?
FO300003317	I take it you found the place.
FO300003318	I hope you killed every last one of those bastards.
FO300003319	You're back already? What do you have for me?
FO300003320	Please tell me you've found something.
FO300003321	I hope you got some good news tucked away for me.
FO300003322	Well, is everyone okay?
FO300003323	Yeah?
FO300003324	I've never seen you around here before.
FO300003325	Please don't take Ian away from us.
FO300003326	Human or not, I don't care. You got caps, I got stuff.
FO300003327	Anything you need, I got it.
FO300003328	I'll be at my store later. Catch me there in the Common Area.
FO300003329	You new here too?
FO300003330	Oh, hey there.
FO300003331	You got the cash, I got the time.
FO300003332	Howdy, handsome.
FO300003333	Howdy, cutie.
FO300003334	Hello there, stranger.
FO300003335	Hello again.
FO300003336	Oh, it's you again. What's up?
FO300003337	What the hell are you doing in here?
FO300003338	Wasn't I clear the last time you were here?
FO300003339	Welcome back to Arefu, kid.
FO300003340	Huh? Oh, you're back.
FO300003341	Hey ho! Welcome back to our cozy village!
FO300003342	Hey, you're back! Let's chat a while.
FO300003343	Huh? Almost didn't see you there.
FO300003344	What the fuck do you want?
FO300003345	What brings you back to Megaton?
FO300003346	I knew you couldn't stay away!
FO300003347	The Family welcomes your return with open arms.
FO300003348	Thanks again for straightening out Ian.
FO300003349	Well, well look who's back.
FO300003350	Look what the cat dragged in.
FO300003351	Needed a place to get out of the sun for a while, eh? I understand completely.
FO300003352	Come back to the "scary vampire lair" have we? He he he!
FO300003353	I was wondering if we could speak a moment.
FO300003354	What's up?
FO300003355	You look quite troubled, my darling. What's on your mind?
FO300003356	And how are we doing today?
FO300003357	Hey there, how's it going?
FO300003358	How's life treating ya?
FO300003359	Can we go now?
FO300003360	I'm still here. Waiting for you.
FO300003361	I'm bored!
FO300003362	Are we actually gonna do something, or am I gonna stand here all day?
FO300003363	I patiently await your word.
FO300003364	RL-3 stands at attention, sir!
FO300003365	I am vigilant.
FO300003366	Oh, another soul to add to my circle of darkness.
FO300003367	Looks like the muties missed one.
FO300003368	Oh, great, another person trying to kill us all off.
FO300003369	Someone new in town? You aren't from Lamplight.
FO300003370	Welcome to my clinic. If you're hurt, then you're in the right place.
FO300003371	Hey there. Are you hurt?
FO300003372	The Wastelander from Germantown. How's life treating you?
FO300003373	Here to help me out again?
FO300003374	Hey, look at me. I'm in Big Town!
FO300003375	You saved my life. Thank you.
FO300003376	I've got nothing to say until Hannibal says you're okay.
FO300003377	I hope you succeed, stranger. I can't wait to set up a school for freed slaves.
FO300003378	Careful where you point that thing. Can't we talk about this?
FO300003379	Hey you. Ya, you. I want to talk to you.
FO300003380	Changed your mind?
FO300003381	Well, look who's back.
FO300003382	So dude, did that key ever get you anything?
FO300003383	Ah! It's the keeper of the key.
FO300003384	Hey, clown shoes. I hope that key was worth it.
FO300003385	Too bad about Crowley. I heard Tenpenny put out a contract on him.
FO300003386	Is something amiss?
FO300003387	We'll begin as soon as the rest of the Treeminders have taken their places.
FO300003388	Yes, Outsider?
FO300003389	I can't believe you're here!
FO300003390	All will be answered soon, my friend.
FO300003391	I hate you! I hate you!
FO300003392	It's good to see you again, Outsider.
FO300003393	We welcome you always with outstretched arms.
FO300003394	Hello again, Outsider.
FO300003395	Oasis is no more.
FO300003396	The Great One is dead!
FO300003397	We are lost!
FO300003398	Tree Father and Leaf Mother have conferred with the Great One. Something important must have happened.
FO300003399	Our leaders have spoken with the Great One. I hope nothing's wrong.
FO300003400	Something here is different. I can feel it.
FO300003401	I feel a change in the air. I wonder what it could be.
FO300003402	You're a guest among us and quite welcome, Outsider.
FO300003403	Cast aside your bits of technology and marvel at His miracles, Outsider.
FO300003404	Revel, Outsider. You are under His protection.
FO300003405	There's nowhere like this left in the world anymore, eh Outsider?
FO300003406	This place is wonderful, isn't it?

FO300003415	Slaver business only, remember? Now get out of here before I decide to use you for target practice.
FO300003416	Where do you think you're going?
FO300003417	You trying to get yourself shot or something?
FO300003418	Got a minute?
FO300003419	Looks like something's on your mind, Lucy.
FO300003420	What's bothering you, Penny?
FO300003421	Care to talk?
FO300003422	Hey, Zip. Come over here.
FO300003423	Here for your grub?
FO300003424	Chow time?
FO300003425	Hey, you.
FO300003426	Excuse me, I've got a question.
FO300003427	Um, can I ask something?
FO300003428	Excuse me.
FO300003429	Why, hello little girl. What a lovely dress you have!
FO300003430	Just bring me a nice kid to meet, and I'll take care of the rest.
FO300003431	Hey, dummy.
FO300003432	Hey, Sammy.
FO300003433	Hey, squirt.
FO300003434	Hey, heard the latest tales of the Wastes?
FO300003435	So, bro, any luck trading today?
FO300003436	So, sis, crack anybody up today?
FO300003437	Hey, sis!
FO300003438	Hey, sib!
FO300003439	Wanna hear a story?
FO300003440	What's up?
FO300003441	So, sis, made any good jokes today?
FO300003442	Guess what?
FO300003443	Mind if I follow you around for a bit? I promise not to bug you! It'll be fun!
FO300003444	Oh, hey, excuse me, hey!
FO300003445	Somebody said you wanted to see me, E?
FO300003446	Can you tell me more about growing up, big brother?
FO300003447	Joseph, what happens when a person grows up?
FO300003448	Pardon me.
FO300003449	I wanna know more about shooting.
FO300003450	Tell me more about shooting, Joseph.
FO300003451	Excuse me.
FO300003452	Look alive, you mopey motherfucker, you've got a mayor talking to you!
FO300003453	Hey, Princess, give the squirt a fucking break and answer a few questions.
FO300003454	Hey, Princess, if you aren't busy daydreaming about me, how about answering a few questions?
FO300003455	Eclair, stop trying to make crap taste like sugar and tell me what's going on.
FO300003456	Anybody break anything important, Lucy?
FO300003457	Knock, what's up? And if you say "the sky" I swear I'm gonna kick you in the junk.
FO300003458	Knick, anything new and fancy in your magic junkpile full of crap?
FO300003459	Joe, anything useful you can teach me about how the classes are going?
FO300003460	Well, if it isn't my favorite girl.
FO300003461	Look alive!
FO300003462	Hewwo!
FO300003463	Lucy, can you take a look at this?
FO300003464	Hey.
FO300003465	Watch it.
FO300003466	You have my vote, Mister President.
FO300003467	Got a second?
FO300003468	Hey, let me ask you something.
FO300003469	Father, might I have a word with you?
FO300003470	I need to speak with you, Father.
FO300003471	Please. Help me.
FO300003472	<mumbles to himself>
FO300003473	<hiccups>
FO300003474	Is someone there?
FO300003475	<sniffs>You smell llike the Wasteland.
FO300003476	Oh, look, a new toy!
FO300003477	What do you want?
FO300003478	Mr. Eulogy. He's lookin' at me again.
FO300003479	Mr. Eulogy. She's lookin' at me again.
FO300003480	You want somthin'?
FO300003481	You like what you see? Talk to Mr. Eulogy.
FO300003482	Don't mind Eulogy. Daddy don't pay no attention to us.
FO300003483	Hey there, handsome.
FO300003484	I'm sure you have a great personality.
FO300003485	Hey there, pretty.
FO300003486	Can't help you now. Come to the clinic in the morning.
FO300003487	Sorry, kid. Clinic's closed.
FO300003488	What do you want?
FO300003489	You hurt?
FO300003490	You here to do business?
FO300003491	It's a pleasure to see a fresh face around here.
FO300003492	Welcome to Paradise Falls, my dear.
FO300003493	Here on business?
FO300003494	Welcome to Paradise Falls, sir. Step right on up.
FO300003495	Anything I can help you with?
FO300003496	I've killed people for looking at me like that.
FO300003497	WHAT?
FO300003498	<belches>
FO300003499	<disgusting hacking cough>
FO300003500	Enjoy your stay. Hahaha!
FO300003501	What are you hangin' around here for?
FO300003502	Head on up.
FO300003503	Watch yourself up there.
FO300003504	<grunts>
FO300003505	<grunts>
FO300003506	<grunts>
FO300003507	Please, won't you help?
FO300003508	I'm off right now. Hit me up in the morning.
FO300003509	Sorry, man. Shop's closed.
FO300003510	I got all kinds of guns, man.
FO300003511	You looking to buy something?
FO300003512	Holy, shit! Where'd you get that gun?
FO300003513	You need a new shooter, bro?
FO300003514	You need a new shooter, chica?
FO300003515	Ain't no reason to stick around here, is there?
FO300003516	Tell Eulogy I said hi.
FO300003517	<grumbles to himself>
FO300003518	<grumbles to himself>
FO300003519	Yeah, I guess I gotta find my own way.
FO300003520	Psst. Hey. Help me out.
FO300003521	<growls>
FO300003522	<growls>
FO300003523	<belches>
FO300003524	Whoa, sorry! I'll get out of your way!
FO300003525	Respect, man.
FO300003526	Holy shit, it's you!
FO300003527	We should grab a drink sometime.
FO300003528	What's up, killer?
FO300003529	Hey, welcome, buddy.
FO300003530	You're not so bad from what I've heard.
FO300003531	Heh. I've heard a few things about you.
FO300003532	Watch it.
FO300003533	We don't like outsiders here.
FO300003534	Get your business done and go.
FO300003535	Finding your way about all right?
FO300003536	I don't think this is a good idea. Do you really know what you're doing?
FO300003537	You know, you make a very good sandwich.
FO300003538	Nice to see  you. Carry on.
FO300003539	Hello. Hello. Can't stop to chat just now.
FO300003540	Now's not the best time. Perhaps we could parlay sometime later? Thank you.
FO300003541	I can smell the Rangers's fear!
FO300003542	This is taking too long. Want to get onto roof and rip Rangers limbs off!
FO300003543	Watch for booms. Rangers leave many behind.
FO300003544	Ha ha ha. Rangers bleed like all humans.
FO300003545	Don't let any more humans through. They try and help Rangers on the roof.
FO300003546	Stupid humans hiding on roof!
FO300003547	Good to see you in one piece.
FO300003548	You don't look like a merc.
FO300003549	Not bad kid, not bad.
FO300003550	So, you're the reinforcements, huh? Crazy.
FO300003551	Hey, all right! Me 'n Eugene are glad to see ya!
FO300003552	Well, well. We got us a genuine rescue, eh?
FO300003553	Please give me a status report.
FO300003554	Sigh. This is a long way from the Statesman Hotel. Why are you still here?
FO300003555	Whoa. Feel woozy.
FO300003556	Why are you just standing around here? My men might be dying!
FO300003557	You're still here?
FO300003558	What is going on up there?
FO300003559	What did you do?
FO300003560	We have to keep moving.
FO300003561	We can't stop now. We need to keep going.
FO300003562	Have you found any medical supplies?
FO300003563	We need to escape while we can.
FO300003564	Did you need something?
FO300003565	Are you all right, Madison?
FO300003566	Hello, little brother.
FO300003567	Hello, little sister.
FO300003568	Great, here's some of the local wildlife.
FO300003569	Back off, local.
FO300003570	You're not involved in this. You want to keep it that way.
FO300003571	Good to see you're holding up alright.
FO300003572	Watch your back and keep your batteries dry out there.
FO300003573	You've got a lot of nerve showing up here after what you've done.
FO300003574	Make it quick. And don't try anything.
FO300003575	I know what you did. Everybody does.
FO300003576	You again, eh? Nervy bastard, aren't you?
FO300003577	Don't think I've forgotten about what you did.
FO300003578	Don't even think about trying anything.
FO300003579	Crime doesn't pay, it just pisses people off.
FO300003580	Next time you want to talk to someone, stay away from me.
FO300003581	Just make this fast. I don't like talking to criminals.
FO300003582	There's a fine line between badass and dumbass, and you crossed it.
FO300003583	Make no mistake. Try something and I drop your ass.
FO300003584	We may be alike, but don't take me for stupid. I got my eyes on you.
FO300003585	Keep acting the way you've been acting and they'll catch you, lock you up and throw away the key.
FO300003586	I'm not sure I should even be seen talking to you.
FO300003587	Oh, it's you. Up to the same old crap, huh?
FO300003588	Sometimes being bad feels pretty damn good, eh?
FO300003589	You should be ashamed of yourself.
FO300003590	Next time, use your brains... I know you have it in you.
FO300003591	What's the matter with you? You can't get away with crap like this.
FO300003592	The way you're acting surprises me.
FO300003593	Your bad deeds surprise me, they really do.
FO300003594	Don't act like you didn't enjoy what you did.
FO300003595	You're as guilty as the rest of us.
FO300003596	We need more people like you.
FO300003597	Bless you.
FO300003598	You're an example to us all.
FO300003599	It's not easy to be good in this world. I'm glad that someone is.
FO300003600	I've heard about you. Let it never be said that there aren't some good people left in the world.
FO300003601	There's never been anyone like you.
FO300003602	Is everyone from the Vault as kind as you?
FO300003603	Where is this damn place?
FO300003604	I swear it was this way!
FO300003605	What are you lookin' at?
FO300003606	What do you want?
FO300003607	Talk!
FO300003608	What?
FO300003609	If you're gonna talk, talk!
FO300003610	Yeah?
FO300003611	All dead! They're all dead!
FO300003612	Get it away! My mind, it's burning!
FO300003613	No, no! Under my skin! It's under my skin!
FO300003614	Get out! Go away!
FO300003615	Here's the G.E.C.K. Our bargain is complete.
FO300003616	I suggest you remain outside the lab area. The radiation leak is severe.
FO300003617	It's good to walk these halls again.
FO300003618	Many of my stupider brethren are about. Be cautious.
FO300003619	We still have some distance to cover. Stay close.
FO300003620	Free! I'm finally free!
FO300003621	This would go easier if you'd just surrender.
FO300003622	You're just making this harder on yourself.
FO300003623	The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, it seems.
FO300003624	I never saw you.
FO300003625	Better not let anyone else see you, son.
FO300003626	Better not let anyone else see you, missy.
FO300003627	You were never here.
FO300003628	Hey, Chief. Any news?
FO300003629	Hey, John. Anything?
FO300003630	What's up, Stevie? Anything to report?
FO300003631	Hi Herman. Seen anything?
FO300003632	Anything to report?
FO300003633	You got anything?
FO300003634	Ah, young sir! How very good to see you again. I do suppose you’re looking for your father the doctor.
FO300003635	Ah, young madame! Very good to see you again. I do suppose you’re looking for your father the doctor.
FO300003636	Tsk tsk tsk. I’m afraid you’ve missed him. I believe he’s gone topside for a spot of fresh air! Should be back any moment, I’d imagine!
FO300003637	You're the one everybody's looking for, right? Well it's none of my business. Your dad always took good care of us.
FO300003638	You oughtn't be wandering around down here alone. It isn't safe, you know.
FO300003639	This Vault's been going to pot ever since that young Alphonse took over.
FO300003640	What's your problem?
FO300003641	You're funny looking.
FO300003642	Are you talking to me?
FO300003643	Um. Yeah. Please go away.
FO300003644	Why don't you take a holodisc picture? It'll last longer.
FO300003645	Yeah, what's up?
FO300003646	Eyes up here please.
FO300003647	Careful! The floor may still be a bit wet over here. Wouldn't want you to slip and crack your skull open, now would we?
FO300003648	Good morning to you, sir!
FO300003649	Good morning to you, miss!
FO300003650	Good morning! Stopped in to see the old man before class, eh?
FO300003651	Good luck on the G.O.A.T.
FO300003652	Morning, pal.
FO300003653	Back off.
FO300003654	It's in there. Has to be. Has to be in there.
FO300003655	You. You can find it. You're not supposed to be here. He can't stop you.
FO300003656	Lookin's free, the rest will cost ya.
FO300003657	Got something on your mind?
FO300003658	Don't look at me like that.
FO300003659	Got a problem?
FO300003660	Welcome to Moriarty's Saloon.
FO300003661	Looking for a drink? You've come to the right place.
FO300003662	S'matter? Never seen a Ghoul before?
FO300003663	Yeah, what the hell do you want?
FO300003664	You want something or you just looking to get your ass beat?
FO300003665	This better be important. I'm a busy man.
FO300003666	So, what is it now?
FO300003667	If you need something from me, spill it.
FO300003668	Fight the Good Fight, brother.
FO300003669	Fight the Good Fight, sister.
FO300003670	If you're here to help, you got Three Dog's ears.
FO300003671	Don't worry, the Three Dog doesn't bite.
FO300003672	You're safe up here, no worries.
FO300003673	Welcome to the eyes and ears of D.C.
FO300003674	Get away from me, you jerk!
FO300003675	Oh, hey there.
FO300003676	Back again, are we? How marvelous!
FO300003677	Elder Lyons, SIR!
FO300003678	Elder on deck!
FO300003679	Good work!
FO300003680	Snake life forever.
FO300003681	Hey, honey.
FO300003682	Hey, pal.
FO300003683	She is looking a little heavy.
FO300003684	Back off, kid. This is Tunnel Snake business.
FO300003685	I've got other things to do.
FO300003686	Get out of my face.
FO300003687	Have a nice day.
FO300003688	Hello, sir.
FO300003689	Hello, ma'am.
FO300003690	Move along, please.
FO300003691	How may I serve you, master?
FO300003692	How may I serve you, mistress?
FO300003693	Another glorious day in this man's army!
FO300003694	Mayor said to let you in alive, but he didn't say you had to stay that way. Watch your step, mungo.
FO300003695	I don't know why RJ's letting you back in, but if you touch any of my kids, I'll make sure you never have any of your own.
FO300003696	I know MacCready let you back in, but you stay out of my classroom, understand?
FO300003697	Hey, why don't you stick around and start a ruckus again? I think your corpse would be great fertilizer for the fungus.
FO300003698	Watch out, jewk!
FO300003699	I'm not supposed to talk to bad people.
FO300003700	Come on, start something again. I dare you. I double dog dare you.
FO300003701	I put up with Zip's shenanigans, but I'm not having it from an outsider. Keep your hands to yourself, this time.
FO300003702	Wanna hear a joke? A guy walks into a town of kids and causes trouble. Then they shoot him to death. Get it? Watch out, or you will.
FO300003703	Wanna hear a joke? A girl walks into a town of kids and causes trouble. Then they shoot her to death. Get it? Watch out, or you will.
FO300003704	Hey, you hurt any of my friends today? Because it's like this bad habit you've got. I figure I can cure it if I shoot you some, okay?
FO300003705	Ain't had enough, huh? Well, stay in line and everything'll be a-oh-fucking-kay.
FO300003706	Business is always welcome in Canterbury Commons. Even business with people like you.
FO300003707	We take property crime very seriously around here. I don't want to hear about any more trouble from you.
FO300003708	I don't know why you're still allowed back, but stick in line. Or else.
FO300003709	I've got my eye on you.
FO300003710	Just stay calm. We don't need any more trouble here, okay?
FO300003711	I oughta toss you off this ship for what you did, but the boss says Rivet City has to forgive and forget. Still, I'm watching you.
FO300003712	After what you did, I don't trust you. Stay clean or I'll heave you overboard.
FO300003713	Rivet City doesn't need any more deaths. The Council says I gotta let you be here, but one false move and you're gone.
FO300003714	You're here because I convinced the Council your business was worth the risk. Don't disappoint me. Oh, and don't kill anybody else either.
FO300003715	You're a lowlife, but if you keep your nose clean, we'll let you stay.
FO300003716	You're a petty criminal, but I'm willing to give you another chance. Don't disappoint me.
FO300003717	I remember what you did. This time you'd better respect other people's property, or I'll have to keel haul you.
FO300003718	People like you are bad for business. This time you'd better follow the rules.
FO300003719	I oughta tear you a new asshole for what you did to her. Do your business and get outta here.
FO300003720	Hey, clown shoes. I remember what you did before. Keep you hands where I can see them.
FO300003721	You better behave. Gustavo's guards are swift to take care of trouble.
FO300003722	Watch your manners.
FO300003723	You better not cause any more trouble.
FO300003724	So many failures. Must try more.
FO300003725	Must guard the birth place.
FO300003726	Need more stuff to make more us.
FO300003727	Fox talks too much.
FO300003728	Must find the Human.
FO300003729	Stupid small Humans, not enough meat.
FO300003730	Check the top place.
FO300003731	Keep lookout. Human is here.
FO300003732	Stupid Fawkes! Talks like the Humans!
FO300003733	Stay strong.
FO300003734	We are the law.
FO300003735	Stay on the right side of the law.
FO300003736	Always good to see a new face in the fight.
FO300003737	You should talk to Sonora.
FO300003738	Well, hello there. I heard we might be getting a new recruit.
FO300003739	Let your heart guide your hand.
FO300003740	May your powder stay dry.
FO300003741	Good to see you again, partner.
FO300003742	We are pleased to see you again.
FO300003743	If it isn't our old friend...
FO300003744	Ah, yes. We've been waiting for you...
FO300003745	...
FO300003746	That was some nice shooting. Taking out a Behemoth single-handed!
FO300003747	Just hold still. Your left stablizer's been knocked loose.
FO300003748	If you keep turning like that I'm going to crack your casing.
FO300003749	I've almost got it.
FO300003750	Ah, I think I've found the problem.
FO300003751	Don't be such an old woman. Just a few more adjustments and you'll be as good as new.
FO300003752	Try it now. I think I've got it this time.
FO300003753	Mom, are you crazy? What are you doing? Are you okay?
FO300003754	Come on, Mom, it's not safe out here.
FO300003755	May I take your order?
FO300003756	I'm so nervous! Just think. Diego and I will be husband and wife.
FO300003757	Caleb, have you been practicing your reading?
FO300003758	Do you think the Slavers know where we are?
FO300003759	Is everything quiet out there?
FO300003760	Four Score! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
FO300003761	You are truly a good person. So many others refused to help us.
FO300003762	Good day, sir.
FO300003763	Good day, ma'am.
FO300003764	Hello, ma'am. How goes your studying today?
FO300003765	Pardon my intrusion, sir. Is there anything you'll be needing today?
FO300003766	Excuse me, sir. Our food is running low. Three days, maybe four at best.
FO300003767	Begging your pardon, ma'am. Is there anything you need?
FO300003768	Good dog, Four Score. You love Bill just as he is, don't you? You don't go judging a man like them others.
FO300003769	Go talk to Hannibal, stranger.
FO300003770	Thanks for the picture. It's given me a lot to do.
FO300003771	I've almost finished that book, Alejandra. Maybe you could tell me what it means tonight. By the fire. Together. Alone.
FO300003772	Can we have something other than iguana tonight? Anything?
FO300003773	The head is done, but I'm still trying to fix the saying. I wish I had a better picture.
FO300003774	I'd still like to learn how to shoot, Simone. Will you have time tomorrow?
FO300003775	Hey, Four Score. I don't have time to play fetch today. Go bother Bill.
FO300003776	You don't look like a runaway.
FO300003777	We are grateful for any help you can give us.
FO300003778	Have you found any references to Lincoln's Memorial? Caleb is still struggling with the translation.
FO300003779	Bill, I have some sewing for you. Look in my room.
FO300003780	Tomorrow take a break from the Lincoln work. We need the crumbling wall fixed.
FO300003781	Bill found some ammo yesterday. Only a clip and a half, but it's better than nothing.
FO300003782	Come, boy. If you're good today, I'll give you a treat.
FO300003783	Well, who do we have here?
FO300003784	You'd like Paradise Falls. Help me out and I'll take you there.
FO300003785	Keep moving. Mister Walker is waiting.
FO300003786	I wish those runaways would show up. I hate this waiting.
FO300003787	What are you looking at?
FO300003788	Stop gawking. You don't want to piss of Mister Walker.
FO300003789	You'd fetch a pretty penny.
FO300003790	I'm keeping an eye on you.
FO300003791	I suppose you aren't as bad as I thought. Most Wastelanders wouldn't have agreed to help us.
FO300003792	Watch your step.
FO300003793	You should get your face out of those books and learn how to shoot before somebody puts a collar back on you.
FO300003794	Out of my way, puke.
FO300003795	Lincoln's head looks good, Caleb. You should be proud.
FO300003796	Thought I saw a Super Mutant out past the road. I took a shot at it, and it ran away.
FO300003797	Out of my way, mutt.
FO300003798	Humph.
FO300003799	Hurry up.
FO300003800	Time is wasting.
FO300003801	Find him!
FO300003802	Hello, there!
FO300003803	How do?
FO300003804	Heya!
FO300003805	'Scuse me!
FO300003806	Hey.
FO300003807	How's it going?
FO300003808	I got my eye on you.
FO300003809	<snort>
FO300003810	Hey, move.
FO300003811	Morning, sleepyhead! Sleep well, boy?
FO300003812	Rise and shine! How was your night, my boy?
FO300003813	Day go well for you, my boy?
FO300003814	Evening! Get a lot of work done today, boy?
FO300003815	How're you doing, boy? Is everything all right?
FO300003816	Hello, Dom. Everyone behaving themselves?
FO300003817	Dom. Any news I should be worried about?
FO300003818	Go away!
FO300003819	Hey, Machete. You on guard? I mean, of course you are. I mean, umm, never mind.
FO300003820	Hey, Derek. You did some fine work out there with those Brahmin.
FO300003821	Derek, been hearing good things about your work with the traders. Way to go, man.
FO300003822	Eating right? Hope so.
FO300003823	Ernest, the good news is we ain't dead, yet.
FO300003824	Ernest, I've seen worse nights. But we aren't dead yet, and that's always a good sign.
FO300003825	Hey, Machete. Report in. You see anything odd out there?
FO300003826	Machete, what's the word from your watch?
FO300003827	All clear out there, captain, sir!
FO300003828	Nothing I couldn't handle, captain, sir!
FO300003829	I'm not sure what to think about it.
FO300003830	It sure is shiny. I'm not sure I like it though.
FO300003831	What do you think it wants?
FO300003832	What's it doing out here?
FO300003833	I've got half a mind to salvage it. Broken when we found it, heh heh.
FO300003834	Damned survival guide. Must have been written by idiots!
FO300003835	Why don't you find your own hunting ground?
FO300003836	Greetings, fellow survivor!
FO300003837	Leave. I'm busy.
FO300003838	I told you to go.
FO300003839	You haven't seen any of those keys, have you? I seem to have lost one.
FO300003840	Howdy mister.
FO300003841	Hi there, miss.
FO300003842	Morning.
FO300003843	Evening.
FO300003844	How are you?
FO300003845	Nice to see you. Doing well, I hope?
FO300003846	How are things?
FO300003847	And how are you this fine day?
FO300003848	I knew you'd come back to visit.
FO300003849	Welcome back to Girdershade!
FO300003850	Swing that thing, sister!
FO300003851	When I look at you, I see two reasons that make me happy to be a man.
FO300003852	What are you looking at?
FO300003853	Got something on your mind? Spill it.
FO300003854	Yeah, what?
FO300003855	We owe you so much. The Memorial will be a beacon for slaves everywhere.
FO300003856	Everyone is grateful for what you've done for us.
FO300003857	The Slavers will have some goddamn respect for now, huh?
FO300003858	It's going to take a lot of work to repair the Memorial. Thanks to you, I'll get to do it.
FO300003859	You're a hero to everyone here, sir.
FO300003860	You're a hero to everyone here, ma'am.
FO300003861	We sure did a number on Hannibal and his abolitionists.
FO300003862	Those Temple Union slaves got what they deserved.
FO300003863	When I look at you, I see two reasons that make me happy to be a man.
FO300003864	Swing that thing, honey!
FO300003865	Whoa baby. Slow down a second.
FO300003866	Got something you wanna' say?
FO300003867	You find the soda, I pay up. Life couldn't be simpler.
FO300003868	What the heck do you want?
FO300003869	Hope you met Ronald, he's such a sweetie!
FO300003870	I am so thirsty. I hope you have something for me.
FO300003871	Hey! Anything I can do to help, just ask.
FO300003872	Oh come on, what do you have to lose?
FO300003873	Shhhh! The tour is in progress.
FO300003874	Well hey there, stranger!
FO300003875	Allow me to take you on my Nuka-Cola Tour. Won't take long, I promise!
FO300003876	<whistles tunelessly.>
FO300003877	<whistles tunelessly.>
FO300003878	Dashwood. What the hell are you skulking about for?
FO300003879	Dashwood. What the hell are you skulking about for?
FO300003880	Hey! What are you up to old man?
FO300003881	Hey! What are you up to old man?
FO300003882	Ahem. Dashwood. Don't do anything stupid.
FO300003883	Ahem. Dashwood. Don't do anything stupid.
FO300003884	You feeling alright, Daring? You having a flash back or something?
FO300003885	You feeling alright, Daring? You having a flash back or something?
FO300003886	You're behaving rather oddly, Mister Dashwood. Perhaps you should go lie down for awhile.
FO300003887	You're behaving rather oddly, Mister Dashwood. Perhaps you should go lie down for awhile.
FO300003888	Are you alright, Comrade?
FO300003889	Are you alright, Comrade?
FO300003890	Daring! What on earth are you up to?
FO300003891	Daring! What on earth are you up to?
FO300003892	You're up to something. I can tell.
FO300003893	You're up to something. I can tell.
FO300003894	Daring! What the bloody hell are you up to this time?
FO300003895	Daring! What the bloody hell are you up to this time?
FO300003896	Mr. Dashwood. Perhaps you should go take a nap, dear. You're acting rather peculiar.
FO300003897	Mr. Dashwood. Perhaps you should go take a nap, dear. You're acting rather peculiar.
FO300003898	What are you doing, Dashwood?
FO300003899	What are you doing, Dashwood?
FO300003900	Hello Chief Gustavo. You are looking positively fabulous today.
FO300003901	Hello there, Chief. You're packing a lot of heat, aren't you?
FO300003902	Doctor Banfield! I haven't seen you in New Urban Apparel for quite some time. Aren't you afraid you've gone out of style in the meantime?
FO300003903	An outfit a day keeps the frumpy away, eh doctor? Come visit me soon.
FO300003904	How are you, Mr. Cheng?
FO300003905	How is Mrs. Cheng these days?
FO300003906	Ah Lydia, darling. How's that old antique shop of yours doing these days?
FO300003907	Lydia, darling. What's wrong? You're looking rather frumpy today!
FO300003908	So, tell me. How are things?
FO300003909	You haven't stopped by the Urban Apparel in a while.
FO300003910	So, are you still hiding from that husband of yours?
FO300003911	Mrs. Cheng! Wouldn't you like a brand new outfit from Urban Outfitters? With a fabulous make-over, perhaps Mr. Cheng wouldn't recognize you!
FO300003912	I bet you exercise a lot, huh?
FO300003913	Hi there! That's quite some ordnance you're packing, isn't it!
FO300003914	If you're tired of sleeping in those barracks, let me know.
FO300003915	You got anything to report, Ling?
FO300003916	Doctor. I trust everything's okay?
FO300003917	Wellington. You and your wife getting along alright?
FO300003918	Dashwood. You're staying out of trouble, I hope?
FO300003919	Cheng. Sorry I keep missing your Neighborhood Watch committee meetings. Keep up the good work, though.
FO300003920	Ms. Montenegro. How are things? Any suspicious activity you'd like to report?
FO300003921	Ms. Primrose. The next shipment of food stuffs might be delayed. I was chatting with the caravan guard. Seems the Raiders have gotten rather bold.
FO300003922	Hawthorne. We've gotten a few complaints. Having trouble sleeping recently?
FO300003923	Mrs. Wellington.
FO300003924	Ms. Lancaster. How is the tower's favorite resident?
FO300003925	Ms. Cheng. How are you today?
FO300003926	I got a spot of blood on my labcoat recently. Any chance you've got something that'll take that out in the wash?
FO300003927	You feeling alright these days Anthony? It's time we do a regular check up soon; it's been a while.
FO300003928	Chief. There's something we should discuss. There's been an increase in "accidents" among your crew. I'm afraid someone's going to get really hurt.
FO300003929	Chief. How're things out there in the Wasteland?
FO300003930	Hello Lydia. How are you faring these days? Did those pills finally help you start to relax?
FO300003931	Lydia. Don't suppose you can scrounge up a few more holodisks for me?
FO300003932	Margaret, you work too hard. I might have to prescribe a vacation for you.
FO300003933	Don't work too hard!
FO300003934	Susan, I haven't seen you in a while. Shouldn't you be coming in for a regular "check up" soon?
FO300003935	How are you feeling today my dear?
FO300003936	Ms. Cheng. I'm worried about you. You're always seem so high strung. Stress is bad for the heart, you know.
FO300003937	You finding some time to relax, Ms. Cheng?
FO300003938	Still keeping the Wasteland at bay, Chief?
FO300003939	Ms. Primrose. How are you today?
FO300003940	Millicent, have you ever thought of making friends with the other ladies in the Tower? Not that I mind your constant company, or anything.
FO300003941	Are you SURE you don't want to make friends with the other ladies? You know, crochet, or gossip, or whatever it is ladies like to do together?
FO300003942	Are you happy, dear?
FO300003943	You've something on your mind, dear?
FO300003944	Still pushing back the borders of the Wasteland, Chief? A never ending task, that. Ah. But some days I do miss a good adventure. You're lucky sir!
FO300003945	Good Chief Gustavo! Anything interesting happening out there in the Wasteland?
FO300003946	How's that manifesto of yours coming along, Comrade?
FO300003947	Still having issues with your computer, Comrade?
FO300003948	How's the cafe holding up these days? I must say, your new menu is superb. You are a fine chef!
FO300003949	Hello Margaret. You holding up, child? You slave in that kitchen all day for us lazy retired folk. Ever thought of taking a little break?
FO300003950	Hawthorne! You going to come up for air soon? You're going to drown yourself if you're not careful!
FO300003951	I've heard Margaret's cafe is running low on pickles. You better not let her catch you, Hawthorne. You might wind up in someone's sandwich!
FO300003952	Hey girl. How are you doing? You need to slow down and pace yourself, or you'll be old before your time. Like me!
FO300003953	Marry me, Susan?
FO300003954	You manage to shake your husband again? Good show! If you'd like, I can show you some stealth tricks I picked up in my adventures.
FO300003955	I hear Irving's having a bit of trouble with his computer?
FO300003956	Comrade. Do you have something that will make me, you know, look attractive?
FO300003957	Comrade, how are you doing?
FO300003958	Comrade Gustavo! How are things?
FO300003959	Comrade Gustavo!
FO300003960	Comrade Dashwood. Do you know much about computers? My computer is not cooperating with me lately.
FO300003961	I've been thinking about taking up adventuring as a profession. What would I need to know before I do that, comrade?
FO300003962	Comrade Lydia, do you have something in your shop that my wife would like?
FO300003963	You have a nice shop, comrade Lydia.
FO300003964	You make the BEST sandwiches ever, comrade Margaret!
FO300003965	I think sometime soon I'll try that Iguana Bits sandwich Mr. Tenpenny is always ordering.
FO300003966	Comrade Hawthorne. You seem to get along okay with the ladies. What's your secret?
FO300003967	Cheers!
FO300003968	Tiffany. Why are you always off doing your own thing?
FO300003969	Tiffany?
FO300003970	Anthony, darling, you're looking rather bloated today.
FO300003971	I've got some ointment in the Boutique that should help with those bags under your eyes, love.
FO300003972	There's nothing to worry about I presume, Chief?
FO300003973	I trust everyone in the tower is healthy? No plagues to worry about, are there Doctor?
FO300003974	I've noticed some new items on the menu.
FO300003975	One day, you'll have to teach me to cook. I've always wanted to learn, but never had the time.
FO300003976	Ahhh. There's nothing like a nice glass of wine at the end of a long day, eh Michael?
FO300003977	Here's to being rich, eh Michael?
FO300003978	Not to pry, dear. But what is exactly the problem between you and your husband?
FO300003979	Tiffany. A toast! Here's to stupid men and the women who love them!
FO300003980	What will you be having for lunch, Mister Tenpenny?
FO300003981	I'll need another order of hairnets, Anthony.
FO300003982	You know, if they'd like to, your men could dine in the cafe. They don't always have to eat in the barracks.
FO300003983	I'll send over something tasty for the men later. A special treat of some kind to let them know we care.
FO300003984	Doctor, I've been meaning to ask you. Do you think it's safe to serve raw Mirelurk meat? It can be quite delicious.
FO300003985	Have you noticed the newer, healthier additions to the menu, Doc?
FO300003986	Here you are, hon.
FO300003987	Bon appetit!
FO300003988	Here you are. Sorry that took so long.
FO300003989	Here you go. I hope you enjoy your meal!
FO300003990	I made it just like you like it. Enjoy!
FO300003991	Hey! I know you! Care to share a drink?
FO300003992	Gustavo, pal. You need to lighten up a bit. Relax. Have some fun, right? Right. Life's too short for all that grumpiness.
FO300003993	Daring. I've been meaning to ask. Was it hard to do all those adventures with the radio crew tagging along? I mean, it must have been distracting.
FO300003994	Comrade. Come share a drink.
FO300003995	Lydia! I've missed you! Come share a wee drinky with me. How was your day dear?
FO300003996	I'm glad you're here. You're the only one that understands me. The rest, I think they are secretly laughing at me all the time. But not you.
FO300003997	Susan. Why are you always so kind to me?
FO300003998	I like spending time with you Susan.
FO300003999	Mrs. Cheng. Take a load off, enjoy a glass of wine. Relax. You're so high strung, woman!
FO300004000	Nothing like a fine glass of bubbly to make all things right with the world, eh Mrs. Cheng?
FO300004001	Did you find any of the information I collected at all useful, Chief?
FO300004002	Chief. I'm concerned some of your men have been sleeping on the job. Well not literally, I just mean, they don't seem that alert.
FO300004003	I trust you are still feeling satisfied from our last... "conversation?"
FO300004004	Why, hello there!
FO300004005	Hello Chief.
FO300004006	I'm not feeling well, Doctor.
FO300004007	Why Edgar, darling. You're looking quite handsome today!
FO300004008	Do I make you nervous, Edgar?
FO300004009	Daring, I'm positively bored here! You know, I used to have quite a different life before Tenpenny Tower. Sometimes I long for a little excitement.
FO300004010	Let's run away together, and have a real adventure!
FO300004011	Irving.
FO300004012	You must learn how to relax, Irving!
FO300004013	You're always so busy. Why don't you take a day off once in a while?
FO300004014	Where'd you learn to cook? Everything you make is so delicious. I'd just set the place on fire if I ever tried what you do.
FO300004015	Do you ever find it stifling in this tower? Like the walls are keeping us in, rather than keeping the Wasteland out?
FO300004016	Hey Anthony. I think I need a new dress. Something with a little color, if you got any thing like that.
FO300004017	You ever been married before?
FO300004018	What's the chance you or one of your men would trip and accidentally shoot my husband in the head?
FO300004019	Hello there, Chief. I don't suppose there's any way you could, I don't know, SHOOT MY HUSBAND?! Make it look like an accident or something?
FO300004020	Hey Doc. You got any poison pills in your hospital?
FO300004021	Is it hard to tell if someone has been murdered, or just died in his sleep?
FO300004022	You ever kill a man, Daring?
FO300004023	Irving's always on that damn computer, typing away at his stupid projects. I wish I knew about computers. I'd erase that damn thing!
FO300004024	I'm leaving. Bye!
FO300004025	Lydia, have you ever been in love?
FO300004026	Do you think it's possible to love someone too much?
FO300004027	Are you happy with your life, Ms. Primrose?
FO300004028	Is cooking fun? Maybe I should help you out sometime. You know, just to have something interesting to do?
FO300004029	You're in here even more than I am. And I thought my life sucked.
FO300004030	Nothing like a little ale to wash away the day, eh?
FO300004031	I'm afraid I can't stop and chit chat.
FO300004032	I'm afraid I can't stop and chit chat.
FO300004033	Can I help you?
FO300004034	Hello.
FO300004035	Hello, dear.
FO300004036	Hi.
FO300004037	Hey.
FO300004038	Help! Bomb!
FO300004039	Help me!
FO300004040	My God, it's about to go off!
FO300004041	You can do this.
FO300004042	Here we are!
FO300004043	Good, you're here!
FO300004044	Go on. Jonas is waiting for you downstairs.
FO300004045	How's it going, sweetheart?
FO300004046	How's it going, pal?
FO300004047	So what do you think we should call our gang? It's got to be totally killer, though.
FO300004048	Come on, Wally. You always have good ideas.
FO300004049	Show us how smart you are, Wally. What should we call ourselves?
FO300004050	Hey, Paul, your hobby's open. Whoa, that's your hobby? Ha ha ha ha! Now quick, give me an idea for what to name our gang.
FO300004051	Um. What about the "Tunnel Rats"? Or aren't rats tough enough?
FO300004052	Hmm. Snakes are cool, right? The Vault Snakes! What do you guys think?
FO300004053	You guys are dumb. Somebody's got to have a better idea than those.
FO300004054	Ah man, you got a Pipboy. I wish I was ten.
FO300004055	Thanks for inviting me to your party.
FO300004056	What are you looking at, dork-face?
FO300004057	Hey there, butt-breath! Ha ha ha.
FO300004058	Nice Pip-Boy. What is that, one of the 3000A models? What a piece of junk. I think you have to wind it up every morning.
FO300004059	Look Butch, I don't think his puny arm is strong enough to lift that Pip-Boy.
FO300004060	Look Butch, I don't think her puny arm is strong enough to lift that Pip-Boy.
FO300004061	Buzz off, pipsqueak.
FO300004062	Hey, happy birthday, nosebleed. Ha ha ha.
FO300004063	I didn't bring you a present, if that's what you're wondering.
FO300004064	Just because I came to your party doesn't mean I have to talk to you.
FO300004065	What are you looking at?
FO300004066	Hey there, ten years old today, right? Happy birthday.
FO300004067	Shouldn't you be in the diner at your party?
FO300004068	Having fun?
FO300004069	Wow, the Pip-Boy really makes you look all grown up.
FO300004070	Come on, try to look like you're enjoying yourself!
FO300004071	Happy birthday, dearie!
FO300004072	How are you enjoying the party, Mrs. Palmer? I helped with the decorations, you know.
FO300004073	Thank you for coming, Ms. Beatrice. I hope you're having a nice time.
FO300004074	Do you think we surprised him?
FO300004075	Do you think we surprised her?
FO300004076	Daddy, I told you not to act all official. I know you were joking, but I'm not sure anyone else did.
FO300004077	Thanks for coming, Stanley, I know you were busy with the water purifier. Everything's fine, I hope?
FO300004078	Hi, Stevie. Great party, huh?
FO300004079	Hello, Officer Gomez. I'm glad you could make it.
FO300004080	Fun party, huh?
FO300004081	Thanks for coming. Are you having fun?
FO300004082	Are you having a nice time?
FO300004083	Nice to see the kids having a good time, isn't it?
FO300004084	Thanks for coming. It means a lot to both of us.
FO300004085	Have you heard about Freddie Gomez?
FO300004086	Did you see his Pip-Boy? What a clunker!
FO300004087	Did you see her Pip-Boy? What a clunker!
FO300004088	Enjoying yourself?
FO300004089	Nice party.
FO300004090	Happy birthday!
FO300004091	George, I thought I told you to have a talk with Timmy about Old Lady Dithers.
FO300004092	George, have you spoken to your son about Old Lady Dithers?
FO300004093	What's the latest gossip from Mabel?
FO300004094	So, heard anything good from Mabel lately?
FO300004095	Hi, Martha.
FO300004096	Hi, Mabel. How's it going?
FO300004097	How are you, Mabel?
FO300004098	Listen, honey. Do you think maybe it's time we talk about having kids?
FO300004099	Hello, dear.
FO300004100	Hi, honey.
FO300004101	Good day, George.
FO300004102	Good to see you, George!

FO300004113	Hiya.
FO300004114	Good day!
FO300004115	Hello!
FO300004116	Beautiful day, isn't it?
FO300004117	Well hi there!
FO300004118	Good day.
FO300004119	Good afternoon!
FO300004120	Good day to you, young miss!
FO300004121	Good day to you, young master!
FO300004122	Hey you! Welcome back!
FO300004123	It's the hero of Big Town!
FO300004124	Have you come to talk to me?
FO300004125	Hurray!
FO300004126	There he is!
FO300004127	There she is!
FO300004128	Oh it's you! Hello!
FO300004129	Heya!
FO300004130	Damn, Dusky. You're a beast with that rifle.
FO300004131	Goddamn, Dusk. Pretty good shootin'.
FO300004132	Hey hey, Dusky. How's it going?
FO300004133	How's it comin' along, Dusky?
FO300004134	Initiate waiting for orders, sir!
FO300004135	Initiate reporting, Sir Dusk!
FO300004136	Knight Captain Dusk, Sir!
FO300004137	Damn robot. Worst bedside manner ever.
FO300004138	Aren't my party girls sweet? I just want to eat them like candy. Ha ha!
FO300004139	I don't have my Cherry pie any more. That bitch ran away.
FO300004140	My women are dead. I'm gonna have to get me some new ones.
FO300004141	Hey, let's get wasted. I mean really stinking drunk. Ha ha!
FO300004142	Hey, sexy, let's get wasted. I mean really stinking drunk. Hah ha! If you're lucky I might let you hold onto my love handle. Hah ha!
FO300004143	You've got a smokin' bod, sugar pie. How about letting old Dukov rock you to sleep, if you know what I mean? Hah ha!
FO300004144	If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your gun in it's holster.
FO300004145	Well, aren't you looking fine?
FO300004146	Hello, sugar.
FO300004147	Are you still here?
FO300004148	Hi there, big boy.
FO300004149	Whatcha doing, honey?
FO300004150	Are you planning on moving in, or what?
FO300004151	We should call this the wasted land, not the Wasteland! Ha, ha! Come on, Cherry. Let's get wasted out here.
FO300004152	Cherry! Oh, you are looking fine, my Cherry pie! I'm gonna have me a piece of pie for dessert tonight! Ha ha!
FO300004153	I'm thirsty. How about a drink, Cherry. I'm planning on getting totally plastered tonight, so what I need now is a drink.
FO300004154	Hey baby, I'm paying you to entertain me. So keep a smile on that pretty face and get me a drink.
FO300004155	I'm bored. We should get naked and do it in the fountain!
FO300004156	I like the way you jiggle Fantasia! Maybe later tonight you can come to Papa, if you know what I mean! Hah ha!
FO300004157	You aren't nearly wasted enough Fantasia. Come on, drink up. We're gonna get real liquored up tonight! Hah ha!
FO300004158	Fantasia, if you want to earn your keep, you've got to keep me happy. And you know what makes me happy, baby! Ha ha!
FO300004159	God, it stinks out here. Can't we go inside, Dukey?
FO300004160	Dukey, you promised to take me to Rivet City to go shopping.
FO300004161	I think I've had too much to drink, Dukey. I'm going to be sick.
FO300004162	I'm so fucking sore today. Can't we just sit out here and get drunk, Dukey?
FO300004163	Dukey, honey, can your Fantasia have the night off?
FO300004164	How about making it just you and I tonight? Let Cherry sleep by herself for once.
FO300004165	Smells like shit out here. Why the hell do we have to live right on the river?
FO300004166	That bastard just about wore me out last night. Can you try and talk him into giving me the night off?
FO300004167	I don't know how much longer I can do this, Fantasia. If I get the chance, I'm going to try and get to Rivet City.
FO300004168	I wish he'd get us some regular clothes. It cold out here dressed like this.
FO300004169	We're running low on liquor. Dukey is going to have to go out for supplies sometime next week.
FO300004170	We need a new mattress. The one we have is shot.
FO300004171	That election is getting pretty close, huh?
FO300004172	Who are you going to vote for, Bob?
FO300004173	Hey Jessica, you excited about the election?
FO300004174	Hey Shawna, did you do the early voting?
FO300004175	Isn't election time so much fun, Mary?
FO300004176	Rachael, can you believe you're almost old enough to vote?
FO300004177	Who would you vote for if you were old enough, Flower?
FO300004178	Don't you just love election time, Ralph?
FO300004179	Hello Mister President.
FO300004180	Hi, Mister President.
FO300004181	How's my first lady doing today?
FO300004182	Hi Mary.  I mean Flower.  Rachael!
FO300004183	Rachael, come play with me!
FO300004184	Ralphie, you wanna play?
FO300004185	Tag!  You're it, Ralphie!
FO300004186	Come on Mary, let's go play!
FO300004187	Hello Rosie.
FO300004188	Get out of my way.
FO300004189	Don't make me shoot you, Rosie.
FO300004190	Excuse you.
FO300004191	Hey, go clean up after the Brahmin.  It's your turn.
FO300004192	Man, the Brahmin smell awful today.
FO300004193	Ugh, another foreigner in the Republic.
FO300004194	We have someone new in my Republic.
FO300004195	Hey there. Are you gonna play Republic with us?
FO300004196	A Wastelander! Like in the stories about Dave!
FO300004197	Welcome to the Museum of Dave!
FO300004198	Have you heard about Dave, lady?
FO300004199	Have you heard about Dave, mister?
FO300004200	You're almost as big as Dave.
FO300004201	Hi there, honey. Have you spoken to Dave?
FO300004202	This place is a mess. Can't you do something about it?
FO300004203	Dinner is late. Again.
FO300004204	I noticed some smudges in the bathroom. Take care of it.
FO300004205	I love you, Mommy!
FO300004206	My room is all clean, Mommy!
FO300004207	Hello, Mr. Harris.
FO300004208	I'm worried about something, Bill.
FO300004209	William, we need to talk about something.
FO300004210	Mommy says that it's almost time for dinner!
FO300004211	I saw you napping, daddy!
FO300004212	Hi there, daddy!
FO300004213	Hi, Bill.
FO300004214	Hello, Bill.
FO300004215	I can't find Mortimer. I think he got out of his box.
FO300004216	Remember, dad. We're gonna play catch later.
FO300004217	Hey, dad.
FO300004218	You're going to love what I'm cooking tonight, dear!
FO300004219	Oh, what a handsome man I landed!
FO300004220	Hello, Jack.
FO300004221	Hi, Jack.
FO300004222	Uh oh, Jenny. Look at you. The boys better watch out!
FO300004223	Hey there, Jenny, sweetheart. Looking gorgeous as usual.
FO300004224	Hi there, honey. Don't you look precious today?
FO300004225	Jenny, you look beautiful today! You're like a little doll!
FO300004226	Jenny, honey, you look so cute in that dress.
FO300004227	Heya, Jenny.
FO300004228	Hey, stranger. C'mon over here, I'd like to talk to you about something.
FO300004229	Why are you still here? Go!
FO300004230	Are you crazy? Get out of here!
FO300004231	Don't be fooled by them!
FO300004232	It's a fine day, isn't it?
FO300004233	Glorious day, isn't it?
FO300004234	Well, hello there!
FO300004235	Good to see you!
FO300004236	Welcome to Andale!
FO300004237	The good Lord made Andale for days like today.
FO300004238	<yawns> I could use a nap.
FO300004239	<humming a tune>
FO300004240	Sit. Drink. Pay. It'll make you feel better.
FO300004241	Come human, come drown your sorrows.
FO300004242	We don't get a lot of humans in here...
FO300004243	Do you need a room?
FO300004244	Welcome to my place.
FO300004245	Scanning...
FO300004246	<growls>
FO300004247	<grunts>
FO300004248	...
FO300004249	Humans have such strange anatomy.
FO300004250	Do you need my help?
FO300004251	Do you need something?
FO300004252	What do you need?
FO300004253	You need somthin', hon?
FO300004254	You gonna stare, or are you gonna order?
FO300004255	This'd better be important.
FO300004256	Make it fast, human.
FO300004257	What is it, human?
FO300004258	<drunken muttering>
FO300004259	<hic>
FO300004260	Oh, hello there!
FO300004261	Are you following me?
FO300004262	Do you want to hear a story about the Wastes?
FO300004263	Welcome to Underworld Outfitters!
FO300004264	We'll accept caps from anyone, even a human.
FO300004265	Can I help you, smoothskin?
FO300004266	You'd look great in some Leather Armor.
FO300004267	You here to buy, or just looking around?
FO300004268	Scrap metal is in short supply around here.
FO300004269	I sure could use some of that scrap metal.
FO300004270	You need something, smoothskin?
FO300004271	I got work to do, so if you need something, spit it out.
FO300004272	About time someone did that.
FO300004273	Bastard got what was coming to him.
FO300004274	Jesus, what did Ahzrukhal do?
FO300004275	Oh my God, is he dead?
FO300004276	Did you see that!?
FO300004277	Yeah, what is it?
FO300004278	See? We're not so bad.
FO300004279	It could happen to you, you know.
FO300004280	What? Never seen a Ghoul before?
FO300004281	What're you staring at?
FO300004282	<belches>
FO300004283	<hocks something up>
FO300004284	<coughs>
FO300004285	<coughs>
FO300004286	<wheezing cough>
FO300004287	<clears throat>
FO300004288	Yeah?
FO300004289	You got something to say?
FO300004290	Enjoying your stay?
FO300004291	Don't let the smell get to you.
FO300004292	This is our town. You'd best be careful.
FO300004293	We don't get a lot of your kind down here.
FO300004294	Watch your step.
FO300004295	Just try not to kill anyone while you're here.
FO300004296	Don't mess with us, we won't mess with you.
FO300004297	Boy, you and I need to talk.
FO300004298	Ahzrukhal, boy, I need to talk to you.
FO300004299	Oh, oh! Mr Ahzrukhal, I want to ask you something.
FO300004300	Mr. Ahzrukhal.
FO300004301	Hello, Ahzrukhal.
FO300004302	Carol, why don't you get some rest? You look so tired.
FO300004303	Why don't you go get some sleep, Carol. I can manage things up here for a while.
FO300004304	Hey, are you okay? You're not looking so good.
FO300004305	Carol, honey, I'm worried about you. Are you alright?
FO300004306	Hey, Carol. You okay? You don't look so good.
FO300004307	Hi, Carol.
FO300004308	Hello, Carol. It's been pretty quiet around here lately.
FO300004309	Hi, Carol. You know, things seem a little quiet around here.
FO300004310	Hey, robot, have you seen any toes laying around here?
FO300004311	All clear, Cerberus?
FO300004312	Have you seen anything unusual, Cerberus?
FO300004313	Cerberus, run your diagnostic program. Code 662-847-B.
FO300004314	Cerberus, you're still making that god awful noise. Go ahead and run that diagnostic program. Code 662-847-B.
FO300004315	Why, hello there, Cerberus.
FO300004316	Cerberus! How are you? Programming holding up?
FO300004317	Charon. Charon! Look at me when I'm talking to you!
FO300004318	Charon. Charon! Look at me when I'm talking to you!
FO300004319	Charon. Come here. Now.
FO300004320	Good to see you, Doctor Barrows.
FO300004321	Hey there, Doc.
FO300004322	Doc Barrows! Good to see you!
FO300004323	If it isn't ol' Doc Barrows. Hey there, Doc!
FO300004324	Greta, bring me some of that slop that you call food.
FO300004325	Greta, bring me something. Preferably something dead this time. And not glowing.
FO300004326	Hey, Greta, can I get a drink?
FO300004327	I'm thirsty, Greta.
FO300004328	Greta, I have a thirst.
FO300004329	Greta, you got a second? I wanted a drink.
FO300004330	Hey Greta, can I get a drink?
FO300004331	I need a drink, Greta.
FO300004332	Greta, I'm still sober. Fix it, please.
FO300004333	Well, I'm not dead yet, so I might as well eat something.
FO300004334	I want some food.
FO300004335	Greta, can I get some food over here?
FO300004336	Greta, can you get me something to eat?
FO300004337	I'm starving, Greta. Help me out here.
FO300004338	Nng. Hungry.
FO300004339	Heya, Greta.
FO300004340	Morning, Greta.
FO300004341	Nice night, huh, Greta?
FO300004342	Hello, Mister Crowley.
FO300004343	Mister Crowley, hello!
FO300004344	Good to see you, Mister Crowley!
FO300004345	Hello, Mister Crowley! Nice day, isn't it?
FO300004346	Patches. Patches! Hey, buddy, stay with me here for a second. We need to talk.
FO300004347	Hey, Patches. Patchwork, man. Pay attention, I need to talk to you.
FO300004348	Everything alright there, Patches? You don't look so good.
FO300004349	Heya, Patches. You alright, buddy? You're not lookin' so good.
FO300004350	Hey, Patchwork. How're you holding together?
FO300004351	Patchwork, buddy, how are you holding up?
FO300004352	Hello, Patchwork.
FO300004353	Quinn, no one told me you were back!
FO300004354	Hey, Quinn.
FO300004355	Hey there, Tulip.
FO300004356	Hi, Tulip!
FO300004357	Hey, Winthrop. How's it going?
FO300004358	Heya, Winthrop. You got a second?
FO300004359	How's everything? Enjoying your drinks?
FO300004360	Yes, yes, how is everyone doing? Everything alright? Do you need anything else?
FO300004361	Hey, hon. Do you need anything?
FO300004362	Do you need anything else?
FO300004363	Hello, Citizen!
FO300004364	Greetings!
FO300004365	This place is going to shit, have you noticed?
FO300004366	Winthrop needs some help. I mean, it's not like he has any time to train anyone to fix this shit around here.
FO300004367	The air is off in the common house again. It stinks of sweaty death down there. I swear, every day it's something new.
FO300004368	Carol used to love this place, now it's like she hardly even cares. Have you noticed that?
FO300004369	Did you hear that?
FO300004370	That sound just won't stop. Do you hear that?
FO300004371	Do you smell something strange?
FO300004372	This drink is foul. And that's a Ghoul calling something foul.
FO300004373	This vodka really sucks.
FO300004374	Have you tried this? It isn't good, but it's strong.
FO300004375	This stuff tastes like Centaur piss.
FO300004376	The best I can hope for is that the liquor kills me before some mutated beast turns me into a snack.
FO300004377	If there were a God, I'd pray for death.
FO300004378	All I ask is to go quietly. And soon.
FO300004379	Hey, you.
FO300004380	Hey.
FO300004381	Hi.
FO300004382	Hello.
FO300004383	Hey. How's it going?
FO300004384	How's it going?
FO300004385	Hey, you. What's new?
FO300004386	Hey, man. What's happening?
FO300004387	Long time, no see. What's going on with you?
FO300004388	Hey, what's up?
FO300004389	It's been a while, what've you been up to?
FO300004390	What's happening?
FO300004391	What's going on?
FO300004392	What's the word?
FO300004393	What've you heard?
FO300004394	Ugh, you look like you need a rest.
FO300004395	I hope Vault Tec had some answers for you.
FO300004396	If there's anything else you need to know, you go right ahead and ask.
FO300004397	Oh my! I wasn't expecting any visitors.
FO300004398	I assure you, there's nothing valuable here.
FO300004399	Well, don't just stand there, say something.
FO300004400	Maybe we could chat if you have the time.
FO300004401	Kimba, um, I heard you helped bandage me up when I was on the table. Uh, thank you.
FO300004402	I was thinking of hitting patrol again soon, Flash.
FO300004403	Hey Sticky, um, uh, what do you think of Big Town?
FO300004404	I wonder if someone should work on the barricades again.
FO300004405	Hey, Red, can I stop by the clinic later? You know, just in case?
FO300004406	Hey, Flash. Patrolling sounds like a lot of fun. Maybe I could come out with you.
FO300004407	Do you have any idea of what I can do in town, Shorty?
FO300004408	Hey there, Pappy. I was out trying to gather food. Did you know there's not much food out here in the Wastes?
FO300004409	Hey there, Kimba. Is there anything I can do around town?
FO300004410	Hey, Red. Is there anything I can do around town to help out?
FO300004411	Sticky, it's about time you learned that I'm in charge here.
FO300004412	Can I help you, Sheriff?
FO300004413	Can I help you?
FO300004414	I don't like the looks of the barricades, Pappy. Why don't you redo them?
FO300004415	Timebomb, since you insist on staying alive, why don't you make yourself useful and help me reset the barricades.
FO300004416	You don't go far out enough on your patrol, Flash. A real patrol would cover a solid half-mile radius.
FO300004417	I'm telling you, Red, just let me run everything. I'll get those barricades twice as high!
FO300004418	Bittercup, make sure you're paying attention out on patrol. There are dangerous people out there.
FO300004419	Hey, Flash. How are you feeling? Any calluses from stroking that new gun of yours?
FO300004420	How are you feeling, Timebomb? Are those stitches holding together?
FO300004421	There's my Sticky! How are you doing?
FO300004422	Hey, Pappy. How's that wound on your arm?
FO300004423	Shorty, I want to gather everyone together soon about setting up the barricades higher. I'd really appreciate your, uh,  expertise.
FO300004424	Hey Kimba, thanks for offering to help me in the clinic.
FO300004425	How are you feeling, Timebomb?
FO300004426	Hey there, Sticky.
FO300004427	How are the patrols going, Flash? Are we still safe?
FO300004428	Hey, Red. Do you need any help washing bandages later?
FO300004429	Hey Shorty. How's our favorite little guy doing?
FO300004430	How are you doing, Pappy?
FO300004431	Hey, Sticky. Keep your stickiness away from me and my new gun. This is a Sticky-free zone!
FO300004432	Timebomb! How're you doing? I thought you were dead for sure!
FO300004433	Hey Shorty, you should come with me on patrol. The Raiders will never see you coming.
FO300004434	Hey Red, can I stop by the clinic later? I feel a bit sick.
FO300004435	Wow, you should have seen me on patrol, Kimba, I was all "bang-bang-bang." I must have killed a hundred Raiders!
FO300004436	Have you seen my new gun, Pappy? It's awesome! Bad-Ass.
FO300004437	Did you see anything on patrol, Bittercup?
FO300004438	Red, have you got a sec? It’s about this wound on my arm.
FO300004439	We're all going to die here. There's no way we can survive out here in this mess.
FO300004440	Hey there, Kimba.
FO300004441	What do you think of the barricades, Shorty?
FO300004442	Hey, Timebomb. You look like you're going to fall over dead.
FO300004443	Never thought you'd make it, Sticky. Out of everyone who died trying to get here from Lamplight, we get you.
FO300004444	Anything out there, Flash? The Super Mutants and Raiders are coming back soon, aren't they?
FO300004445	What are you supposed to actually do if you ever find something on patrol, huh? Scare them off with that rusty pistol of yours?
FO300004446	At least we made it another day, right?
FO300004447	I haven't slept in weeks.
FO300004448	Those assholes in Lamplight said that this place was great.
FO300004449	I hate it here.
FO300004450	This place gets worse all the time.
FO300004451	Remember to keep an eye on the north.
FO300004452	S'up, Pronto?
FO300004453	How's it goin', Pronto?
FO300004454	Don't think I haven't seen what's been goin' on around here, Bleak. You're makin' it dangerous for us all.
FO300004455	I see what you're doin' around here, girl, and I got somethin' to say to you about it.
FO300004456	Hey, Bleak.
FO300004457	Breadbox, listen. I need your help.
FO300004458	Hey, Breadbox. What's up?
FO300004459	Bronson, boy. You need to get off of that drink.
FO300004460	Look at you, Bronson, you're a mess. You need to stop all this drinkin'.
FO300004461	Hey, Bronson, listen up. Hey! Pay attention! I need your help!
FO300004462	Come here, Carolina, I have something that I'm wondering about.
FO300004463	Red, I wanna ask you something.
FO300004464	Hello, Miss Carolina.
FO300004465	Hey, Miss Carolina.
FO300004466	Crimson, did you hear what those fools were saying out in the yard?
FO300004467	I can't believe that Mr. Eulogy let's those fools out in the yard talk like that! Did you hear what they said?
FO300004468	Clover, stay nearby. Let's not cause a scene.
FO300004469	Clover, we've had this discussion. You stay with me at all times.
FO300004470	Hey, Clover.
FO300004471	Crimson, did you see that new guy walking around here?
FO300004472	Did you get a chance to check out the new guy, Crimson?
FO300004473	Crimson, did you see that new girl walking around here?
FO300004474	Did you get a chance to check out the new girl, Crimson?
FO300004475	Crimson, let's stay down to earth, shall we? No more daydreaming.
FO300004476	Hey, Crimson.
FO300004477	So Cutter, what's the good word? Happy to see me? Miss me?
FO300004478	Cutter.
FO300004479	Hey, Cutter.
FO300004480	I've got something to say to you, Mr. Eulogy.
FO300004481	Listen, Mr. Eulogy. We have to talk.
FO300004482	Respect, man.
FO300004483	Eulogy! My man!
FO300004484	What's up, Eulogy?
FO300004485	Forty, what do I pay you for? Have you seen this out here?
FO300004486	Goddammit, Forty, I don't pay you to sleep on the job. Look around here. Tell me what you see.
FO300004487	Dude, Forty. Did you hear?
FO300004488	Hey, Forty.
FO300004489	You seen anything good today?
FO300004490	Hey, man. Anything goin' on out here today?
FO300004491	Grouse.
FO300004492	Hey, big boy. How you holdin' up today?
FO300004493	Look at you, my boy! Fit as ever! You're as big as a tank! I always tell them, I say "My Jotun, he could lift a house!"
FO300004494	Haha! My boy! He is so big! Look at him! He could carry four slaves under his arms! He doesn't even need a gun to take them!
FO300004495	Where'd you get a name like Jotun, anyway?
FO300004496	Hey, Jotun. How's your old man?
FO300004497	Hey, Jotun.
FO300004498	What do you want?
FO300004499	Yeah?
FO300004500	One wrong move, and you're going in the meat pen.
FO300004501	Watch your step, square.
FO300004502	Keep walkin'.
FO300004503	You don't look like you belong here.
FO300004504	Goddamn tin can.
FO300004505	Nice outfit. You raid a vault or something?
FO300004506	Ug. Get away from me.
FO300004507	The man with the hardware. How are things, Pronto?
FO300004508	There's the man that keeps us knee deep in lead. How you doing?
FO300004509	Jesus fucking Christ, it's dull out here.
FO300004510	For fuck's sake, I'm bored. There ain't nothin' happening today.
FO300004511	Richter.
FO300004512	That boy of yours sure was drunk off his ass the other night, huh?
FO300004513	Oh, man. Jotun was fucking hammered the other night. I thought he was gonna kill himself!
FO300004514	Hey, Ymir. Do you want a drink?
FO300004515	Drink with me, Ymir?
FO300004516	Hail, Ymir.
FO300004517	<grunts>
FO300004518	Out of my way.
FO300004519	Hey, you're back. You get anything good?
FO300004520	You caught anything lately?
FO300004521	How'd that roundup go?
FO300004522	How's the meat?
FO300004523	Hey, how'd it go with that blonde thing you brought in here?
FO300004524	You went out with Ymir last week, didn't you? Catch anything good?
FO300004525	Catch any good meat lately?
FO300004526	Things are quiet around here. We haven't had any good roundups in a while.
FO300004527	S'up, fool?
FO300004528	S'up.
FO300004529	What's goin' on?
FO300004530	Hey.
FO300004531	Hey, Maggie! How you doin', darlin'?
FO300004532	Hey! Sweetie-pie!
FO300004533	C'mon, Maggie! Let's go over here!
FO300004534	I see you!
FO300004535	It's my turn!
FO300004536	Hey there, little Maggie.
FO300004537	Manya! Manya!
FO300004538	Darling!
FO300004539	Hello there, Manya.
FO300004540	Hello, Manya.
FO300004541	Hello, Miss Brown.
FO300004542	Hi, Moira.
FO300004543	Hey there, Moira.
FO300004544	Hello, Mother Maya.
FO300004545	Nathan.
FO300004546	A moment, Nova. NOW.
FO300004547	Nova?
FO300004548	Lookin' good, Nova.
FO300004549	Nova, can you come here for a second?
FO300004550	Hey, Nova. I want to talk to you.
FO300004551	Hello, Nova.
FO300004552	How are you doing, Walter?
FO300004553	Hello, Walter.
FO300004554	Hey, c'mere. I want to talk to you.
FO300004555	Hey, you. I need to ask you something.
FO300004556	Hello.
FO300004557	S'up?
FO300004558	Hey, how's it going?
FO300004559	Hey.
FO300004560	How are you?
FO300004561	Hey there.
FO300004562	Hi.
FO300004563	You heard anything?
FO300004564	What's goin' on over here?
FO300004565	Que pasa?
FO300004566	What's happenin'?
FO300004567	What's goin' on?
FO300004568	S'up?
FO300004569	What's up?
FO300004570	What's new?
FO300004571	Hey.
FO300004572	Yo.
FO300004573	I can't believe we're stuck out here babysitting a radio station.
FO300004574	Man, this sucks. I wanna be where the action is!
FO300004575	Status report?
FO300004576	Did you see the hit I scored on that Super Mutant the other day? One round, and his head exploded like an overripe Mutfruit.
FO300004577	Keep your eyes open, Brother.
FO300004578	Make sure you keep that weapon clean, Brother.
FO300004579	Let's see the Super Mutants try and take this place now.
FO300004580	Nice digs, huh?
FO300004581	Did you see the size of that Behemoth?
FO300004582	Welcome to the GNR garrison.
FO300004583	If you're looking for Three Dog, he's upstairs.
FO300004584	That should give the boys at Lost Hills something to think about.
FO300004585	Good old Mutant cleansing. There's nothing else like it.
FO300004586	Damn, we lost Reddin.
FO300004587	Galaxy News owes us big for this one.
FO300004588	Let's see the Outcasts do THAT.
FO300004589	Oh man, that thing was enormous.
FO300004590	Not bad, kid. Not bad at all.
FO300004591	A pleasure hunting with you.
FO300004592	Power to the people, eh kid?
FO300004593	Smooth moves, kid. Smooth moves.
FO300004594	Looks like the Good Fight has gained a new ally.
FO300004595	You got questions, I'm your answer man.
FO300004596	I'm sensing that you have more to say. Well, go on.
FO300004597	Got more on your mind, huh?
FO300004598	Wow kid, you look like you've got ten pounds of worry stuffed into a five pound box. Why don't you take a load off and tell me about it.
FO300004599	Got something on your mind? Spill it.
FO300004600	You look like you've got ten pounds of worry stuffed into a five pound box.
FO300004601	I'll be right with you.
FO300004602	The Mirelurks have been quiet lately.
FO300004603	Hello, Miss Vera.
FO300004604	We're running low on river water, dad.
FO300004605	Scribe Bowditch. I'd like to hear your report on those latest armor modifications.
FO300004606	Hail, Scribe Bowditch. All is well with your work?
FO300004607	Scribe Bowditch, I trust you are well. I'm here for your progress report on the modified Recon Armor.
FO300004608	Hail to you, Scribe Bowditch.
FO300004609	Hail, Scribe Bowditch.
FO300004610	Scribe Peabody. How does the day find you?
FO300004611	Hello, Scribe Peabody. I trust that things are well with you?
FO300004612	Hail, Scribe Peabody. I trust that your research goes well.
FO300004613	Hail, Scribe Peabody.
FO300004614	Hail to you, Scribe Peabody.
FO300004615	Rothchild, a word please.
FO300004616	Scribe Rothchild, sir.
FO300004617	Hail, Scribe Rothchild.
FO300004618	Hail to you, Scribe Rothchild.
FO300004619	Sir Scribe.
FO300004620	Sentinel Lyons, ma'am!
FO300004621	Watch it, Squire.
FO300004622	Don't you have somewhere to be, Squire?
FO300004623	Step lively, Squire.
FO300004624	Hail, Star Paladin, sir.
FO300004625	Star Paladin Cross, sir!
FO300004626	I saw that you completed your tests. What results are you seeing?
FO300004627	Scribe Rothchild wants a report on your tests. Have your results posted?
FO300004628	Switches are showing green. Ambulatory systems look good.
FO300004629	The weapons systems are showing red on startup. We'll have to spend the rest of the day scrubbing the system before we can try again.
FO300004630	There's a problem in the cooling system. I'm not sure what it is, but I'll take a look.
FO300004631	I have those results you asked for. I sent them over to your station.
FO300004632	Scribe Rothchild wanted those AMS tests done right away, so I went ahead and handled it for you.
FO300004633	Welcome.
FO300004634	The Brotherhood is at your service.
FO300004635	You honor us with your presence here.
FO300004636	Need something, friend?
FO300004637	So what's the latest report?
FO300004638	What was the result of the latest scan?
FO300004639	What's the situation?
FO300004640	Well? What's your tactical appraisal of our situation?
FO300004641	Hail.
FO300004642	Hail.
FO300004643	Hail.
FO300004644	Hail.
FO300004645	Presence detected. This unit has activated.
FO300004646	Hail.
FO300004647	Hail.
FO300004648	Hail.
FO300004649	Hail.
FO300004650	Shit, that was a close one.
FO300004651	What?
FO300004652	Tickets please.
FO300004653	What's up?
FO300004654	What do you need, sir?
FO300004655	Hello, sir.
FO300004656	Sir.
FO300004657	Squire.
FO300004658	Sir Knight.
FO300004659	Paladin.
FO300004660	Sentinel. What can I do for you?
FO300004661	Hello, Elder.
FO300004662	Dad, can I buy that dress from Bannon? I want to wear it at my wedding. I want to look special for Diego.
FO300004663	Dad, do you think you'll ever meet someone? I mean like mom? You shouldn't just spend all day cooking you know.
FO300004664	I'm so excited about getting married. You got my invitation, didn't you? You've got to come.
FO300004665	Hello, Mrs. Cantelli. Do you have anything that would make a guy be like crazy in love? You know, make him really horny?
FO300004666	Are you nervous about getting married?
FO300004667	I have something special for you, but I can only give it to you in private.
FO300004668	Diego, do you think I'm sexy? I mean, if you weren't a priest and everything, would you be turned on by me?
FO300004669	Hello, Mr. Holmes. Do you have anything new today?
FO300004670	Hello, Mr. Shrapnel. My dad wants some more 10mm rounds. Do you have any?
FO300004671	Hello, Mr. Bannon. Can I look at that blue dress again? The one with the really deep cleavage?
FO300004672	The prayer was touching, Father.
FO300004673	I know you could do a much better sermon. I could hardly stay awake.
FO300004674	Try not to drink too much tonight, sir. It affects your judgment.
FO300004675	This area looks safe, Mister Zimmer.
FO300004676	I'll have some water.
FO300004677	Brock.
FO300004678	Sister.
FO300004679	You've had too much to drink, Trinnie.
FO300004680	Miss Vera, could I trouble you for some vegetables? Whatever you have is fine.
FO300004681	Mister Buckingham, I'd like some vegetables. Whatever you have available.
FO300004682	Hmmm. No. I don't think you're him.
FO300004683	I'll have two Mirelurk Cakes, carrots and wine, if you have it, beer if you don't.
FO300004684	Angela, why do you insist on wearing such rags? I could sell you a most beautiful dress. Diego, would be positively starstruck.
FO300004685	Angela, why do you insist on wearing such rags? I could sell you a most beautiful dress.
FO300004686	You come in here a lot, but you never buy anything.
FO300004687	Must you always sit next to me in church?
FO300004688	Before you start in on me, Vera, there's not much new here.
FO300004689	Can we make this quick? I have a wedding to get ready for.
FO300004690	Welcome to Potomac Attire.
FO300004691	Hmmph.
FO300004692	When that little shit gets here, watch him. If he starts anything, kick his ass.
FO300004693	You've had too much, Trinnie. Go sleep it off in the back.
FO300004694	Every week you come down here preaching this crap. Why don't you just stay in your god damned church?
FO300004695	What'll you have? And don't say water.
FO300004696	What'll you have?
FO300004697	What?
FO300004698	Armitage.
FO300004699	You've got some nice stuff in here, Bannon. Too bad it's so expensive.
FO300004700	You need to raise your prices, Belle. You're practically giving this stuff away.
FO300004701	Belle told me to throw you out of here if you stir up too much trouble, Father.
FO300004702	Flak, I'm running low on ammo. What do you have in stock?
FO300004703	Let's not have a repeat of the other day, Flak.
FO300004704	Size doesn't scare me, Sister. Don't start anything that I'll have to finish.
FO300004705	Hey, Shrapnel. How's the gun business?
FO300004706	Tammy, why don't you take the night off and spend it with James? If there's a repeat of the other night, Belle is going to kick you out.
FO300004707	Tammy, why don't you go home? If there's a repeat of the other night, Belle is going to kick you out.
FO300004708	Don't you think you've had enough, Trinnie?
FO300004709	This is the Muddy Rudder. Cause any trouble, and you'll have to deal with me.
FO300004710	Care for a drink?
FO300004711	Hey, I'm not looking for trouble.
FO300004712	Don't forget to pick up your room, C.J.
FO300004713	Finish your food, C.J. There are starving people in the Wasteland you know.
FO300004714	Stop fidgeting, C.J.
FO300004715	Congratulations! I'm so happy for Angela and Diego. Have they set a date yet?
FO300004716	Are the Mirelurk Cakes fresh?
FO300004717	Henry, I'm not sure I like C.J. playing with that Hargrave boy. His mother is just dreadful, even if she is on the upper deck.
FO300004718	God has truly blessed our family, Henry.
FO300004719	Wonderful sermon, Father. It really made me think.
FO300004720	Someday you'll be the one preaching the sermons, Diego.
FO300004721	How was work today, Henry? Is Doctor Li almost finished?
FO300004722	Isn't it exciting? A wedding. We haven't had a wedding in Rivet City in years.
FO300004723	Oh! Hello. Are you lost?
FO300004724	Hey, Vera. Still dodging old Seagrave? He's got eyes for you.
FO300004725	Shrapnel, I thought you shot your own food?
FO300004726	Hi, Flak. I hear the Iguana on a Stick is good today.
FO300004727	Your little girl is getting married! How exciting! You must be so proud.
FO300004728	Gary, could I have some ant meat and a Nuka-Cola?
FO300004729	Come to spend some of your hard earned caps, Henry? I'm afraid I'm all out of moral superiority.
FO300004730	Christie. I noticed you never clean up the hangar deck. Just the upper deck. What, we aren't good enough for you?
FO300004731	Hello, C.J.
FO300004732	Go home, or get high, or whatever it is you do when I'm not around.
FO300004733	I heard you're getting married! Are you excited? Is Diego nervous?
FO300004734	Angela, what brings you into A Quick Fix?
FO300004735	Father Clifford is making more sense than usual.
FO300004736	Hi, Bannon! Mind if I sit with you?
FO300004737	See anything you like, Mei?
FO300004738	You know, we helped fix up those love birds up. I'm so glad it worked out.
FO300004739	Welcome to A Quick Fix.
FO300004740	Have you seen my husband, Paulie?
FO300004741	Did you need something?
FO300004742	Hey, Dad, can you tell me a story? Tell me one about when people could drink the river.
FO300004743	Dad, can I be excused to go play with James?
FO300004744	Dad, I'm bored.
FO300004745	Mom, can I have a snack?
FO300004746	Mom, why don't we like the people that live on the hangar deck?
FO300004747	Mom, is James' mom going to go to hell?
FO300004748	What do you want to do, James?
FO300004749	Excuse me.
FO300004750	Mr. Staley, could I have a Nuka-Cola please?
FO300004751	Hello, mister.
FO300004752	Hello, ma'am.
FO300004753	Chief Harkness, we should go over those reports.
FO300004754	Report, officer.
FO300004755	Hello, Seagrave. You shouldn't waste your time with Vera. You can do better than her.
FO300004756	Hello, Diego. I'd be careful with that jailbait if I were you.
FO300004757	Hello, Garza. Everything okay down in Doctor Li's lab?
FO300004758	You better be minding yourself, Sister. One more screw up and I'm tossing your ass overboard.
FO300004759	Hello, Father Clifford.
FO300004760	Hello, Flak. I've got a couple of pistols that need repair. I'll bring them by tomorrow.
FO300004761	Guns and liquor don't mix, Shrapnel. Leave the ordnance at home when you're in the Muddy Rudder.
FO300004762	Hello Miss Weatherly. Still letting that bucket of bolts do all your work for you?
FO300004763	How am I supposed to manage security at a wedding? It's impossible I tell you.
FO300004764	If you see anything suspicious, be sure to tell a security officer.
FO300004765	Hey, Security guy. This place is awesome. Don't mind me. I'm just admiring the scenery.
FO300004766	So what's your story? Me, I'm just experiencing my freedom. You know, wandering the Wasteland, doing whatever I please.
FO300004767	Dude, what's the word? You tripping or something? You seem really bummed out.
FO300004768	Dude, I believe in better life through chems, but you're taking it way too far. You gotta cut back some.
FO300004769	Hey, squirt.
FO300004770	Chief Harkness! Dude, what's up?
FO300004771	Hey, missy.
FO300004772	Brock! The bouncer man! Dude, I would love your job. Free booze, drunk women, and you get to crack some skulls too.
FO300004773	Stay chill, dude.
FO300004774	Chief Harkness. It's always comforting to see you on your rounds.
FO300004775	Have you decided on the message for your next sermon?
FO300004776	Father, doesn't it bother you to preach to an empty church everyday but Sunday?
FO300004777	I'm sure God hears your prayers, Mister Lopez.
FO300004778	Doctor Preston, may I visit with your patients? I promise to be brief and quiet.
FO300004779	Angela, people are starting to talk. I can't be seen with you like this any more. From now on only visit me in the church.
FO300004780	Angela, I'm not sure you should spend so much time around me. I am to be married to God soon.
FO300004781	What looks good on the menu today, Mister Buckingham?
FO300004782	This may be the happiest day of my life!
FO300004783	God bless you.
FO300004784	Don't go too far away. I'm going to need you to move some equipment shortly.
FO300004785	Henry, do you have those readings ready for me yet?
FO300004786	Let me guess. I'm perfectly healthy. I keep telling you I'm fine.
FO300004787	Anna, don't just stand there, bring me that equipment.
FO300004788	Janice, have you overbalanced the chemical mix?
FO300004789	Don't get in the way. We're very busy.
FO300004790	Father Clifford, I'll let you pray with my patients, but only for a short time. They need their rest.
FO300004791	Diego, I assume you are here to visit my patients.
FO300004792	Li, you shouldn't see this weekly checkup as a bad thing. All of Rivet City needs you to be as healthy as possible.
FO300004793	Mister Buckingham, could I get a bite to eat?
FO300004794	If those two lovebirds aren't careful, I'll be helping Angela deliver a baby before the year is out.
FO300004795	You're hurt. Fortunately, this is a medical clinic. Why don't you let me take a look at that.
FO300004796	This is a medical clinic. Please don't disturb any of my patients.
FO300004797	You don't look too good. Come by the clinic and I'll patch you up.
FO300004798	Diego, you have been fornicating with that strumpet, Angela Staley. Don't try to deny it. I have a witness.
FO300004799	Make sure the chapel is prepared for Sunday services.
FO300004800	Don't forget to prepare the sacrament.
FO300004801	Saint Monica bless you, Vera. You have truly found peace through the Lord.
FO300004802	Saint Monica bless you, Christie. How is your family?
FO300004803	Saint Monica bless you, C.J. Have you spoken to James about coming to church? I'd really like to see him here.
FO300004804	Saint Monica bless you, Henry. The work you are doing with Doctor Li is blessed by God as well.
FO300004805	I'm so glad you and Diego decided to get married. So many couples decide to live in sin these days.
FO300004806	Saint Monica bless you, Angela. I hope your father is well. You really should try to get him to come with you to church.
FO300004807	Saint Monica bless you, Mei. Remember, you faith will be your armor.
FO300004808	Your patients appreciate my visits, even if you don't, Doctor Preston. The Holy Spirit can be a balm to the soul.
FO300004809	Diego, we must pray with any of Doctor Preston's patients. Help them to heal through Saint Monica.
FO300004810	Suicide is a sin, Mister Lopez. Why kill yourself when there is so much to live for?
FO300004811	Have faith in Saint Monica, Mei. She will protect you from those that seek to hurt you.
FO300004812	My son, you are drifting through life. God can provide you a purpose, just as He did for Saint Monica.
FO300004813	Forsake the evils of alcohol, Flak. They tempt you with oblivion when you should be glorifying God.
FO300004814	I'll just have some fruit today, Buckingham.
FO300004815	Put down that drink and raise your voice to the Lord!
FO300004816	Trinnie, can't you see what whiskey has done to your life? You've sold your body to men and your soul to the Devil.
FO300004817	Belle, you are an unwitting servant of the devil. You serve his demon brew down here.
FO300004818	Deep down you are a good man, Brock. Come away from this den of iniquity. Come into the light of the Lord!
FO300004819	This is not a safe place for your soul. Do not be tempted by the sins of vile liquor in this den of iniquity!
FO300004820	It's a glorious day for a wedding!
FO300004821	Saint Monica bless you.
FO300004822	How's our ammo inventory? It was getting low yesterday.
FO300004823	Hey, Brock. Looking for more 10mm ammo?
FO300004824	Business or pleasure, Vera?
FO300004825	Hello Vera. I think I heard a Mirelurk off the starboard side. Think I'll get in some target practice.
FO300004826	The deck is quiet tonight.
FO300004827	Gary, two Mirelurk Cakes. And make it quick.
FO300004828	Welcome to Flak and Shrapnel's. Best god damn weapons anywhere.
FO300004829	What are you looking at?
FO300004830	You've grown up so fast, Angela. I remember when you first learned to walk, and now you're getting married!
FO300004831	I heard that you've been hanging around that Diego boy. Be careful, Angela. You know boys only want one thing, even priests.
FO300004832	Make sure to clean all the empty tables.
FO300004833	Taking a break, Vera?
FO300004834	My little girl is all grown up. After today, she'll be married to Diego.
FO300004835	Have a seat anywhere. Someone will be with you in a minute.
FO300004836	Are the Mirelurk Cakes fresh?
FO300004837	I moved the new plant beds under the sun lamps.
FO300004838	Doctor Li, the new shipment has been stowed away.
FO300004839	I have some spare time. Do you need anything?
FO300004840	Hello Diego. Has Father Clifford decided to ordain you as a full priest yet?
FO300004841	Commander Danvers. Doctor Li has asked that the latest shipment be locked up this time.
FO300004842	If you could move out of the way, it would make things easier for all of us.
FO300004843	Yes?
FO300004844	Anything to report?
FO300004845	Armitage.
FO300004846	Janice, I have something for you.
FO300004847	Janice, a moment please.
FO300004848	Is everything all right?
FO300004849	Hello, honey.
FO300004850	Hello, son.
FO300004851	Oh, great.
FO300004852	What?
FO300004853	Hey there!
FO300004854	How's it going?
FO300004855	Hiya.
FO300004856	Any problems in the Muddy Rudder that I should know about?
FO300004857	C.J., don't do everything James tells you. He's a bad example.
FO300004858	Commander Danvers, anything to report?
FO300004859	Ted, if you're still looking for work, Christie Young can always use help cleaning the Hangar Decks.
FO300004860	Hey, Flak. How's business?
FO300004861	James, you stay out of trouble.
FO300004862	Hello, Mei. I'm still keeping an eye on him. You're safe.
FO300004863	Hello, Mei. You seem much more relaxed now that he's gone.
FO300004864	Paulie, you need to lay off the chems.
FO300004865	Seagrave, got anything new in that flea market of yours?
FO300004866	Tammy, take it easy on the booze. You've got a son to raise.
FO300004867	Trinnie, don't make a fool of yourself tonight like you did last week.
FO300004868	Vera, you look lovely as always.
FO300004869	Mister Zimmer. Have you found what you're looking for?
FO300004870	Let me or a security officer know if you see anything out of the ordinary.
FO300004871	Shall we go for a walk on the flight deck tonight, dear?
FO300004872	How's your food, dear?
FO300004873	Attendance is good today.
FO300004874	A thoughtful message, Father.
FO300004875	He was on fire today, Diego. I could barely keep my eyes open.
FO300004876	C.J, have you done your chores?
FO300004877	I fixed the transformer, again. You should have power for a while.
FO300004878	Garza, you stacked those crates on the cables again. They need to be moved or you'll short out the system.
FO300004879	Janice, are those sunlamps I fixed the other day holding up?
FO300004880	I do the repairs around here. So if you see something that needs fixing, let me know.
FO300004881	No problems to report, I assume.
FO300004882	Mom, can I go to C.J.'s?
FO300004883	Hey C.J., let's play killer. You pretend to be my Mom, and I'll pretend to be a serial killer.
FO300004884	Mom, do I have to eat this?
FO300004885	You're nothin' but a talking refrigerator.
FO300004886	Outta my way, tin can.
FO300004887	Don't mind me, mister.
FO300004888	Don't mind me, lady.
FO300004889	Doctor Li, the new solutions will be ready in a few hours.
FO300004890	The waste water in the hydroponic gardens isn't draining properly. Could you look at it?
FO300004891	Garza, when you get a chance, remove the empty water tanks in the gardens and put in the fresh ones.
FO300004892	The work that Doctor Li is doing is just amazing. I might even be able to produce broccoli in the hydroponic gardens next year.
FO300004893	I'd like a potato and some carrots. Oh, and put some of this herb in hot water. If I'm lucky, it will make tea.
FO300004894	Don't touch the vegetables. They're fragile.
FO300004895	Some people are in such a hurry.
FO300004896	Ted, could you please not put your stuff on my bed or all over the floor?
FO300004897	Mister Lopez, would you like to talk? They say talking helps with problems.
FO300004898	A lovely sermon, Father.
FO300004899	Diego, try and get Father Clifford to put some energy in his sermons. Some of us were trying not to fall asleep.
FO300004900	Don't mind me.
FO300004901	Miss Mei, may I get you some water?
FO300004902	Doctor Preston, the usual?
FO300004903	Is everything satisfactory, Mister Washington?
FO300004904	Miss Janice, do you need a refill?
FO300004905	Are you ready to order, Mister Diego?
FO300004906	Are you ready to order, Mister Father Clifford?
FO300004907	Are you ready to order, Mister Sister?
FO300004908	Something different today, Mister Armitage?
FO300004909	Are you ready to order, Mister Zimmer?
FO300004910	Do you have any instructions, Miss Vera?
FO300004911	I am at your service.
FO300004912	Mei, you've been kind to me. I'll miss you when I'm gone.
FO300004913	Ted, you're wasting your life. Do something with it. How about I teach you to read?
FO300004914	Ted, you're wasting your life. Do something with it. If you don't, you'll turn out just like me.
FO300004915	Shrapnel, do you sell ammo individually? Could I buy just one bullet?
FO300004916	Father, I have these feelings of worthlessness. I just want to end it all.
FO300004917	Diego, I am a troubled man. My life has no meaning. There is no point in going on.
FO300004918	Gary, is there anything new on the menu?
FO300004919	Leave me alone. This is none of your business.
FO300004920	Don't mind me. I'm just taking up space here.
FO300004921	Hey, Commander. Just walking the deck here. Yep, just walking the deck.
FO300004922	You're tired, Cindy. I'll close up tonight. You go home and go to bed.
FO300004923	Ted, Teddy! I got some great Psycho. It's totally wow. You oughta come down to my shop and buy some. We could shoot it together.
FO300004924	It's the colors, man. The colors are amazing. You really gotta try Psycho.
FO300004925	Hey, haven't I seen you somewhere before?
FO300004926	Man, I'm so hungry. When I come down, I really get a need to feed.
FO300004927	Gary, my man! I'm so hungry I could eat a whole Brahmin. How about lettin' me put this one on my tab?
FO300004928	Angela, how would you like to trade some Brahmin steak for Mentats? It'll make you beautiful.
FO300004929	This is A Quick Fix. We sell all kinds of chems.
FO300004930	Wanna do some Buffout? Maybe a little Psycho?
FO300004931	This area is off limits to civilians.
FO300004932	Hello, Vera. I just got in a new hot plate. I can sell it to you at a discount.
FO300004933	Vera, I know I'm not a sophisticated man, but I am a man, and I can take care of you.
FO300004934	I'll have some mutfruit and noodles.
FO300004935	Can I get a Nuka-Cola?
FO300004936	Any news with Doctor Li's project?
FO300004937	Hey, Cindy. How's that secure storage unit I made you working out?
FO300004938	There's the blushing bride to be! Congratulations Angela. You and Diego will make a good couple.
FO300004939	Hello, Miss Angela. What brings you into my shop today?
FO300004940	Hello, Bannon. Anything interesting happen in the last council meeting?
FO300004941	Hello, Henry. I just got in some new torc wrench and some electrical test equipment. You should take a look at them when you're done eating.
FO300004942	Cindy, don't forget to bring by anything interesting you might find while cleaning the deck. It might be worth some caps to you.
FO300004943	C.J.! You're getting bigger and prettier every day.
FO300004944	Hey, Flak. I'd avoid the Iguana today. It gave me the runs yesterday.
FO300004945	Diego is a lucky boy. Angela agreed to marry him.
FO300004946	Welcome to Rivet City Supply. I've got a little bit of everything here.
FO300004947	Nice day, huh?
FO300004948	I can't get that god damned laser pistol working. Think I should ask Seagrave to look at it?
FO300004949	Vera. Don't see you in here often. Looking for something in particular?
FO300004950	Hey Brock, when are you going to trade in that piece of shit sidearm? I've got some sweet new ones here.
FO300004951	How's the whiskey, Belle?
FO300004952	Hey, girlie. This ain't a god damn dress shop. There's nothing in here you oughta be buyin'.
FO300004953	Gary, gimme some Brahmin steaks. And don't burn them this time.
FO300004954	If you want a gun, you've come to the right place.
FO300004955	Are you looking at me?
FO300004956	I need another whiskey, Belle.
FO300004957	You're not so tough.
FO300004958	Let me buy you a drink. You and Flak have a nice shop. Have you known him long? Was he born in Rivet City?
FO300004959	You'd be worth some caps in the right circles. Too bad.
FO300004960	Hey, you rusty tin can. Get me some food. Meat, any kind. And don't call me Mister Sister.
FO300004961	You can shove your sermon up your ass, Father. We're busy drinking down here.
FO300004962	You don't look so tough.
FO300004963	Don't slouch. Chew your food. And don't give me that look or I'll slap it right off your face!
FO300004964	Stop that! Don't make me smack you. I oughta lock you in your goddamn room, you little brat. And stay away from that C.J. bitch from now on.
FO300004965	Gary, you know what I like. Make it rare. Oh, and get James something too. Not too expensive though. He's been naughty.
FO300004966	Did I ever tell you about my husband? Got me pregnant with that brat James. Then he ran off. Asshole.
FO300004967	Hey, you. Don't trust those Hangar Deck people. They're all jealous of us cause we live in the Upper Deck.
FO300004968	I'm drunk. Don't try to take advantage of me. No, really. You wouldn't like me when I'm sober.
FO300004969	You're a drunk and a slut. I'm just a drunk. So there.
FO300004970	I'm outta caps. Can you put my next drink on my tab? Please Belle? I really need a drink after dealing with my brat all day.
FO300004971	Have you seen my good-for-nothing son, James?
FO300004972	Belle, gimme another drink.
FO300004973	Brock, how come you never put the moves on me?
FO300004974	I've got the headache from hell. Do you have anything that will help?
FO300004975	Flak, honey, buy me a drink. I'm short on caps, and I really need one.
FO300004976	Shrapnel! You're my favorite man. Buy me a drink lover?
FO300004977	Hey, Sister. How about that drink you owe me?
FO300004978	Father Clifford, I've been a bad girl.
FO300004979	Hey stranger. Wanna buy a girl a drink?
FO300004980	Can you spare enough for drink? I could really use one.
FO300004981	What are you looking at?
FO300004982	So you finally got Diego to ask you to marry him. Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
FO300004983	Angela, you are growing up so fast! Your father must be proud.
FO300004984	Are you getting enough to eat, Mister Armitage?
FO300004985	When are you going to get some new dresses, Bannon? I'm tired of these worn out styles.
FO300004986	Hello Cindy. Is Paulie off getting high again? You really should kick him out.
FO300004987	Hello Cindy. I know we haven't been the best of friends, but I am sorry he's dead. I know he meant something to you.
FO300004988	Commander Danvers. Walking the night patrol?
FO300004989	Eat what you want, Diego. I never charge you or Father Clifford for you meals.
FO300004990	Father Clifford's sermon was very inspirational.
FO300004991	Your sermon was very inspirational, Father Clifford.
FO300004992	I'm so happy for Angela. She and Diego will be so happy together.
FO300004993	Hello Gary. How's Angela doing? I saw her with Diego the other day.
FO300004994	Someone said the Mirelurks are out tonight.
FO300004995	Hello Flak. How's business?
FO300004996	Here for some target practice, Flak?
FO300004997	It's good to see you eat, Janice. How are the hydroponic gardens?
FO300004998	Hello Seagrave.
FO300004999	Lovely night for a walk on the deck. Thank you for keeping me company.
FO300005000	Mister Shrapnel. I need some 10mm ammo. Two clips should do.
FO300005001	Is everything to your satisfaction, Mister Zimmer?
FO300005002	Well, my metal friend. How are we doing today?
FO300005003	Have you heard? Angela and Diego are getting married.
FO300005004	Welcome to the Weatherly Hotel.
FO300005005	Nice to see you.
FO300005006	Madam, do you know of anyone in Rivet City that seems unusual? Very unemotional or too formal?
FO300005007	A glass of wine, please.
FO300005008	We're not having any luck, Armitage. We may have to change strategies.
FO300005009	Miss Janice, maybe we could exchange science notes sometime. My work in biological systems might be of interest to you.
FO300005010	Excuse me, sir. Have you noticed anyone acting peculiarly in Rivet City?
FO300005011	Do you have any salt?
FO300005012	Did I order already? If I didn't, I'd like Iguana Bits with vegetables.
FO300005013	Vera, may I have some Brahmin steak, carrots, and a glass of water, please?

FO300005188	Tell Timmy I said hi!
FO300005189	Run along now.
FO300005190	It's the only thing that can save us.
FO300005191	You can do it. I know you can.
FO300005192	Just a chance to sleep. That's all I ask.
FO300005193	Farewell, my friend. I suspect we may meet again.
FO300005194	I won't be long.
FO300005195	The G.E.C.K. lies ahead. Follow me.
FO300005196	Come, let's continue.
FO300005197	Take care, now.
FO300005198	You stay safe.
FO300005199	Later.
FO300005200	Hurry!
FO300005201	Watch your back. And don't trust that Roy Phillips for a second.
FO300005202	It's dark in those tunnels. Shoot first, and ask questions later.
FO300005203	And I shall follow.
FO300005204	Let's go.
FO300005205	Very well.
FO300005206	Whatever you say, honey.
FO300005207	Let's go.

FO300005213	I have to go, Dogmeat.
FO300005214	Get out of here!
FO300005215	Just watch yourself. I've got an itchy trigger finger.
FO300005216	Adios.
FO300005217	Please, do what you can to find my brother.
FO300005218	Good luck in the Museum. Bring me back something and I'll let you get a closer look at the Memorial.
FO300005219	I'd better get going.
FO300005220	Sure. Silas will tell them you're allowed up there.
FO300005221	Hey, thanks again for doing this for me, it means a lot.
FO300005222	Remember, my offer still stands.
FO300005223	All right, goodbye.
FO300005224	Come back to us anytime. The Family considers you a friend.

FO300005230	Guess I'll see you around.
FO300005231	Bye, sweetie!
FO300005232	It was good talking to you.
FO300005233	Just remember I got my eyes on you. We all do.
FO300005234	Say it ain't so!
FO300005235	Come on back soon, I may have some stuff for ya'.
FO300005236	Yep, take it easy.
FO300005237	Bye bye!
FO300005238	Don't be a stranger, it's nice to have company.
FO300005239	I'm certain our paths will cross again.
FO300005240	Just get the hell away from me.
FO300005241	Oh! Okay. Well, anytime you find yourself back in Megaton, be sure and look me up.
FO300005242	Sounds good. Come back and visit me sometime.
FO300005243	Goodbye. It's always nice to speak to you.
FO300005244	What are you staring at me for then?
FO300005245	Bye bye now!
FO300005246	Sure thing, don't let me keep you.
FO300005247	All right, see you later.
FO300005248	I'm sure we'll meet again.
FO300005249	Of course, of course! Don't let me keep you!
FO300005250	Goodbye Outsider, and good luck.
FO300005251	Have no fear, Outsider. I know you'll make a wise decision.
FO300005252	Speak to me when you are ready to be purified, but don't keep the Great One waiting.
FO300005253	This way, Outsider. Come along now.
FO300005254	Goodbye, Outsider.
FO300005255	I trust we'll speak again, Outsider.
FO300005256	May the Great One bless you.
FO300005257	May the sap of His wisdom sustain you.
FO300005258	May your spirit rest in His branches.
FO300005259	Farewell, Outsider.
FO300005260	May you remain under the canopy of His protection.
FO300005261	Sure thing.
FO300005262	That's a damned shame.
FO300005263	About time. I got better things to do.
FO300005264	Good. I was tired of this conversation.
FO300005265	Yeah, let's get to the action.
FO300005266	Let's go.
FO300005267	And I shall follow.
FO300005268	Let's go.
FO300005269	It is my hope that we will speak again soon.
FO300005270	Lead on!
FO300005271	Let's go.
FO300005272	Lead the way.
FO300005273	Let's go.
FO300005274	Stay strong, my friend.
FO300005275	Keep your skills sharp and your eyes peeled, alright?
FO300005276	Until we meet again, keep yourself alive out there!
FO300005277	Good luck out there. And maybe next time, you'll find something interesting for me, huh?
FO300005278	See you out on the road, huh?
FO300005279	Stay safe on the path you travel.
FO300005280	Walk well, friend.
FO300005281	See you next time you need that special little something.
FO300005282	Cheers, pal. Watch yourself out there.
FO300005283	We're not waiting here for long.
FO300005284	Wait here. I'll be right back.
FO300005285	If you're not back soon, we're outta here!
FO300005286	Wait here until I get back.
FO300005287	I'm not sure I like that idea. If you're not back soon, I'm leaving.
FO300005288	Wait here. I'll be right back.
FO300005289	I'm not waiting here for long.
FO300005290	Wait here until I get back.
FO300005291	Good, good. I'll know when you've completed your task. At that point, we can begin rebuilding this shattered world. Good luck.
FO300005292	I'll be heading out now.
FO300005293	Yes, please do.
FO300005294	I'll go pick up that vial now.
FO300005295	Find human time.
FO300005296	I leave now.
FO300005297	I hate this place.
FO300005298	Bored, bored, bored.
FO300005299	Must go find human.
FO300005300	Need more meat. I go now.
FO300005301	I'm leaving now.
FO300005302	Patrol not fun.
FO300005303	Hungry I go find food.
FO300005304	Back to work!
FO300005305	Yessir, Mr. Moriarty. More drunk customers, coming up!
FO300005306	Go!
FO300005307	Okay, son. Okay.
FO300005308	I know, I know, sweetheart. Now you run along, okay? Billy's got some thinkin' to do.
FO300005309	It's why you love me, Nova dear.
FO300005310	Well then. Until next time.
FO300005311	He he. You know, dad, for a sheriff, you're kind of a goofball.
FO300005312	Good answer. Now, fuck off.
FO300005313	I'm watching you, outsider. You try anything, and I'll be there.
FO300005314	You got it, buddy.
FO300005315	You're the best, Billy!
FO300005316	You're quite welcome, Nathan dear.
FO300005317	Ah, damn. Oh well. Thanks, Moira.
FO300005318	God, you can be such an asshole sometimes, Colin. Don't worry, the "princess" will serve her king. Happy now?
FO300005319	I hear you, all right? Loud and clear. I'll make daddy proud.
FO300005320	I'll talk to you later, hon.
FO300005321	Okay, Gobbie. Bye.
FO300005322	Please don't make it any harder than it has to be, Jericho.
FO300005323	Sure.
FO300005324	Roger that.
FO300005325	All right.
FO300005326	Oh, anytime.
FO300005327	Come back later. I mean, don't come back later. See if I care.
FO300005328	Later, spooky girl.
FO300005329	Watch out for Muties and Raiders.
FO300005330	Give me liberty, or give me death!
FO300005331	I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country!
FO300005332	There never was a good war or a bad peace.
FO300005333	I've not yet begun to fight!
FO300005334	I'm right behind you.
FO300005335	Let's get going.
FO300005336	Rivet City here we come!
FO300005337	Let's get going.
FO300005338	Keep your eyes on the mission, and off my ass please.
FO300005339	Let's get going.
FO300005340	I'm ready. Lead on.
FO300005341	Let's get going.
FO300005342	Just watch yourself, 'cause I'm not dragging your corpse back to Rivet City.
FO300005343	Let's get going.
FO300005344	I am getting so drunk when we get paid for this.
FO300005345	Let's get going.
FO300005346	Stay focused and we may just get through this.
FO300005347	Let's get going.
FO300005348	Come on, less gawking and more walking.
FO300005349	Let's get going.
FO300005350	I got your back.
FO300005351	Let's get going.
FO300005352	No Ranger will leave here alive!
FO300005353	The roof will run red with their blood!
FO300005354	Attack come soon. Wait 'til then.
FO300005355	I'll crush the Rangers with my bare hands!
FO300005356	Soon it will be our time.
FO300005357	Ha ha ha ha ha.
FO300005358	Keep eye open for more.
FO300005359	Sure enough.
FO300005360	Yep, no problem.
FO300005361	Kick ass.
FO300005362	No sweat.
FO300005363	Watch your ass, kid.
FO300005364	Don't worry. Me 'n Eugene's got your back.
FO300005365	Stay frosty.
FO300005366	Let's get a move on.
FO300005367	Get that fission battery then double time it back here!
FO300005368	Watch yourself, those ruins are bad ass.
FO300005369	Careful out there.
FO300005370	The Citadel is our only chance now. We have to make it there.
FO300005371	I am sorry to be causing problems.
FO300005372	I am sorry to be causing problems.
FO300005373	We must keep moving.
FO300005374	I really don't want to die down here.
FO300005375	Be careful.
FO300005376	Then leave. We'll do just fine without you.
FO300005377	I don't have time to deal with this.
FO300005378	Well, then, get going! I'm busy plotting!
FO300005379	At last, I can be done with your distracting prattle.
FO300005380	Stay wary, citizen. And keep your laser handy!
FO300005381	Stay safe, brave citizen.
FO300005382	Good luck with those two troublemakers.
FO300005383	Say hi to the Mechanist for me!
FO300005384	You never any fun.
FO300005385	Ah, I'm done talkin' to you anyway.
FO300005386	Forget it! You too dumb to talk to.
FO300005387	Watch yourself out there.
FO300005388	Good hunting out there.
FO300005389	Stay sharp.
FO300005390	Sure, fine. Get going.
FO300005391	Okay, I'm leaving.
FO300005392	Get a move on.
FO300005393	I'll be leaving, now.
FO300005394	Then get moving.
FO300005395	I'll just be on my way, then.
FO300005396	You're welcome back anytime. The Brotherhood never forgets its allies.
FO300005397	Just stay out of our way and everything will be fine.
FO300005398	Drop back in anytime, pal. We could use the company!
FO300005399	Okay. Just make sure not to interfere with our operations.
FO300005400	Be careful out there.
FO300005401	Suit yourself.
FO300005402	Anytime you need a place to crash, duck in here. Be glad to provide.
FO300005403	Right on, right on. Keep your radio tuned to GNR for the real gospel.
FO300005404	This is pointless.
FO300005405	Whatever.
FO300005406	I hope next time I see you, the Declaration will be in hand.
FO300005407	Remember, treat the document with care. It's a fragile piece of our history.
FO300005408	Be careful, the Archives are infested with who knows what.
FO300005409	Remember, donations are always welcome.
FO300005410	Remember, bring me back anything interesting you find.
FO300005411	Very well, be careful out there.
FO300005412	See you later.
FO300005413	Bye, Timmy.
FO300005414	Keep your head low.
FO300005415	Right. I'm out of here.
FO300005416	You watch out for 'guai! They're all over!
FO300005417	We'll see y'all real soon!
FO300005418	Y'all come back now, y'hea'?
FO300005419	Finally, I have the keys. Your job is done and you've been paid, so move along. I have a trip to plan.
FO300005420	Well, they may not all be dead, but I have the keys. I should have hired a better mercenary. Run along. I have a trip to plan.
FO300005421	I hate you!
FO300005422	See you, fatty.
FO300005423	You, too. Thanks again for your help.
FO300005424	Take care, Amata.
FO300005425	You've got to help me.
FO300005426	Bye, Amata.
FO300005427	Much later! Tunnel Snakes rule!
FO300005428	Later, Paul.
FO300005429	Get out of here, kid.
FO300005430	Bye, Wally.
FO300005431	Regulate.
FO300005432	Do not let this world taint you.
FO300005433	Stay righteous.
FO300005434	Hard work pays off!
FO300005435	Do good work out there, we're counting on you!
FO300005436	Come back anytime!
FO300005437	All right. We better get back to it. Be careful.
FO300005438	Yeah. Give me a shout if you see anything.
FO300005439	I guess it's back to roach patrol.
FO300005440	I am holding still. It's your old, palsied hands that are shaking.
FO300005441	I don't believe you. I expect we'll be here for hours.
FO300005442	Ouch! Do you have any idea what you're doing back there?
FO300005443	I think you just made it worse. Should I do this myself?
FO300005444	I think I'd rather just stay broken than submit to any further indignity.
FO300005445	Good luck. I need to take a look at poor Andy over here. His old gears just aren't up to this kind of excitement.
FO300005446	I've got to get going.
FO300005447	You take care of yourself now.
FO300005448	I need to get going.
FO300005449	I have big plans for Hannibal when I get my hands on him.
FO300005450	I should go.
FO300005451	Don't let me stop you.
FO300005452	Don't be a stranger.
FO300005453	I should go.
FO300005454	Take care of yourself.
FO300005455	Thanks. Bye.
FO300005456	Yes, ma'am.
FO300005457	Well, I've heard enough.
FO300005458	Yes, sir.
FO300005459	Well, I've heard enough.
FO300005460	Okay.
FO300005461	May the spirit of the great Lincoln protect you.
FO300005462	Thank you, Hannibal. I'd better get going.
FO300005463	<grunt> Right.
FO300005464	I should get going.
FO300005465	Yeah. Get me a thousand rounds of 5.56. You're a useless puke, Bill. Get away from me.
FO300005466	I don't know, Caleb. Ammo is tight. I shouldn't use it up like that.
FO300005467	Hmph. I suppose that little shit isn't totally useless. I'll grab it before I turn in tonight.
FO300005468	I've been reading about Abraham Lincoln. He was a very great man, Bill. A very great man.
FO300005469	I don't think that would be a good idea, Caleb. How about we talk about it tomorrow morning? Maybe during your lesson.
FO300005470	Just the ones I already gave him. There might be some in the museum though.
FO300005471	I hate guns. Besides, the pen is mightier than the sword. Or the assault rifle.
FO300005472	Bless you, ma'am.
FO300005473	Bless you, sir.
FO300005474	It's good of you to say so, miss Alejandra.
FO300005475	Terribly sorry, sir. It's what we got the most of. I can try frying it instead of boiling it if you like.
FO300005476	Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
FO300005477	Yes, ma'am. Begging your pardon, ma'am.
FO300005478	I've got work to do.
FO300005479	I should let you get back to work. Goodbye.
FO300005480	When I get time. Maybe once or twice a week. I'll try to do better.
FO300005481	I need more steel rods. At least as long as your arm. I'll take as many of them as you can find, and don't mind the rust.
FO300005482	Sure thing, Hannibal.
FO300005483	Thank you, Simone. I just wish the words were going as well.
FO300005484	Good luck against those Super Mutants.
FO300005485	Well, I should get started. Goodbye.
FO300005486	I hope we can make it to the Memorial by sundown.
FO300005487	So long.
FO300005488	I don't think so. Don't worry. We're well armed, and soon we'll have a new home, safe from them.
FO300005489	Simone and I will go hunting soon. Probably tomorrow.
FO300005490	Next time don't waste the ammo. Wait for it to get closer.
FO300005491	Remember that the Department of Tourist Rights only guarantees your safety for 24 hours. After that time, you will be executed.
FO300005492	Goodbye, Mister President.
FO300005493	Very well. Goodbye, Ambassador.
FO300005494	I'm going to go tour the Republic.
FO300005495	You are safe here so long as you obey me, refugee.
FO300005496	I'm going to go tour the Republic.
FO300005497	All spies say that.
FO300005498	I think I'll just be going.
FO300005499	Finally, a chance to recant my mistake! How marvelous!
FO300005500	I have important calculations to attend to. Good day.
FO300005501	I would ask if you'd keep the interruptions to a minimum.
FO300005502	 I wish I was tough like you!
FO300005503	I wish you could stay here with me in Grayditch.
FO300005504	You're pretty swell for a grownup!
FO300005505	Stomp those stupid Ants!
FO300005506	Kill those ants dead!
FO300005507	Now I can never go home!
FO300005508	If you look around enough in Grayditch you might find some useful stuff people left behind.
FO300005509	Please be careful, I don't want you to die either.
FO300005510	Sigh. I just wish things would go back to how they used to be.
FO300005511	Be careful or those things might getcha.
FO300005512	Goodbye. Take care of yourself.
FO300005513	Goodbye, Rosie.
FO300005514	Stay away from Dave. He's mine.
FO300005515	See you, Jessica.
FO300005516	You're safe as long as Dave says so.
FO300005517	See you, Jessica.
FO300005518	Come back and visit the museum anytime!
FO300005519	I'll leave you to the kids.
FO300005520	Just don't bother me. I've got stuff to do for Dave.
FO300005521	Later, Bob.
FO300005522	I have to go practice my Dave impression, anyway.
FO300005523	Talk to you later, kid.
FO300005524	Goodbye, Miss Not-Mommy.
FO300005525	Talk to you later, kid.
FO300005526	Goodbye, Mister Not-Dave.
FO300005527	Talk to you later, kid.
FO300005528	That's what Dave always says.
FO300005529	Talk to you later, kid.
FO300005530	Hurray for the Republic! <giggles>
FO300005531	Talk to you later, kid.
FO300005532	Be back soon! And bring more caps!
FO300005533	I'll be on my way.
FO300005534	I'll be watching you.
FO300005535	I'm leaving.
FO300005536	Careful out there.
FO300005537	Sure.
FO300005538	I guess I'll be going.
FO300005539	<grunts>
FO300005540	I guess I'll be going.
FO300005541	Come back soon!
FO300005542	See you next time!
FO300005543	I suppose there's no chance for a nice conversation today, is there.
FO300005544	I'm fine, okay?
FO300005545	If you insist, Derek. If you wanna talk later, I'm around.
FO300005546	You're the boss, man. We can talk about it later, if you want.
FO300005547	Sounds like a good plan.
FO300005548	You know you can rely on me for that.
FO300005549	Good. See you later. And you better show up!
FO300005550	You'd better believe it.
FO300005551	I mean it.
FO300005552	Great! I'll see you later, Machete!
FO300005553	No problem, Machete. See you later.
FO300005554	Of course.
FO300005555	I'll see what I can do.
FO300005556	Yes, I should say that you do.
FO300005557	I have to go. Now.
FO300005558	Take a look around if you want, but please be quick. You may have left, but this is the only world we know, and we need your help.
FO300005559	I need a little time to think about this, Amata.
FO300005560	Please, convince the Overseer to stop the lockdown. We're all counting on you.
FO300005561	Let me see what I can do.
FO300005562	Be careful.
FO300005563	Well, okay. Just be careful down here. The Vault's changed, I tell you.
FO300005564	I'll go see what I can do about all of this.
FO300005565	Catch you later. Maybe.
FO300005566	I'll be going, now.
FO300005567	Whatever.
FO300005568	I'll be going, now.
FO300005569	Watch yourself down here.
FO300005570	Oh, please be careful.
FO300005571	Yes, you do.
FO300005572	Yeah, right.
FO300005573	Will do. You too.
FO300005574	I'll keep talking with them. Who else am I gonna hang out with?
FO300005575	Man, way to be a buzzkill.
FO300005576	Come on, cheer up. Paul wouldn't want you moping around like that.
FO300005577	I have no doubt that we shall. No doubt at all.
FO300005578	We certainly shall. In time, everything will be solved.
FO300005579	Harrumph.
FO300005580	He's not listening to me. But there's someone else who might be able to convince him. We'll see.
FO300005581	Sure you will, Butch. Sure you will.
FO300005582	I'll keep myself safe if you do the same, Amata.
FO300005583	That'd be fun, like a slumber party!
FO300005584	Don't be silly, Susie.
FO300005585	Well, just be careful, okay?
FO300005586	All right, dear. Just don't get into any trouble.
FO300005587	I hope to see you again. I've very much enjoyed our chat together.
FO300005588	I'm glad you stopped by to see me.
FO300005589	Please, come and see me again.
FO300005590	See you around, mister.
FO300005591	I'll talk to you later.
FO300005592	Okay, miss. See you around.
FO300005593	I'll talk to you later.
FO300005594	Okay, bye.
FO300005595	I need to get going.
FO300005596	Yeah, me too.
FO300005597	Time for me to go.
FO300005598	Yeah. See you.
FO300005599	Whatever.
FO300005600	Goodbye.
FO300005601	Later.
FO300005602	Time for me to go.
FO300005603	Have a wonderful and productive day.
FO300005604	Whatever floats your boat, sweetcheeks.
FO300005605	Sure thing, honey.
FO300005606	Baby, I hate it when you leave, but I love watching you go.
FO300005607	Suit yourself.
FO300005608	Fine, I don't care.
FO300005609	Whatever.
FO300005610	Bye bye, now.
FO300005611	Be careful out there, sweetie!
FO300005612	Awww, sorry you got to go.
FO300005613	Sure thing, honey.
FO300005614	Baby, I hate it when you leave, but I love watching you go.
FO300005615	Just remember, only one that's gonna' lay a finger on her is me. Got it?
FO300005616	Good, then stop gawking and get me some Quantum.
FO300005617	Just watch your ass around Sierra. She's mine.
FO300005618	Good luck! Watch out for meanies!
FO300005619	Hurry back, maybe I'll make some of my legendary Quantum Sorbet!
FO300005620	That's okay, take your time and don't break the bottles!
FO300005621	Be careful out there, sweetie!
FO300005622	I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait!
FO300005623	Awww, sorry you got to go.
FO300005624	Good work.
FO300005625	You can do it. Just aim and shoot.
FO300005626	Come on. Let's go.
FO300005627	Happy birthday, honey.
FO300005628	Happy birthday, son.
FO300005629	Thanks. I'll send him right down.
FO300005630	Thanks. I'll send her right down.
FO300005631	Who wants to go around all day being called a "Vault Dweller"? Sometimes I think you really are as dumb as you look.
FO300005632	Jeez, Wally. Who's the head of the gang, you or me? No way.
FO300005633	Nice try. But shouldn't it be "The Big Cheese and Wally"? And why do you always have to get your name in there?
FO300005634	We're not naming ourselves after you. Drop it, all right?
FO300005635	Well at least it doesn't have your name in it somewhere. Which makes it better than any of your other ideas.
FO300005636	I never said I didn't like it. I just haven't made up my mind yet, okay?
FO300005637	Paul, you really are as dumb as you look, aren't you? Sounds like a washing machine or something.
FO300005638	Shut up, Paul. Ha ha ha! Look at his face.
FO300005639	I'll tell you one person who's not going to be in it. You! Ha ha ha. Just kidding, Paul. No I wasn't. Yes I was. Psych! Ha ha ha.
FO300005640	Go ahead and punk out if you want. Me and Wally will find somebody else to be in our gang.
FO300005641	Hmm. Grease Weasels. Pretty good. But is a weasel scary, or just goofy? They've got teeth and everything, right?
FO300005642	I said I'd think about it. Come on, we need some new ones.
FO300005643	Shut up and let me think a minute.
FO300005644	Oh, never mind. I can't believe my mom made me come to this stupid party.
FO300005645	Buck up, Butch. You always have good ideas.
FO300005646	I'm trying, Butch. I just can't think of anything right now.
FO300005647	Don't worry about it, Butch. You'll think of something. I know you will.
FO300005648	You guys crack me up.
FO300005649	Whatever. Can we talk about something else already?
FO300005650	Get outta here.
FO300005651	Fine, go.
FO300005652	I'm out of here.
FO300005653	Don't screw up, okay?
FO300005654	Right. Sure, thanks for asking. Well, I'll see you later.
FO300005655	Okay, yeah. Thanks for asking. I'll catch up with you later.
FO300005656	Bye bye!
FO300005657	Have a great day!
FO300005658	Take care now!
FO300005659	Have fun out there, okay?
FO300005660	Good luck with that research!
FO300005661	Try not to die!
FO300005662	The info you're bringing back is great. Looking forward to more!
FO300005663	Keep up the great research, super-assistant!
FO300005664	Thanks again for saving my life at the police station.
FO300005665	I showed you my new gun already, didn't I?
FO300005666	Don't be a stranger!
FO300005667	Remember: If you ever need a side kick, I'm your man!
FO300005668	Go kick some ass!
FO300005669	Thanks again for everything!
FO300005670	I like you.
FO300005671	Careful of the Mutants!
FO300005672	Be careful!
FO300005673	We need to get out of here! Move it!
FO300005674	If those Muties try to take me again, I'll give THEM something to worry about for a change!
FO300005675	Keep an eye out for Muties!
FO300005676	We're all going to die!
FO300005677	If the Mutants get you, come back and haunt me.
FO300005678	I'm worried about Red!
FO300005679	Big Town's not exactly what I though it would be. If you ever need a side kick, let me know!
FO300005680	I'm so tired of being frightened all the time!
FO300005681	Watch yourself out there.
FO300005682	Don't let the door hit you on the ass, clown shoes. Hah ha!
FO300005683	I'd better leave.
FO300005684	Don't let the door hit your sweet, sweet ass. Hah ha!
FO300005685	I really need to leave now.
FO300005686	Take care, sugar.
FO300005687	So long, Cherry.
FO300005688	Bye, bye, honey.
FO300005689	See ya later.
FO300005690	We'll catch you later!
FO300005691	Come back and see us soon!
FO300005692	Hey, you have a great day!
FO300005693	You should really stop by for dinner sometime.
FO300005694	I'll tell Linda and Junior that you said hello!
FO300005695	C'mon back anytime! We look forward to having you!
FO300005696	Bye bye!
FO300005697	Talk to you later!
FO300005698	If you see Junior, tell him that I said hi!
FO300005699	So long!
FO300005700	Dad says that I shouldn't want to leave Andale, but I do!
FO300005701	Gosh, I wish I could go with you!
FO300005702	Goodbye now!
FO300005703	Come back soon!
FO300005704	I really look forward to preparing you for dinner sometime!
FO300005705	Really, don't be such a stranger.
FO300005706	C'mon back to our home anytime!
FO300005707	We'll see you again, won't we?
FO300005708	We'll see you real soon!
FO300005709	Get out! Get out while you can!
FO300005710	Run, stranger! Run!
FO300005711	Go, get out of here before they get you too!
FO300005712	So long, buddy.
FO300005713	We'll catch you later.
FO300005714	Feel free to lay your troubles at my doorstep. Just bring some caps with you when you do.
FO300005715	Everyone's got troubles, and everyone brings 'em to me.
FO300005716	There are no worries that can't be left behind with the help of a little alcohol.
FO300005717	You come back real soon now!
FO300005718	Don't let these people get to you.
FO300005719	Closing dialog system.
FO300005720	Resuming patrol.
FO300005721	Come back if you need anything.
FO300005722	You be careful now.
FO300005723	Let me know if you have any of that Scrap Metal to sell!
FO300005724	You'll be back.
FO300005725	Come back when you're hungry.
FO300005726	What? Not full yet?
FO300005727	You humans have such weak stomachs.
FO300005728	Remember: no charge!
FO300005729	Let me know if you need something.
FO300005730	You can't go! After all that, you're not giving me the Stradivarius?
FO300005731	Please! I must have that violin!
FO300005732	I'm getting so excited I could scream!
FO300005733	Looks like a long hike to Vault 92. Be careful!
FO300005734	Watch yourself out there!
FO300005735	Be careful, I don't want to be responsible for getting you killed.
FO300005736	No! Don't go!
FO300005737	Oh, please stay. There's so much more to tell.
FO300005738	Leaving so soon?
FO300005739	If you see anyone from Lamplight, tell them to be careful.
FO300005740	I'm going to go look around town.
FO300005741	We're doomed and so are you if you stick around.
FO300005742	I'm going to go look around town.
FO300005743	Don't get yourself hurt. I have enough red on my clothes already.
FO300005744	Goodbye, Red.
FO300005745	Stay clear of mutants. Especially the big, hungry ones.
FO300005746	Later, Shorty.
FO300005747	All right, I'll just be here doing grown-up stuff.
FO300005748	See you, Sticky.
FO300005749	Be careful out there. You don't want to end up on that table in Red's clinic.
FO300005750	I'll be going.
FO300005751	Don't be distracted by the size. Stay calm; shoot straight.
FO300005752	All right. I'm going to get going.
FO300005753	Don't keep me waiting.
FO300005754	I'd better start hunting the next one on the list.
FO300005755	No way. Not on my watch. GUARDS!
FO300005756	Come back if you need something. Not like I'm going anywhere.
FO300005757	Y'all come back real soon.
FO300005758	I'll tell Mr. Eulogy that we talked.
FO300005759	You'd better go before he sees you.
FO300005760	Yeah. Come back when you've got more injuries. And some more caps.
FO300005761	Paradise Falls is here if you need it.
FO300005762	<belches>
FO300005763	Yeah, just behave yourself. The boys up there don't fuck around.
FO300005764	Go, then.
FO300005765	Please... if you get to Underworld, let them know that I'm okay.
FO300005766	Hey, man. Come back any time.
FO300005767	Told you: there's nothing exciting down here.
FO300005768	It's only a matter of time now.
FO300005769	Come back when you are ready to drink, little man.
FO300005770	Come back when you are ready to drink, little girl.
FO300005771	Thanks. Hopefully, it'll just be skinned knees and bloody noses, today.
FO300005772	I'll let you get back to work.
FO300005773	Don't get too hurt out there.
FO300005774	Come back anytime you'd like to sit in.
FO300005775	I'll stop interrupting your class, now.
FO300005776	Stay sharp!
FO300005777	About time, man. This mold isn't getting any tastier.
FO300005778	I'll let you get back to the food.
FO300005779	Keep an eye out.
FO300005780	Bye-bye, Vault Dweller!
FO300005781	Bye-bye, Bumble.
FO300005782	Bye-bye, Mungo!
FO300005783	Bye-bye, Bumble.
FO300005784	Bye-bye!
FO300005785	Bye-bye, Bumble.
FO300005786	Oh, thank goodness you gave me permission. Jerk.
FO300005787	I'm leaving. Get back to guarding.
FO300005788	About time.
FO300005789	Come on back when you've got more stuff to trade!
FO300005790	That's all for me.
FO300005791	See ya around!
FO300005792	See ya about!
FO300005793	Okay, see you next time, mister!
FO300005794	I'm going away. You stay here. Away from me.
FO300005795	Okay, see you next time, miss!
FO300005796	I'm going away. You stay here. Away from me.
FO300005797	Okay, see you next time, bye bye!
FO300005798	I'm going away. You stay here. Away from me.
FO300005799	Bye!
FO300005800	Bye, Penny.
FO300005801	Okay.
FO300005802	Stay cool, Sammy.
FO300005803	I'll try!
FO300005804	Take care, Squirrel.
FO300005805	Bye, then!
FO300005806	Well then, see you later, Lucy.
FO300005807	See you around, MacCready.
FO300005808	Yeah, fine, scram.
FO300005809	See you around, MacCready.
FO300005810	Yeah, sure, whatever.
FO300005811	See you around, MacCready.
FO300005812	Yeah, that's nice, scram.
FO300005813	See you around, MacCready.
FO300005814	Just fucking go, okay?
FO300005815	See you around, MacCready.
FO300005816	Not for a while, I hope.
FO300005817	See you around, MacCready.
FO300005818	Don't let the door hit you on the way out, mungo.
FO300005819	See you around, MacCready.
FO300005820	Not if I shoot you first, you won't.
FO300005821	See you around, MacCready.
FO300005822	Bye-bye!
FO300005823	All right, bye.
FO300005824	Okay, bye bye!
FO300005825	Later.
FO300005826	Hail.
FO300005827	Try and be more careful about when you sneak up on people.
FO300005828	Walk in steel.
FO300005829	Stick to the shadows.
FO300005830	Remember: One shot. One kill.
FO300005831	Move silently.
FO300005832	If you'll excuse me, I need to go show these fish how to shoot straight.
FO300005833	Back to it.
FO300005834	And so we part.
FO300005835	Hooah, soldier.
FO300005836	Stay safe, stranger.
FO300005837	Stand strong.
FO300005838	Never back down.
FO300005839	Strength in Steel, friend.
FO300005840	Unit deactivating. This troop is hitting the rack!
FO300005841	Back to work.
FO300005842	Farewell.
FO300005843	Until next time.
FO300005844	In the Elder's name.
FO300005845	Go with peace and knowledge.
FO300005846	I look forward to our next meeting.
FO300005847	Don't hurry back.
FO300005848	And so you go.
FO300005849	In my father's name, I bid you farewell.
FO300005850	Stay strong.
FO300005851	Very well.
FO300005852	May we speak again soon.
FO300005853	Very well.
FO300005854	Steel walk with you.
FO300005855	Of course.
FO300005856	Steel be with you.
FO300005857	Brotherhood of Steel forever, man!
FO300005858	Don't cause any trouble.
FO300005859	Mind yourself, now.
FO300005860	Right-o. Run along now.
FO300005861	Good day.
FO300005862	Cheerio.
FO300005863	Goodbye.
FO300005864	Yeah, best get on your way.
FO300005865	Give 'em hell!
FO300005866	Get going.
FO300005867	Oh. Okay then. Have a nice one.
FO300005868	Stay out of trouble.
FO300005869	Be good.
FO300005870	Take care!
FO300005871	Don't do anything I wouldn't do!
FO300005872	Take no prisoners!
FO300005873	Good luck.
FO300005874	Go live your life, kid.
FO300005875	Live it up while it lasts.
FO300005876	Parting is such sweet sorrow
FO300005877	Bu-bye!
FO300005878	There's no helping some people, is there?
FO300005879	Ta-ta!
FO300005880	I still got my eye on you.
FO300005881	Watch yourself.
FO300005882	Don't do anything stupid.
FO300005883	Don't get hurt out here.
FO300005884	Try not to break anything important.
FO300005885	Remember: Just say no to drugs. Unless I prescribe them.
FO300005886	Nice chit-chatting with you.
FO300005887	Goodbye.
FO300005888	Farewell.
FO300005889	Go get 'em!
FO300005890	Go make a name for yourself!
FO300005891	Don't forget to have a little fun out there!
FO300005892	Later comrade.
FO300005893	Until next time, comrade.
FO300005894	Good travels to you, comrade.
FO300005895	Charming!
FO300005896	Pleasant day to you, dear.
FO300005897	Until next we meet!
FO300005898	Have a good one!
FO300005899	Don't be a stranger to the cafe!
FO300005900	Bon appetite!
FO300005901	Right on!
FO300005902	Cheers!
FO300005903	You're a real charmer!
FO300005904	Don't be a stranger.
FO300005905	Bye, dear.
FO300005906	Later, then.
FO300005907	Yeah, goodbye.
FO300005908	Sure. See ya.
FO300005909	Oh, all right. See you!
FO300005910	Take care!
FO300005911	Bye now!
FO300005912	Cheers.
FO300005913	I'm afraid I can't stop and chit chat.
FO300005914	Well, I suppose that's goodbye then. Come again anytime.
FO300005915	Thank you for coming to Gary's Galley.
FO300005916	I'd better get going, Angela.
FO300005917	Then go.
FO300005918	Um... I guess I'll be going.
FO300005919	Come back soon.
FO300005920	It's been a pleasure, Mr. Bannon.
FO300005921	I'll be right here when you get thirsty.
FO300005922	Later, Belle.
FO300005923	You know where to find me.
FO300005924	I've got to go.
FO300005925	Don't let the door hit you on the ass.
FO300005926	I think I'll leave now, Brock.
FO300005927	Goodbye.
FO300005928	Thank you for your help, Christie.
FO300005929	I'm sure you'll be back soon.
FO300005930	It's time for me to leave, Cindy.
FO300005931	Bye.
FO300005932	So long C.J.
FO300005933	Duty calls.
FO300005934	You've been very helpful.
FO300005935	Later, dude.
FO300005936	See you later, Ted.
FO300005937	God bless you.
FO300005938	Goodbye, Diego.
FO300005939	Yes, yes. I have things to do too.
FO300005940	I should go.
FO300005941	Take care of yourself.
FO300005942	Bye, Doc.
FO300005943	Saint Monica bless you.
FO300005944	I need to go, Father Clifford.
FO300005945	If you need more ammo, this is where to get it.
FO300005946	I've got to run.
FO300005947	Thank you for coming to Gary's Galley.
FO300005948	I should let you get back to your customers, Gary.
FO300005949	And I have work to do.
FO300005950	I have to leave.
FO300005951	Carry on, then.
FO300005952	Thanks for the help.
FO300005953	Nice talking to you.
FO300005954	Goodbye, Henry.
FO300005955	Whatever.
FO300005956	I gotta run. Stay out of trouble, James.
FO300005957	So long.
FO300005958	Farewell.
FO300005959	Farewell.
FO300005960	So long.
FO300005961	I'll just stay here. Alone.
FO300005962	I have to leave now.
FO300005963	Yeah. Me too.
FO300005964	I've got to run, Paulie.
FO300005965	Next time be more careful. I don't want to accidentally shoot you.
FO300005966	I'm going to go now. Sorry I woke you, Paulie.
FO300005967	Don't let your guard down.
FO300005968	Yes, sir.
FO300005969	That's all for now.
FO300005970	Yes, ma'am.
FO300005971	That's all for now.
FO300005972	See you later.
FO300005973	I should leave.
FO300005974	Come back soon. We've always got a lot of ammo in stock.
FO300005975	Time for me to go.
FO300005976	So do I.
FO300005977	I've got things to do.
FO300005978	Like I care.
FO300005979	Take care, Tammy.
FO300005980	Your loss, sugar. Come see me again sometime.
FO300005981	I hate to do this, but I have to go.
FO300005982	Don't let me stop you.
FO300005983	I'd better leave, Trinnie.
FO300005984	Farewell.
FO300005985	So long, Vera.
FO300005986	So long.
FO300005987	I've got business elsewhere.
FO300005988	Thank you, Janice.
FO300005989	Farewell.
FO300005990	Don't fool around with that bomb unless you know what you're doing.
FO300005991	Good luck. Careful around that bomb.
FO300005992	Time is wasting.
FO300005993	You'll live just long enough to regret your error in judgment.
FO300005994	Bye.
FO300005995	Keep up the good work, son.
FO300005996	Keep up the good work, honey.
FO300005997	I'll see you when you get back.
FO300005998	Good luck, son.
FO300005999	Good luck, honey.
FO300006000	Be careful, okay?
FO300006001	Good luck.
FO300006002	Keep your hands to yourself in here. This equipment is fragile.
FO300006003	Just stay out of my way, okay?
FO300006004	Be careful, sweetie.
FO300006005	I have to go, Dad.
FO300006006	Be careful, son.
FO300006007	I have to go, Dad.
FO300006008	Do it! Detonate the bomb and together we'll usher in a new age of prosperity!
FO300006009	Goodbye.
FO300006010	Whatever. I need to get back to work.
FO300006011	Talk to you later, Andy.
FO300006012	Yeah, catch you later.
FO300006013	Talk to you later, Andy.
FO300006014	Whatever.
FO300006015	Talk to you later, Andy.
FO300006016	Later, gator.
FO300006017	Easy, man.
FO300006018	Catch you later.
FO300006019	Careful in D.C. now. Those Super-Mutants can be a prickly bunch. Heh heh heh heh heh.
FO300006020	Now, get the fuck out of my face.
FO300006021	And so now we part.
FO300006022	Don't let me keep you.
FO300006023	I await our next meeting with bated breath.
FO300006024	I wish you well on your path.
FO300006025	Walk in the Glow.
FO300006026	Rays shower you, child.
FO300006027	Try to be careful.
FO300006028	Yeah. Bye.
FO300006029	Try not to hurt yourself.
FO300006030	See you soon!
FO300006031	Goodbye, Gob.
FO300006032	Come back soon.
FO300006033	Goodbye, Gob.
FO300006034	Don't hit me!
FO300006035	Goodbye, Gob.
FO300006036	Sorry!
FO300006037	Good luck finding your dad.
FO300006038	Come back if you need something.
FO300006039	Have a good one, stranger.
FO300006040	Remember us if you need something!
FO300006041	Are we finished now? Good.
FO300006042	Yeah, whatever.
FO300006043	Whatever you say, kid.
FO300006044	See ya!
FO300006045	Come back soon!
FO300006046	Remember: I'll buy whatever you're selling!
FO300006047	Talk to you later, buddy.
FO300006048	Anytime.
FO300006049	See you soon!
FO300006050	Have a good one.
FO300006051	Carry on.
FO300006052	Mind your manners, now.
FO300006053	See y'all later.
FO300006054	Bye, mister!
FO300006055	Bye, lady!
FO300006056	Come back if you need something, honey.
FO300006057	It's been nice.
FO300006058	Send Nathan home if you see him.
FO300006059	Walk in the Glow.
FO300006060	Atom's light be with you, sweet child.
FO300006061	Farewell, sweet child.
FO300006062	Take care.
FO300006063	God bless The Enclave.
FO300006064	Take care of yourself, hon.
FO300006065	Gotcha.
FO300006066	Well, back to work.
FO300006067	Yeah.
FO300006068	Later.
FO300006069	Goodbye.
FO300006070	Goodbye.
FO300006071	I'll expect to see you in class, Freddie. No excuses. Run along now, son.
FO300006072	Whatever you say, Mr. Brotch.
FO300006073	Idle Chatter
FO300006074	Don't get me wrong, I love to cause trouble, but you go too far.
FO300006075	<bored grunt>
FO300006076	You've changed. I mean, bad is one thing. Evil is another.
FO300006077	Did you really have to kill all of those people back there? They didn't seem so bad.
FO300006078	I always knew that you were a teacher's pet.
FO300006079	This do-gooder crap is for the birds.
FO300006080	Man, you're just a little goody two-shoes, aren't you?
FO300006081	It's so bright out here.
FO300006082	Let's get inside. I hate it out here.
FO300006083	Man. That creeps me out. That thing up there. You know, the sky.
FO300006084	You're not gonna leave me here, are you?
FO300006085	Let's head to that place in Rivet City for a drink.
FO300006086	Being sober really sucks.
FO300006087	Can we rest or something?
FO300006088	<coughs> How do people breathe out here?
FO300006089	Man, I'm all itchy.
FO300006090	What if someone's following us?
FO300006091	Do you even know where you're going?
FO300006092	Are you going the right way?
FO300006093	This place gives me the creeps.
FO300006094	Whew. Man, it stinks.
FO300006095	I heard that there were dragons out here. You ever see one?
FO300006096	You wanna get out of here?
FO300006097	What was that noise?
FO300006098	Hey! Did you hear that?
FO300006099	Man, it stinks. The vault never smelled like this.
FO300006100	Be careful.
FO300006101	This place is not safe.
FO300006102	There may be danger here.
FO300006103	<grumbles>
FO300006104	<grumbles>
FO300006105	Be cautious.
FO300006106	Aww, aren't you cute?
FO300006107	Can I have a better gun?
FO300006108	<yawns>
FO300006109	This place sucks.
FO300006110	I'm bored.
FO300006111	There's not a lot of cash in bein' good, you know.
FO300006112	I didn't sign on with you so that we could be playing Santa Claus out here.
FO300006113	What's goin' on here, kid? I thought you were some sort of badass.
FO300006114	Goddamn cigarettes are getting' harder to find.
FO300006115	Why's everything all blurry?
FO300006116	I could use a smoke.
FO300006117	<coughs>
FO300006118	<coughs>
FO300006119	I forgot how fucked up everything was out here.
FO300006120	Man, I'm glad to finally be away from Megaton.
FO300006121	It's good to be out here again. Damn good.
FO300006122	C'mon. Let's get moving.
FO300006123	I think I've been here before.
FO300006124	Too much open space out here. I don't like it.
FO300006125	Up there. That's a good fuckin' spot for a sniper. Keep an eye out.
FO300006126	I hope this place stays standin' long enough for us to leave.
FO300006127	This floor don't look stable.
FO300006128	Man, it stinks in here.
FO300006129	It saddens me to see you behaving in this manner, my friend.
FO300006130	The path of right action is the way of truth. Perhaps you need a reminder of this.
FO300006131	You have strayed from your path, my friend.
FO300006132	There is reason to be cautious here.
FO300006133	Be aware of our surroundings.
FO300006134	Though we may seem safe for the moment, it is fleeting.
FO300006135	There is safety in mindfulness.
FO300006136	Be aware of the present moment.
FO300006137	We should be mindful.
FO300006138	In all things, the calm heart must prevail.
FO300006139	I'm here, at your back.
FO300006140	Our steps must be measured.
FO300006141	There are times that I feel the primal part of me pulling me away.
FO300006142	We must walk softly.
FO300006143	It's amazing that people trust you enough not to attack me.
FO300006144	I'm concerned about this area.
FO300006145	Sir, searching for targets.
FO300006146	Sir, I am on the lookout.
FO300006147	Your actions have become disturbing to me.
FO300006148	This is a dangerous game that you play.
FO300006149	We all stray from our path from time to time. I trust that you will return to yours. Soon.
FO300006150	Make no mistake. Your father would be proud of what you've done.
FO300006151	Your father would be proud of you.
FO300006152	You are a credit to your father.
FO300006153	You're on point. I shall back you up.

FO300006159	Is this relevant to the mission?
FO300006160	Vigilance is advised.
FO300006161	Be vigilant.
FO300006162	Huh?
FO300006163	Rusty old pipe! A fresh coat of paint is just what you need!
FO300006164	That should just about do it.
FO300006165	There are no dishes in this house. Please go out and purchase more.
FO300006166	Laundry is dirty and unfolded. Please purchase a washing machine and ironing board.

FO300006168	Damn, machine. Stop floating there and get moving!
FO300006169	You don't want to be the first class in history to fail the G.O.A.T., do you?
FO300006170	Take your seats so we can get started.
FO300006171	Come on, people. Find your seats.
FO300006172	Let's not keep the Overseer waiting.
FO300006173	Come on, Freddie! Finish up already.
FO300006174	Please no more roaches.
FO300006175	Lights'll be back on in a few more minutes. Few more minutes.
FO300006176	What the hell has gotten into the Overseer?
FO300006177	You won't see the Overseer out on roach patrol.
FO300006178	I can't believe the Doc went out there. Rather shoot myself in the head.
FO300006179	Damn that troublemaking doctor.
FO300006180	It's all the Doc's fault. He never should have opened the door.
FO300006181	I knew we should've never let him in. Said so at the time.
FO300006182	Oh my God. Oh my God.
FO300006183	Please, no more. No more no more no more.
FO300006184	Got to get a grip on yourself, Gloria. Get a grip.
FO300006185	Freddie, do you understand what "pencils down" means?
FO300006186	Freddie, it's multiple choice. You can't really still be thinking about it.
FO300006187	I don't have all day, Freddie. The Overseer's waiting for these.
FO300006188	Help! Bomb!
FO300006189	Help me!
FO300006190	My God, it's about to go off!
FO300006191	What's the word? Heard anything interesting?
FO300006192	Mabel sure does make some wonderful pies. She's a great cook.
FO300006193	Oh, I was just looking at the new RobCo catalog. Some impressive things they're doing these days.
FO300006194	I was thinking of having a cookout soon, since the weather has been so wonderful.
FO300006195	Sure is a beautiful day today.
FO300006196	Nothing like the smell of apple pie, is there? I can't get enough of it.
FO300006197	Attack

FO300006217	First that crazy simulation, now this. Has the entire world taken leave of its senses?
FO300006218	Traveling the Wasteland, shooting guns! By God, I'm getting too old for this sort of thing!
FO300006219	Damnit, just leave us alone!

FO300006232	This is surprisingly satisfying.

FO300006513	I'm just getting warmed up! Hoo-ah!
FO300006514	There's nothing I like better than the smell of plasma in the morning!
FO300006515	What's the matter, you pansy ass pinko? Getting tired?
FO300006516	We are lean! We are mean!
FO300006517	I have a personal message for you from Uncle Sam!
FO300006518	Running will only make the pain last longer!
FO300006519	Kill them all! God will understand.
FO300006520	There's nothing I like better than making some other poor bastard die for his country.
FO300006521	Now you're starting to piss me off.
FO300006522	*Sigh.* Why must you humans always resort to violence?
FO300006523	Do stand still!
FO300006524	And who gets to clean up all this blood? Me, that's who...
FO300006525	Oohh. Yesss... Let's all beat up on the robot...
FO300006526	By God, if I had hands I would strangle the life out of you!
FO300006527	Have at thee!
FO300006528	For Queen and country!
FO300006529	You have insulted my honor, and for that, you must die!
FO300006530	Human!
FO300006531	I am in control here.
FO300006532	You disappoint me.
FO300006533	You've brought this on yourself.
FO300006534	Watch your fire! Don't hit the merchandise!
FO300006535	What do I pay you people for? Take 'em down!
FO300006536	I want her head on a platter!
FO300006537	I want his head on a platter!
FO300006538	Forward, brothers!
FO300006539	For the Brotherhood!
FO300006540	Vargas, Reddin! Spread out and flank 'em!
FO300006541	Colvin! I want fire on that target now!
FO300006542	I want those targets down now!
FO300006543	Oh, a tough guy, huh?
FO300006544	I got another one just like that in my other hand.
FO300006545	Teach you to mess with the Tunnel Snakes!
FO300006546	Had enough yet?
FO300006547	Come on!
FO300006548	Oh yeah.
FO300006549	Get him, guys!
FO300006550	Get her, guys!
FO300006551	How do you like that, Poindexter?
FO300006552	Maybe this time the lesson will stick.
FO300006553	Did you see that, Butch? I nailed him a good one!
FO300006554	I can't believe I'm hitting a girl.
FO300006555	Tunnel Snakes rule, losers drool!
FO300006556	Watch your spacing!
FO300006557	Concentrate your fire!
FO300006558	By the numbers, Pride! Short, controlled bursts!
FO300006559	Keep firing! They bleed just like anything else!
FO300006560	I'm gonna rip you up, clown shoes!
FO300006561	Die, mother fucker!
FO300006562	Tunnel Snakes rule!
FO300006563	Tunnel Snakes for life!
FO300006564	Oh yeah, we so rule!
FO300006565	Sit on it!
FO300006566	Rock and roll!
FO300006567	You suckers are so screwed!
FO300006568	Yeah, eat it!
FO300006569	Rumble!
FO300006570	Who's your daddy?
FO300006571	Yeah, how you like it?
FO300006572	Go run home to mommy!
FO300006573	You're pathetic!
FO300006574	Give up now, if you know what's good for you!
FO300006575	You don't even know how screwed you are!
FO300006576	No one messes with the Tunnel Snakes!
FO300006577	Yeah!
FO300006578	How you like me now?
FO300006579	Aw, yeah!
FO300006580	Hope you weren't thinking of being a model, pal.
FO300006581	Tough luck, pal!
FO300006582	Time for a beating!
FO300006583	Have at you!
FO300006584	Take this! And this!
FO300006585	Science always triumphs!
FO300006586	Fuck you!
FO300006587	Rarg!
FO300006588	Ha ha ha ha!
FO300006589	YARRRRRRG!
FO300006590	Goddammit, I love violence!
FO300006591	Die! Die! Fuckin' die!
FO300006592	Die!
FO300006593	Is that the best you got?
FO300006594	Don't you bleed on me!
FO300006595	Oh, I can't wait to see you bleed out!
FO300006596	Man, I missed this shit!
FO300006597	Hell yeah! Ha ha ha!
FO300006598	It's good to be back!
FO300006599	You are so dead.
FO300006600	Goddamn, aren't you dead yet?
FO300006601	You're going down.
FO300006602	I really missed this.
FO300006603	Yeah! Yeah!
FO300006604	Charon! Stop her!
FO300006605	Charon! Stop him!
FO300006606	Charon! Kill!
FO300006607	It's time for you to be going.
FO300006608	I hate scrubbing blood out of the floors.
FO300006609	I never should've let you on this damn boat!
FO300006610	Everyone's so goddamn trigger happy these days.
FO300006611	You've left me no choice.
FO300006612	Damnit!
FO300006613	Security! Need some help over here!
FO300006614	Stand down!
FO300006615	Do you WANT to die?!
FO300006616	Stupid!
FO300006617	Goddamn moron!
FO300006618	This whole scene is crazy!
FO300006619	We are so the baddest gang in the Wastes.
FO300006620	Man, sure beats living in the Vault, huh?
FO300006621	Least I'm not stuck being a barber anymore.
FO300006622	Any moment now, you'll be dead. Are you excited to see what that's like?
FO300006623	You like that?
FO300006624	Get the hell out of my town!
FO300006625	I hate wasting ammo on idiots.
FO300006626	Had enough?
FO300006627	I do enjoy a good row!
FO300006628	Ha ha! Take that!
FO300006629	What fun!
FO300006630	Just get away from me!
FO300006631	Stay back!
FO300006632	Leave me alone!
FO300006633	God damn runaway!
FO300006634	Kill the slaves!
FO300006635	I'll see you dead or in chains!
FO300006636	Freedom!

FO300006638	Goddamn slaver!
FO300006639	Need some help with this one!
FO300006640	Did I hit him?
FO300006641	Take him down!
FO300006642	Keep them pinned!
FO300006643	You'll never take me alive!
FO300006644	Come and get it if you want it!
FO300006645	It's all a terrible mistake.
FO300006646	I'm so sorry.
FO300006647	This world makes no sense to me.
FO300006648	Why is there so much suffering?
FO300006649	I will always remember you.
FO300006650	Maybe this time it will be different.
FO300006651	Is life just a cruel illusion?
FO300006652	Yeah?! Yeah?! You want some of this?
FO300006653	Batter up!
FO300006654	Huargh!
FO300006655	Ggrrrr!

FO300006658	That's it, that's it.
FO300006659	What's the matter, huh? Can't stand the sight of your own blood?
FO300006660	Damn it!
FO300006661	There's more where that came from.
FO300006662	Yeah! Yeah!
FO300006663	Bring it!
FO300006664	Had enough?
FO300006665	Yeah!
FO300006666	You like that, you bastard?
FO300006667	Want some more?
FO300006668	Steady!
FO300006669	Don't let them get away!
FO300006670	Aggghhh!
FO300006671	Stop moving around so much!
FO300006672	Hold still, meat.
FO300006673	Die! Die! Diiiieee!!
FO300006674	The right to bear arms shall never be infringed!
FO300006675	You'll never take me alive!
FO300006676	You'll be sorry you messed with Laszlo Radford!
FO300006677	Die commie scum!
FO300006678	Mr. Burke says goodnight!
FO300006679	You should have followed Burke's orders!
FO300006680	You blew up Megaton, you fucker!
FO300006681	This is for Megaton!
FO300006682	I had family in Megaton!
FO300006683	You need to learn some manners!
FO300006684	I'm gonna beat you up!
FO300006685	You're gonna get it now!
FO300006686	I'm going to teach you a lesson you won't forget!

FO300006693	Filthy little monsters!
FO300006694	God, I hate these things!
FO300006695	Get away from me!
FO300006696	You shouldn't have tried to run.
FO300006697	Your father betrayed us all!
FO300006698	You didn't really think you could get away from us, did you?
FO300006699	I knew we would find you eventually.
FO300006700	Overseer's orders, I'm afraid.
FO300006701	The punishment for treason is death.
FO300006702	Too bad it had to end this way. But orders are orders.
FO300006703	You know, I liked your dad. I guess he had us all fooled.
FO300006704	I'll try to make this as painless as possible.
FO300006705	Don't make this more difficult than it has to be.
FO300006706	I've been wanting to do this for a long time, you little punk.
FO300006707	If he let me beat up Amata, just imagine what he'll let me do to you.
FO300006708	Jonas cried while we beat him, did you know that?
FO300006709	Hold still and take it like a man.
FO300006710	Come and get it, you dirty traitor!
FO300006711	Why'd you have to go and attack me? Now I have no choice.
FO300006712	I would have let you go, you know. I always liked you.
FO300006713	Run for it, miss!
FO300006714	Run for it, son!
FO300006715	You don't have to do this.
FO300006716	You're no better than your father.
FO300006717	I always knew it would come to this.
FO300006718	How dare you threaten me?
FO300006719	Your father was a traitor and a coward!
FO300006720	Guards! Help me!
FO300006721	Off with you now!
FO300006722	That’s it! Back to your vile little hidey holes!
FO300006723	Get back!

FO300007122	Thief!
FO300007123	I'd recommend putting that down.
FO300007124	Alarm! We're being robbed!

FO300007146	Here's how we deal with robbers in Little Lamplight.
FO300007147	You got a lot of nerve, coming in here and trying to rob us.

FO300007212	There's a reason why we don't let mungos in here.
FO300007213	Thought I wouldn't notice your fat fingers going through my pockets?
FO300007214	You think you can just come in here and take my stuff?
FO300007215	You dirty sneak! Give me that back!

FO300008107	That takes care of that.
FO300008108	You won't be bothering anybody again.
FO300008109	Teach you to mess with me.
FO300008110	What a mess.
FO300008111	Whew!
FO300008112	That could have been a lot worse.
FO300008113	I'm glad that's over.
FO300008114	That was unfortunate.
FO300008115	I didn't think I'd get out of that alive.
FO300008116	That was crazy!
FO300008117	What's the world coming to?
FO300008118	Man, I was getting revved too.
FO300008119	Did you see that shit?
FO300008120	I am the best.
FO300008121	And that's how we do things round our way.
FO300008122	Bah. That wasn't even a fight.
FO300008123	That was over too soon.
FO300008124	Sometimes, it's just too easy.
FO300008125	That was fun!
FO300008126	Dibs on the loot.
FO300008127	Ha ha! Kick ass.
FO300008128	Like shootin' fish in a barrel.
FO300008129	Another one bites the dust.
FO300008130	Too fuckin' easy.
FO300008131	That's how it's done, boys.
FO300008132	Threat analysis: green. Neutralization operation complete.
FO300008133	Threat analysis: green. Security operation successful. Resuming normal operation.
FO300008134	Hostiles neutralized. Recommend immediate repairs to primary systems to ensure continued operation.
FO300008135	I'm glad that's over.
FO300008136	I'm sorry it had to end this way.
FO300008137	I'll always remember you. My memory circuits have almost unlimited capacity.
FO300008138	Attention citizens. You may now resume your normal activities.
FO300008139	Law and order has prevailed.
FO300008140	A little peace and quiet, at last.
FO300008141	Well, that's it then.
FO300008142	That's enough excitement for one day.
FO300008143	That's how we do things in the U.S. army! Hoo-ah!
FO300008144	Time to hit the showers!
FO300008145	Another glorious day in the U.S. army!
FO300008146	I don't have time for this nonsense.
FO300008147	That takes cawe of that.
FO300008148	Whoa, that was intense.
FO300008149	You mess with the Tunnel Snake, and you get the fangs! Yeah!
FO300008150	That's how we do it! Woo!
FO300008151	Sucker didn't know who he was messing with! Hah!
FO300008152	That takes care of that.
FO300008153	I win again!
FO300008154	You lose!
FO300008155	Okay, who's next?!
FO300008156	That takes care of that.
FO300008157	Teach you to mess with me.
FO300008158	Good enough.
FO300008159	Well, that's the end of that.
FO300008160	Glad that's over.
FO300008161	Phew. I'm glad that's over.
FO300008162	What? Is it over?
FO300008163	Oh my God. I can't believe that just happened.
FO300008164	<whimpering>
FO300008165	Enemy down!
FO300008166	All clear. Stand down.
FO300008167	One more for the Brotherhood.
FO300008168	Victory!
FO300008169	Sound the all clear.
FO300008170	Area secured.
FO300008171	CombatToLost
FO300008172	Damn it, where'd it go?
FO300008173	Sneaky fuckers, aren't they?
FO300008174	It's got to be here somewhere.
FO300008175	I think it's gone somewhere else!
FO300008176	Where'd it go?
FO300008177	It's behind me, isn't it?
FO300008178	Dammit, lost them. Check back in B Ring.
FO300008179	Zero contact, no kill. Send a team to the Lab. Protect the robot!
FO300008180	Where'd they go? Check inside!
FO300008181	Damn. Contact lost. Repeat, contact lost.
FO300008182	Stay alert, Brothers.
FO300008183	Am I too much for you to handle?
FO300008184	Didn't think a Ghoul could kick your ass?
FO300008185	Come back here! I wasn't done with you yet!
FO300008186	Go ahead and hide. I like a good chase.
FO300008187	What fun! A game of hide and seek!
FO300008188	Lost sight of target.
FO300008189	Disappeared? Clever.
FO300008190	It's not over until you lie dead!
FO300008191	Come back and fight me!
FO300008192	Your cowardice astounds me!
FO300008193	Lost target tracking!
FO300008194	Target lost! Attempting to reacquire.
FO300008195	Enemy out of visual range. Commence sweep.
FO300008196	Negative visual on tango.
FO300008197	Enemy has disengaged and is no longer in sight.
FO300008198	Reporting target has evaded detection.
FO300008199	Hey! Come back and fight!
FO300008200	What a coward.
FO300008201	Playin' tricks, huh?
FO300008202	Leaving so soon?
FO300008203	Playing games with me, huh?
FO300008204	Holy shit! The fucker disappeared!
FO300008205	Where'd that little fucker go?
FO300008206	Where'd that little bitch go?
FO300008207	Awww man, come back! I was havin' fun!
FO300008208	Shit! Lost 'em!
FO300008209	Alert. Target lock lost. Beginning search pattern delta seven.
FO300008210	Alert. Target lock lost. Neutralization by lethal force remains primary objective.
FO300008211	Alert. Target lock lost. Unneutralized hostile within perimeter.
FO300008212	Where did you go? Was it something I said?
FO300008213	I'm coming to find you now. I'm afraid my programming does not allow me to let you get away.
FO300008214	You're behaving very rudely. I wouldn't hide from you, if our positions were reversed.
FO300008215	Do not attempt to flee. You will be identified and sanctioned.
FO300008216	Fugitive is attempting to evade capture. Beginning pursuit.
FO300008217	Initiating search for hostile target.
FO300008218	Just what I was hoping for. Trundling around looking for something that wants to blow me to flinders.
FO300008219	Must we play hide and seek now?
FO300008220	Ready or not, here I come!
FO300008221	That's a good start. Now just keep running and we'll call it even.
FO300008222	Somebody find me something to shoot at!
FO300008223	Who's got a target?
FO300008224	Restore contact with the enemy, goddammit!
FO300008225	So you want to play hide and seek, eh?
FO300008226	Your prowess at hiding is impressive!
FO300008227	Go ahead and hide like the rat you are.
FO300008228	Oh goodie. Hide and seek. I haven't played this game in years.
FO300008229	You can't hide forever. You're stink will eventually give you away.
FO300008230	I do so enjoy a good hunt!
FO300008231	Quit hiding and come out and fight!
FO300008232	Come out here, you sissy! Finish what you started!
FO300008233	I'll find you, and then you'll be sorry!
FO300008234	Is that really necessary? I won't hurt you. Come out of there and let's discuss this civilly.
FO300008235	Come now. You're being unsporting.
FO300008236	I'm growing tired of this little game of ours. Show yourself!
FO300008237	Where'd you go?
FO300008238	Hey! You disappear! No fair!
FO300008239	Ha ha! Go ahead and hide little bleeder!
FO300008240	Gone! Spineless human!
FO300008241	What? Did I scare you that easy? Ha ha!
FO300008242	Holy shit! A Stealth Boy!
FO300008243	A Stealth Boy! Damn it!
FO300008244	Damn it. Where'd he go?
FO300008245	Let me go take a look around.
FO300008246	I bet I know where you went.
FO300008247	Anybody see anything?
FO300008248	Split up and search the area.
FO300008249	Where'd you go?
FO300008250	Watch the tunnel entrances.
FO300008251	Is it safe now?
FO300008252	This can't be happening. This just can't be happening.
FO300008253	I've got no targets.
FO300008254	Anybody got anything?
FO300008255	Contact lost. Initiating search pattern.
FO300008256	Sweep the area.
FO300008257	I have no hostiles.
FO300008258	Lost 'em!
FO300008259	LostToNormal
FO300008260	That zombie will be back. I just know it.
FO300008261	I think it's gone somewhere else!
FO300008262	Where'd it go?
FO300008263	It's behind me, isn't it?
FO300008264	Cleared out, I guess.
FO300008265	Go tell your friends you got whooped by a Ghoul!
FO300008266	Run away to suck at your mommy's tit? Go on get out of here!
FO300008267	Ha ha! You keep running!
FO300008268	Chicken shit!
FO300008269	Can't handle the old Daring Dashwood, eh? Can't say I blame you!
FO300008270	Buggered off, eh? Fine. I was done playing with you anyway.
FO300008271	Must've given up.
FO300008272	That's right! Don't mess with me!
FO300008273	I'm sure our paths will cross again.
FO300008274	Then we both live to fight another day.
FO300008275	Reporting enemy has escaped.
FO300008276	Cancel alarm.
FO300008277	Target has escaped.
FO300008278	Resume normal procedures.
FO300008279	Enemy has evaded detection. Standing down.
FO300008280	Contact with tango lost.
FO300008281	I don't know where he could have gotten to.
FO300008282	I don't know where she could have gotten to.
FO300008283	Doesn't that just beat all.
FO300008284	No matter. We'll find them eventually.
FO300008285	Oh, never mind. They'll turn up sooner or later.
FO300008286	What's the use. Must be long gone by now.
FO300008287	Hmm. Strange. I wonder where they went.
FO300008288	Run off, I guess.
FO300008289	Well, I can't find anything.
FO300008290	Huh. Guess they're gone.
FO300008291	Whew. I was hoping I wouldn't find anything.
FO300008292	Ahhhhh. I lost 'em.
FO300008293	I got better things to do anyway.
FO300008294	I don't have time for this crap.
FO300008295	Crap! They're gone.
FO300008296	Keep on running, chump.
FO300008297	Yeah. Keep runnin'.
FO300008298	Chicken shit.
FO300008299	You better run.
FO300008300	Ha. What a little bitch.
FO300008301	Dumb ass coward.
FO300008302	Shit. Must've scared 'em off.
FO300008303	Threat analysis: green. Perimeter secure. Resuming standard operations.
FO300008304	Threat analysis: green. Perimeter secure.
FO300008305	Threat analysis: green. No hostiles detected.
FO300008306	Oh well. I wish you hadn't left so soon. I was having such a good time with you.
FO300008307	I'll miss you. Please come back and see me again.
FO300008308	I hope I didn't hurt your feelings with all that shooting and flaming. I'm afraid it's just the way I was programmed.
FO300008309	Hostile has escaped. Transmitting description to designated law enforcement authorities.
FO300008310	Fugitive has evaded pursuit. Law enforcement authorities now have primary responsibility for apprehension.
FO300008311	Search complete. No hostiles detected. Standing down.
FO300008312	Typical chickenshit commie maneuver.
FO300008313	The enemy has retired before the awesome might of the U.S. army.
FO300008314	This battlefield now belongs to Uncle Sam!
FO300008315	Hmph. Better get back to my bitches! Ha, ha!
FO300008316	Cleawed out I guess.
FO300008317	Ah well, back to my experiments.
FO300008318	Ah, screw this. Let's have a drink.
FO300008319	Gone now. Pity.
FO300008320	I wanted a fight.
FO300008321	No blood to spill today.
FO300008322	Slippery humans.
FO300008323	Must have bugged out.
FO300008324	Hmm. Oh well.
FO300008325	I can't find anything.
FO300008326	Cleared out, I guess.
FO300008327	Stand down.
FO300008328	I guess we ran 'em off.
FO300008329	Nobody here anymore.
FO300008330	Is it safe now?
FO300008331	This can't be happening. This just can't be happening.
FO300008332	All clear. Stand down.
FO300008333	The area's clear. Must've bugged out.
FO300008334	Looks like they thought better of tangling with the Brotherhood of Steel.
FO300008335	Area is secured. Hostiles have vacated.
FO300008336	Sound the all clear.
FO300008337	Targets lost.
FO300008338	LostToCombat
FO300008339	It's coming this way!
FO300008340	We're all going to die!
FO300008341	Got him!
FO300008342	You can't hide from me, zombie!
FO300008343	Zombie, over there. I see you!
FO300008344	Oh my God!
FO300008345	I have contact. Weapons hot.
FO300008346	Positive contact. Firing.
FO300008347	There you are, outsider!
FO300008348	There is no shelter from the Brotherhood.
FO300008349	The Brotherhood sees all.
FO300008350	Hostile located in the lab!
FO300008351	Found him! In the lab!
FO300008352	Found her! In the lab!
FO300008353	Contact in A Ring! Repeat, I have found the intruder in A Ring!
FO300008354	Positive contact near the Archives!
FO300008355	Can't hide from my keen Ghoul senses!
FO300008356	Ha! Time to die asshole!
FO300008357	Thought you could hide forever?
FO300008358	Death to all defilers of Oasis!
FO300008359	Prepare for your last moments!
FO300008360	You will be destroyed, Outsider!
FO300008361	Alert! Alert! Trespasser detected!
FO300008362	This area is off-limits to non Nuka-Cola personnel!

FO300008371	Intruder Located! Contacting Vault-Tec Security!
FO300008372	Tango reacquired!
FO300008373	Positive ID on lost target acquired!
FO300008374	Reengaging target!
FO300008375	Target found! Firing!
FO300008376	We've got the target!
FO300008377	Target relocated! Engaging!
FO300008378	There you are, you little bastard.
FO300008379	The Overseer said there'd be a bonus for whoever brought you in.
FO300008380	Here he is!
FO300008381	Here she is!
FO300008382	Bingo!
FO300008383	Over here!
FO300008384	Nice try, amateur.
FO300008385	Found your sorry ass!
FO300008386	Playtime's over!
FO300008387	Let's do this.
FO300008388	Reengaging hostile target!
FO300008389	Brotherhood! Over here!
FO300008390	I've got him. Rally on me.
FO300008391	Target locked!
FO300008392	Target acquired!
FO300008393	Found 'em. Engaging!
FO300008394	There you are, you little bitch.
FO300008395	Your time just ran out!
FO300008396	Fuckin' hide from me? You're dead!
FO300008397	Ha! Found your sorry ass!
FO300008398	Thought you could hide?
FO300008399	There you are!
FO300008400	Target lock status: green. Reengaging hostile target.
FO300008401	Hostile target detected. Target lock status: green.
FO300008402	Target lock acquired. Resuming lethal force neutralization operation.
FO300008403	Were you trying to hide from me?
FO300008404	You'll find that my electronic sensors are quite sophisticated.
FO300008405	My search routines are quite advanced, don't you think?
FO300008406	Fugitive has been located. Commencing attack.
FO300008407	Your attempted escape is only making things worse for you.
FO300008408	Do not make any further escape attempts, lawbreaker.
FO300008409	You cannot hide from me, you commie maggot!
FO300008410	You can run, but you can't hide!
FO300008411	Your worthless hide is mine!
FO300008412	Thought hiding would save you?
FO300008413	Aha!
FO300008414	You can't hide from me.
FO300008415	Over here!
FO300008416	There you are!
FO300008417	There you are!
FO300008418	Perhaps you're not the master of stealth you thought you were!
FO300008419	Aha! There you are! That was fun. Pity you'll be dead soon so we can't play again.
FO300008420	Not very clever are you?
FO300008421	And here I was so enjoying our little cat and mouse game. It's a shame I have to kill you now.
FO300008422	Tsk tsk. I had thought you were more clever than that. Oh well.
FO300008423	So are you going to let me kill you now, or are you going to run away again?
FO300008424	There you are. Now, let's finish this nonsense.
FO300008425	Aha! Gotcha!
FO300008426	Nice try!
FO300008427	Can't escape me!
FO300008428	I knew it! I'm gonna tear you apart!
FO300008429	No more hidin' for you!
FO300008430	Ha ha! I found you!
FO300008431	HEEELLLPPP!
FO300008432	Oh no!
FO300008433	Somebody, anybody, help me!
FO300008434	<screaming in fear>
FO300008435	Engaging!
FO300008436	Target acquired, going for a quick kill.
FO300008437	Couldn't hide forever.
FO300008438	On me!
FO300008439	Spotted, over there!
FO300008440	There you are!
FO300008441	Come on. I'm not so bad. There's more you want to tell me, isn't there?
FO300008442	Never mind then.
FO300008443	SpeechChallengeFailure
FO300008444	No, I'm sorry. I will not force her to awaken. I can't predict the effect it may have on her system.
FO300008445	That's just what I would expect to hear from another spy from the Wasteland. You have one hour to leave the Republic of Dave or be executed.
FO300008446	Certain information came to light. I paid a fortune in caps and obtained it.
FO300008447	There really isn't much more to it.
FO300008448	What? Gimme a break.
FO300008449	You know what I think? I think you killed her. That means we've got a problem.
FO300008450	I think it's time to introduce you to a close friend of mine. I call him the Kneecapper. Say hello.
FO300008451	No way, that's more than I was gonna pay Grady. Forget it!
FO300008452	All I'm offering is 200 caps. That's it. Take it or leave it.
FO300008453	Charming. I feel I should tell you that your negotiation skills aren't quite up to par. You wouldn't want to embarrass yourself again.
FO300008454	That's not going to work on me.
FO300008455	I'm not falling for that.
FO300008456	Why the hell should I trust you?
FO300008457	Nope. It's 15 each. You wanna do it or what?
FO300008458	Wrong answer, dead meat!
FO300008459	Her menace may have passed, but I cannot risk the suit falling into another's hands.
FO300008460	The temptation of its power may be too great for others. I couldn't live with myself if it corrupted you, as well.
FO300008461	Perhaps humanity isn't dead yet, but I'll be sure to help it along. Its writhing corpse shall feed my colony well.
FO300008462	Perhaps humanity isn't dead yet, but I'll be sure to help it along. Its writhing corpse shall feed my colony well.
FO300008463	Umm. I just remembered something I need to do. Bye.
FO300008464	I'm afraid that won't do, friend. Are you sure you won't take the generous offer I've already made?
FO300008465	I've got some I keep for myself in case there's an accident or something. Will you shut up about this if I give some to you?
FO300008466	This kind of crap gets around, you know. You try bullying too many people, and it's going to cost you.
FO300008467	Give me the fungus, or I'll seal this place underground. And you with it.
FO300008468	I'd deal with you myself, except these people are going to need someone to watch out for them out there.
FO300008469	The Overseer's insane and thought no one would leave if they all died. <Lie>
FO300008470	No! Those things! They're right behind me! Leave me alone!
FO300008471	Nope! All I got is what's left on my back.
FO300008472	But I digress. If it's payment you need, all I can offer is one of my Mutagenic Bioenhancers.
FO300008473	What kind of nonsense is that? What does science have to do with a religious belief?
FO300008474	Now I ask you again, why did you do such a horrible thing?
FO300008475	If I had a cap for every punk that tried that line on me, I'd be rich.
FO300008476	Nope! Take the tour first. Then we talk about my proposition!
FO300008477	So, you up for it?
FO300008478	Nope, I'm not telling! It's a really cool surprise though. You're gonna love it, I promise!
FO300008479	No, I don't think so. Take what you can get.
FO300008480	They're more like a tradition. Most of them were passed down from this book we found down back, called "Vault Boy's Big Book of Laughs for Kids".
FO300008481	They're not really funny, but something about hearing them is a little comforting, you know?
FO300008482	That was pretty funny! <Lie>
FO300008483	I don't have to take that crap from you! Shut up!
FO300008484	I don't care what you need, this place is off limits and that's that.
FO300008485	It's outsider's perspectives that drove him here in the first place.
FO300008486	Sorry, I can't really help you.
FO300008487	I am afraid that the knowledge required to appreciate our true nature is far above your level of comprehension.
FO300008488	In light of your candor, all I can promise is that Arefu will no longer be a target of the Family. Beyond that, I make no such other promises.
FO300008489	No, it would not be right to disturb him in this time of meditation. I am sorry but I cannot allow it.
FO300008490	Nothing. The Family are just a bunch of damn punks.
FO300008491	No, I'm sorry. I'll never set foot in that place again.
FO300008492	No, I'm sorry. I'll never set foot in that place again.
FO300008493	I'd prefer not to talk about it. Some people wouldn't appreciate my past.
FO300008494	I understand your hesitation, but I can assure you that no harm will befall you.
FO300008495	Sorry, that's only for secrets between friends!
FO300008496	I'm afraid I won't be persuaded. Whatever powers you may have over the average Wastelander are ineffectual on me.
FO300008497	I'm not listening to anything you have to say, prisoner! Stand down at once!
FO300008498	I'm afraid that it just doesn't work that way.
FO300008499	I guess we know where the next meal is coming from!
FO300008500	Your voice stress patterns indicate you are telling a falsehood. This is in violation of Protocol NC-01.
FO300008501	I'm sorry. You have now exceeded 2 demerits. Now instituting Expulsion Protocol KL-001.
FO300008502	I'm sorry, your voice stress patterns indicate you are telling a falsehood. This is in violation of Protocol NC-01.
FO300008503	One demerit will now be issued. Note that further demerits can cause your expulsion from this job posting.
FO300008504	As previously stated, please identify yourself.
FO300008505	I'm not at liberty to say.
FO300008506	I'm not easily manipulated. So don't bother.
FO300008507	I'm sorry. Certain things are best shared between friends.
FO300008508	You have to do better than that. I deal with bigger assholes than you on a daily basis.
FO300008509	Mmm. Let's talk about something else.
FO300008510	That's privileged information.
FO300008511	Sorry. Doctors are trained in confidentiality.
FO300008512	You won't be intimidating me today, sir.
FO300008513	That's none of your business.
FO300008514	You're starting to really annoy me. People usually start dying when I get annoyed.
FO300008515	Um. Yeah. Sorry. Not telling. Change the subject now.
FO300008516	I don't know anything about that.
FO300008517	I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. Sorry.
FO300008518	You'd like to know, wouldn't you? Well, if you knew enough to be trusted, you wouldn't go around asking questions like that. Sorry, kid.
FO300008519	Ummm. Yeah. Sorry. Don't know.
FO300008520	Grownups just can't be trusted with certain types of information. Sorry.
FO300008521	Yeah, I'm afraid that's not going to work with me.
FO300008522	No way. I don't know you well enough.
FO300008523	I'm trained in resisting all forms of coercion. You're wasting your time.
FO300008524	Meh. Not going to tell the likes of you.
FO300008525	You're right. It's probably not safe for me here. But from the sound of the man on that recording, it's not safe for me in the Commonwealth either.
FO300008526	Nice try. I said no.
FO300008527	Seriously. No.
FO300008528	Look, I don't know who you are. I'm not just handing over my life's earnings to you!
FO300008529	I like what you're saying but this is bigger than just you and your dad.
FO300008530	If you want help from Galaxy News, you need to contribute to Galaxy News. That's all there is to it.
FO300008531	There is no way that's happening.
FO300008532	You're lying. I bet you didn't have the guts to kill him.
FO300008533	Right. You're just a lying bigot, like all humans.
FO300008534	No dice.
FO300008535	Is that the best you can do? I'm afraid I'm not impressed.
FO300008536	Not an option, I'm afraid. We aren't exactly rolling in cash, down here.
FO300008537	Penny's one of us. She's gotta come too.
FO300008538	You can't get blood from a stone. I'd love to help you, but first we need to iron out the deal.
FO300008539	So, what do you say?
FO300008540	Oh no no no. That just won't do. 200 Caps is all I'm going to pay.
FO300008541	Sorry friend. You ought keep better track of your loved ones.
FO300008542	Heh. Yeah right. I don't think so.
FO300008543	Yeah, sorry. I don't think so.
FO300008544	Nice try.
FO300008545	Nice try asshole. Pay up or find someone else's time to waste.
FO300008546	Shut up! I'm not listening to you. It's not too late!
FO300008547	You're full of it. You always were.
FO300008548	I'm being reasonable. I'm also being a businessman.
FO300008549	The information about your father must be worth quite a bit to you, otherwise you would never have come back.
FO300008550	With the rise in demand comes the rise in price. The offer is 300 caps, and it stands.
FO300008551	You seem like a nice kid, so I'm going to be straight with you.
FO300008552	Your dad was here, and now he's not, and yes I know where he went. But what you're asking me for is information, and information is a commodity.
FO300008553	Sorry, smoothskin. I can't take the risk. Moriarty will beat the shit out of me for even talking to you!
FO300008554	Sorry, kid. It's not worth the shitstorm I'll bring on myself.
FO300008555	Eulogy Jones pays me enough not to take shit from someone like you.
FO300008556	Besides there's plenty of side "benefits" to keep me happy.
FO300008557	Everyone has a price. What's yours?
FO300008558	But we don't want to give up the safety of the Vault. We just want to end its isolation.
FO300008559	That's what you and my father don't seem to understand!
FO300008560	I've been across this Wasteland, and nowhere's safer than this Vault. Trust me.
FO300008561	But we can't stay isolated forever, or eventually all we'll have left is a handful of inbred remnants!
FO300008562	This Vault is the safest place I've ever seen. It's insane to give that up.
FO300008563	You may think Vault security is just bunch of chubby guys in padded helmets, but I promise you, most of them aren't as friendly as you remember.
FO300008564	Just report in that I'm here for one last visit. I'm sure security won't mind.
FO300008565	Don't worry about it; I won't tell the Overseer if you won't. To tell the truth, I'm glad she did.
FO300008566	Heck, maybe you can even put all this trouble to rest once and for all.
FO300008567	It wasn't a message from her. I just had a hunch she was in trouble. <Lie>
FO300008568	Even they aren't foolish enough to destroy their homes just to prove a point. It could only have been you!
FO300008569	How many of them do you think will survive out there? Still, better a few of them stay alive out there than have them all die down here.
FO300008570	The evacuation will begin immediately. But you won't be joining them outside. I'll see to that myself!
FO300008571	One of the rebels did it to force everyone to leave. <Lie>
FO300008572	The previous Overseers were idiots, and we nearly died because of their naivete. I'm simply trying to make up for their mistakes.
FO300008573	In a generation or two, no one will remember it ever happened, and we'll still be the safest, purest humans left.
FO300008574	But for that to happen, we can't let ourselves be further tarnished by outsiders.
FO300008575	I know that the vault's been open before, and that you lied about its isolation.
FO300008576	We can make more. That's what humanity does. It survives.
FO300008577	You simply don't have enough people to stay isolated down here forever.
FO300008578	That's just a technicality, really. This wasn't what you'd call a "settlement" until I whipped them all into shape. More of a "camp," really.
FO300008579	But I suppose if you really care about what they have to say, you could grill some of the Hangar Deck rabble.
FO300008580	Don't expect a speck of truth from them, Especially not that bartending crone, Belle Bonny. She tells the most disgusting lies.
FO300008581	No, but I can damn sure share a bag of "Get the hell outta my bar."
FO300008582	First one's on the house. Now scram!
FO300008583	I think most of the people from back then have either moved on or passed away, sorry to say.
FO300008584	Well, I'll just have to prove you wrong, then! Now let's get back to work!
FO300008585	I'm not buying it. I mean, I know it's scary, but you can't half-ass something like this, you know?
FO300008586	Now, go on out there walk through that Minefield like a real researcher!
FO300008587	I'm not buying it. I mean, I know it's scary, but you can't half-ass something like this, you know?
FO300008588	Now, go on out there walk through that Minefield like a real researcher!
FO300008589	I don't think so. I've heard a lot of stories from traders that there's food out there. A whole lot.
FO300008590	Either you weren't looking hard enough, or you didn't really go at all. Either way, I'm going to have to insist you go back again, alright?
FO300008591	I know it's just about a definite that it works right, but I can tell you haven't really tested it out much.
FO300008592	I appreciate your confidence, but I can't stress enough the importance of good research. So please go out and give it a real test, okay?
FO300008593	I don't appreciate that sort of joke, especially not when it's about losing knowledge.
FO300008594	Now you go out there again and get back to looking!
FO300008595	Yeah, yeah, very funny. Just go there and do some real research, will you?
FO300008596	You sir, are a liar, a fraud and likely a spy of the Royal Crown. I warn you not to test my patience. You'll find it wearing quite thin.
FO300008597	We're too poor for that.
FO300008598	Nah. Too rich for me.
FO300008599	Listen up good. I'm running the show here, not you. Now get out hell out of here!
FO300008600	I'm in charge here. Not you. Now get out of my face!
FO300008601	Last time I checked, I was the man in charge around here.  Now get out of my face. I have things to do.
FO300008602	I'm in charge here!
FO300008603	I'm not stupid! You're just pushing me around.
FO300008604	Don't lie to me. Dave would have told me that if it were true.
FO300008605	Um, no dice, roadkill. Now hand over what you got.
FO300008606	That's all I have on me, friend, no deal.
FO300008607	You broke it, didn't you? Way to go, Mirelurk bait. Forget you, I'm outta here.
FO300008608	Well, I never! You, sir, are no gentleman.
FO300008609	Well, I never! You, madam, are no lady.
FO300008610	Get lost.
FO300008611	You're lying. You don't know anything.
FO300008612	Oh, no! You're just trying to get me in trouble. And drunk.
FO300008613	I don't think so.
FO300008614	No way, dude. Like I said. I need the caps.
FO300008615	I've told you everything I can think of.
FO300008616	How about no. 200 caps or no deal.
FO300008617	None of your business. Go bother someone else.
FO300008618	I'm sorry. I am not in a position to help you.
FO300008619	Don't matter how good a time he could show me. Eulogy'd have my head. I like my head where it is.
FO300008620	No! I'm not leaving him!
FO300008621	Hey, I got an idea.
FO300008622	How 'bout you stop tryin' to shine me up before I put a bullet in you.
FO300008623	[sighs] You know what I don't appreciate? I don't appreciate when people try to take advantage of me.
FO300008624	So right now, I'm not looking fondly on you. You want something from me, we do a straight-up deal. You don't try and pull one over on me.
FO300008625	That dog ain't gonna hunt. You're going to have to do better than that.
FO300008626	Mister Crowley was a mercenary I worked with a long time ago.
FO300008627	Wait! You're seeking to discredit me before the next election!
FO300008628	You're status is revoked. You have one hour to leave the Republic or I will have you executed.
FO300008629	How dare you question my military record?
FO300008630	You have one hour to leave the Republic of Dave or I will have you executed.
FO300008631	So you were sent to plunder the treasury?
FO300008632	Your diplomatic status is hereby revoked.
FO300008633	You have one hour to leave the Republic of Dave, or I will have you executed.
FO300008634	Are you accusing me of impropriety? In an election year?
FO300008635	I'll give you one hour to leave the Republic of Dave. After that, I'll have you executed.
FO300008636	You must be joking.
FO300008637	I'm tired of you're presence. Leave the Republic of Dave within the hour, or I'll have you executed.
FO300008638	Oh, trying to be cute, are you? Once you're dead, we'll have plenty of time to find them ourselves.
FO300008639	You're welcome to take your business to another doctor if you don't like my prices.
FO300008640	Sorry, I can't let it go for anything less than 100.
FO300008641	You're in over your head, and no amount of talking is going to get you out of it.
FO300008642	Once you're dead, we'll finish off this pathetic Brotherhood and become the true saviors of the Wasteland.
FO300008643	This ends NOW!
FO300008644	No. Because I don't trust you.
FO300008645	She's a jerk, but she's still one of us.
FO300008646	Can you tell me why Princess gets angry about her nickname?
FO300008647	I don't want to talk about it with you.
FO300008648	You said you used to have another guard. What happened?
FO300008649	No! I'm not supposed to go outside with strangers! Help!
FO300008650	Right. And Brahmin can fly. Idiot.
FO300008651	A murderer and a thief. I'd sooner die.
FO300008652	You've got to be kidding.
FO300008653	I'm saving the rest of my money to buy medical supplies for the town! I've given you all I can afford!
FO300008654	What a horrible thing to say! Is that your idea of a joke?
FO300008655	It's none of your business. Now leave me alone.
FO300008656	You're a big dumb liar.
FO300008657	You first, asshole.
FO300008658	I ought to slap you.
FO300008659	But I think I'll puke instead.
FO300008660	Sir! That's a really stupid idea, sir!
FO300008661	Why should I tell you? You'll just tell everyone else.
FO300008662	So you can take it? No way!
FO300008663	No, no. It's hopeless.
FO300008664	Sorry. You ain't all that good at sweet talking. Maybe if you came back with some caps.
FO300008665	Like I'm going to listen to a little shrimp like you. Get lost, Poindexter.
FO300008666	Nice try, buttwipe.
FO300008667	You must think I'm stupid or something. I'm not falling for any of your tricks!
FO300008668	I'm not stupid, and I'm not falling for your tricks. Forget it!
FO300008669	Who do you think you are? Tenpenny won't allow it. I'm a paying member of the tower. He'll listen to reason. Get out of here!
FO300008670	What?! You must be retarded. Tenpenny won't allow that. I pay good money to live here. You can't just go pushing people around like that.
FO300008671	Who do you think you are? I pay good money to live here. And I run a most prestigious store. You can't push me around like that!
FO300008672	In case you haven't noticed, I run a fabulous shop, and live in the most fabulous of places. You can't push people like me around! Ha!
FO300008673	I've hung with tougher assholes than you. I can handle myself. I'm not afraid of you. Besides, I'm one of Tenpenny's favorites!
FO300008674	No, no. Perhaps if I had more time to rest.
FO300008675	I'm sorry, but that is completely unacceptable.
FO300008676	Ha ha. Really now? I'm afraid you aren't as agile tongued as you'd like to think.
FO300008677	Look. I can't let you in. If you did something stupid, it's my ass on the line. I'm not going to risk it. I need this job. Now get out of here!
FO300008678	I'm just doing my job. Now, back away before I'm forced to shoot you.
FO300008679	Nice try. Are you done wasting my time? Good.
FO300008680	AlertIdle
FO300008681	Who's out there?
FO300008682	Huh. Hearing those damn noises again.
FO300008683	I suggest you show yourself!
FO300008684	Hiding's a coward's game!
FO300008685	Who's there?
FO300008686	Possible target in vicinity.
FO300008687	May have a contact here. Checking.
FO300008688	Target may be in range.
FO300008689	Yellow alert. Keep sharp.
FO300008690	Possible threat detected.
FO300008691	Area may be compromised. Searching.
FO300008692	Come out, you nasty little bug.
FO300008693	Dratted roaches.
FO300008694	If he'd just let us turn the lights on this would be a lot easier.
FO300008695	This stumbling around in the dark is ridiculous.
FO300008696	At least I can finally see where I'm going.
FO300008697	Probably nothing anyway.
FO300008698	You'd better come out, whoever you are!
FO300008699	This is crazy. I'm going to get myself killed.
FO300008700	I can hear you. Come on out.
FO300008701	You playing games with me?
FO300008702	Come on out and let's settle this.
FO300008703	You can hide, but you can't hide forever!
FO300008704	This sucks. Come out and fight me, dammit!
FO300008705	I'm sick of this hiding crap! Where the hell are you?
FO300008706	Hiding is futile.
FO300008707	Come on out and let's fight face to face.
FO300008708	This is a coward's game!
FO300008709	You're exhausting my patience.
FO300008710	Face me, dammit!
FO300008711	This is foolish. Reveal yourself!
FO300008712	Hiding from me? Better hope I don't find you!
FO300008713	Scared, just like a little bitch.
FO300008714	Threat analysis: yellow. Scanning for hostiles.
FO300008715	Alert. Non-combatants are advised to leave the area. Security sweep in progress. Lethal force may be used without warning.
FO300008716	No hostiles detected. Continuing perimeter sweep.
FO300008717	Don't be alarmed if I try to kill you when I find you. It's just the way I've been programmed.
FO300008718	Why don't you just come out where I can see you?
FO300008719	I'll find you eventually, you know.
FO300008720	Where are you?
FO300008721	Scanning for hostiles.
FO300008722	This area clear. Proceeding with search protocol.
FO300008723	Please step into the open and identify yourself. Law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear.
FO300008724	It's just little old me. Nothing to be afraid of.
FO300008725	Someone dirty and disreputable, I shouldn't wonder.
FO300008726	Here kitty-kitty-kitty!
FO300008727	As if I'd know what to do if I found something.
FO300008728	Why not let the robot deal with it?
FO300008729	I'm going to look over here now.
FO300008730	Are you afraid of me? You should be because I'm going to kick your ass when I find you!
FO300008731	Step forward and identify yourself!
FO300008732	Do you think you can hide from me?
FO300008733	I'm starting to get angry. You would not like me when I'm angry.
FO300008734	Are you playing games with me, goddammit?
FO300008735	I cannot wait to find you so I can kill you as a personal favor to Uncle Sam.
FO300008736	Oh goodie. Hide and seek. I haven't played this game in years.
FO300008737	You can't hide forever. You're stink will eventually give you away.
FO300008738	I do so enjoy a good hunt!
FO300008739	Quit hiding and come out and fight!
FO300008740	Come out here, you sissy! Finish what you started!
FO300008741	I'll find you, and then you'll be sorry!
FO300008742	Is that really necessary? I won't hurt you. Come out of there and let's discuss this civilly.
FO300008743	Come now. You're being unsporting.
FO300008744	I know you're out there, clown shoes!
FO300008745	I'm growing tired of this little game of ours. Show yourself!
FO300008746	What's that?
FO300008747	Is someone there?
FO300008748	Something there?
FO300008749	What? I hear somethin'.
FO300008750	Huh? A noise?
FO300008751	Hello? Someone there?
FO300008752	Hmm. I was sure I heard something.
FO300008753	Huh?
FO300008754	What was that?
FO300008755	Maybe I'm just jumpy.
FO300008756	Anybody there?
FO300008757	Hello? Who's there?
FO300008758	LostIdle
FO300008759	Hiding is for fools. Show yourself!
FO300008760	This is foolish. Let's end this!
FO300008761	Expanding search pattern.
FO300008762	Switching to pattern zeta-seven-four.
FO300008763	Still no go on targets.
FO300008764	Still no sign of target.
FO300008765	Scope still negative. No tangos.
FO300008766	Zero targets detected.
FO300008767	Come on out, son, I promise I won't hurt you!
FO300008768	Come on out, miss, I promise I won't hurt you!
FO300008769	You don't really think you can hide from us, do you?
FO300008770	We'll find you eventually. You know that, don't you?
FO300008771	You're only making it worse for yourself by hiding.
FO300008772	It's all a big mistake! Come with me and we'll figure it out together!
FO300008773	I know you're around here.
FO300008774	I can smell ya.
FO300008775	Come on, asshole. I ain't got all day.
FO300008776	I hate this cat and mouse crap.
FO300008777	It's only a matter of time.
FO300008778	Continuing sweep.
FO300008779	Target may still be in area.
FO300008780	Search pattern delta-two.
FO300008781	Still trying to reacquire hostile.
FO300008782	I got nothing here.
FO300008783	Oh, I know you're here. I'll find you.
FO300008784	When you turn up, you're dead.
FO300008785	Only a fuckin' coward hides.
FO300008786	Scared huh? You should be.
FO300008787	No need to hide. It'll all be over soon.
FO300008788	Alert. Non-combatant safety cannot be guaranteed.
FO300008789	Target lock status: red. Continuing perimeter sweep.
FO300008790	Alert. Hostile remains at large. Recommend non-combatants seek secure location.
FO300008791	There's no point in trying to hide from me, you know. I've been programmed to be quite relentless.
FO300008792	Please come back. I'm sorry about all that recent unpleasantness.
FO300008793	Where are you?
FO300008794	Are you still there?
FO300008795	Warning. Dangerous fugitive is on the loose. Do not attempt to apprehend.
FO300008796	Attention. Fugitive should be considered armed and dangerous.
FO300008797	Continuing search for fugitive.
FO300008798	You better run, you commie-loving bastard!
FO300008799	Who's got a target?
FO300008800	Come on, people, I need a target!
FO300008801	Where are you?
FO300008802	This is taking time from my experiments.
FO300008803	Where have you gone?
FO300008804	You can't hide fwom me fowever.
FO300008805	Come out, come out, wherever you are!
FO300008806	Oh goodie. Hide and seek. I haven't played this game in years.
FO300008807	You can't hide forever. You're stink will eventually give you away.
FO300008808	I do so enjoy a good hunt!
FO300008809	Quit hiding and come out and fight!
FO300008810	Come out here, you sissy! Finish what you started!
FO300008811	I'll find you, and then you'll be sorry!
FO300008812	Is that really necessary? I won't hurt you. Come out of there and let's discuss this civilly.
FO300008813	Come now. You're being unsporting.
FO300008814	I'm growing tired of this little game of ours. Show yourself!
FO300008815	You can't hide from me forever.
FO300008816	Gonna find you soon, human!
FO300008817	You have to come out sooner or later.
FO300008818	Here human, human, human. I got a treat for you!
FO300008819	Come out, come out wherever you are!
FO300008820	I'm going to find you.
FO300008821	You can't hide from me forever.
FO300008822	Nothing yet.
FO300008823	Where did you go?
FO300008824	I've got something for you...

FO300008828	Did you take something?
FO300008829	Hey, what are you doing?
FO300008830	Did you find what you were looking for?
FO300008831	Yeah, yeah. I hope you choke on it.
FO300008832	Don't like your deal? Tough shit.
FO300008833	No refunds, asshole.
FO300008834	What wonderful items for the Museum of Dave!
FO300008835	A pleasure doing business with you.
FO300008836	Another satisfied customer.
FO300008837	Give me a shout if you need anything else.
FO300008838	Thanks.
FO300008839	Come again! I should have more stuff in soon.
FO300008840	Always a grab bag with my stuff, see?
FO300008841	Come back later. Never know when I'll get another big find!
FO300008842	Don't forget to sign out.
FO300008843	Try not to break it, outsider.
FO300008844	You done? Good.
FO300008845	That it?
FO300008846	Enjoy!
FO300008847	Come back if you're still hungry!
FO300008848	See you soon, drunky.
FO300008849	Come back when you're sober.
FO300008850	That should liquor you up for a while.
FO300008851	Come back anytime!
FO300008852	Enjoy the drinks.
FO300008853	Enjoy the ride.
FO300008854	You'll be higher that a fucking kite.
FO300008855	Good hunting!

FO300008858	You must come back soon.
FO300008859	It's been a pleasure doing business.
FO300008860	Enjoy your meal.
FO300008861	Just call me if you want that freshened.
FO300008862	Do I look like I care?
FO300008863	ObserveCombat
FO300008864	Holy moley, it's a fight!
FO300008865	Hey, be careful!
FO300008866	What are you doing?
FO300008867	Are you crazy?
FO300008868	None of my business, okay?
FO300008869	I'm staying out of the way.
FO300008870	This should be interesting.
FO300008871	Barbarians.
FO300008872	So much violence in the world these days.
FO300008873	Fight! Fight! Fight!
FO300008874	What's going on?
FO300008875	Yeah! Awesome!
FO300008876	Let's get out of here!
FO300008877	Watch out!
FO300008878	Whoa!
FO300008879	Look out!
FO300008880	Damn, it's a fight!
FO300008881	Ain't none of my business!
FO300008882	This isn't right.
FO300008883	This is what we've come to.
FO300008884	Corpse
FO300008885	TimeToGo
FO300008886	Beat it, mungo.
FO300008887	Move it or lose it.
FO300008888	Get out of here.
FO300008889	You need to leave now, mister.
FO300008890	You need to leave now, miss.
FO300008891	Uh, can you leave now, please? I've got to do something.
FO300008892	Time for you to go.
FO300008893	It's time for you to leave.
FO300008894	You've got to leave now so I can lock up.
FO300008895	I'm locking up, so you'll need to leave.
FO300008896	Come on, let's go.
FO300008897	RadioHello
FO300008898	This is the Overseer.
FO300008899	This is the Overseer.
FO300008900	If anyone can hear this, this is Bob Andersteen.

FO300008909	This next piece is dedicated to my old friend Crazy Wolfgang. No one can scour the Wasteland and find such oddities as you.
FO300008910	I'd like to play this next piece of music for the man out there who keeps an old lady alive and well. Doc Hoff, once again I thank you.
FO300008911	To the traveling merchant who only goes by the name Crow, I thank you for all the times you spent keeping me company. Enjoy the music, my love.
FO300008912	This is just a quick thank you to my new friend. Thank you for bringing me what I'd been searching for all these years.
FO300008913	Music has always been an important part of my life. I hope you enjoy listening to these pieces as much as I enjoy playing them.
FO300008914	Here is another lovely song for a lonely traveler wandering the Wasteland. You know who you are.
FO300008915	If my notes sound sweeter it's all thanks to a special someone who helped out a poor old lady living alone in the Wasteland. Thank you, my friend.
FO300008916	Remember, Agatha is with you on those cold nights. Just keep listening to this broadcast and I'll keep you company. It's the least I can do.
FO300008917	They say recent events have made the world seem like a better place. I hope all of you out there can smile and feel better knowing that it's true.
FO300008918	This next selection was one of my mother's favorites. I hope you'll enjoy hearing it as much as I enjoy playing it.
FO300008919	That song reminded me how wonderful these composers were. How delightful to have such an amazing imagination.
FO300008920	This next piece reminds me of something my husband said. "Friendship is like a violin. Even if the music stops, you'll still have the strings."
FO300008921	Just a word to my Wasteland friends out there. Stay safe, stay healthy and above all, stay happy.
FO300008922	I'm dedicating this next piece of music to my loving husband. May his soul find peace.
FO300008923	People of the Capital Wasteland, you can HEAR MEEEE!!!! Yeeeaa haaaa!!! You can't stop the signal, baby!
FO300008924	If Three Dog were here, he'd say something witty. But he's not. Cause somebody killed him. So you get me playing music. Yay.
FO300008925	It's me again, Margaret the technician, talking into the microphone and hoping somebody gives a shit. Enjoy the music.
FO300008926	This is Margaret again, with another funtabulous round of ancient music. Three Dog's dead, and that's all I got.
FO300008927	This is an automated distress message from Vault-Tec Vault 101. Message begins:
FO300008928	Hey everybody, this is Three Dog, your friendly neighborhood disc jockey. What's a "disc"? Hell if I know. But I'm gonna keep talkin' anyway.
FO300008929	People of the Capital Wasteland! It is I, Three Dog, your ruler! Hear me, and obey! Oh, sorry, that's that OTHER radio station.
FO300008930	Men and ladies, boys and girls, prepare to be astounded, bedazzled, and otherwise stupefied! I am Three Dog, your master of ceremonies!
FO300008931	Thrrreeee Dooooggg! That's me, kids. Comin' to you taped from my fortified bunker in the middle of the D.C. hellhole. Ain't life grand?
FO300008932	Because one dog ain't enough, and two is too low, it's me, Three Dog! How you kids handlin' Post-Apocalyptia today?
FO300008933	Hellooooo Capital Wasteland! This is Three Dog, coming to you loud and proud from Galaxy News Radio.
FO300008934	Wake up, Wasteland! It's me, Three Dog, bringing you all the music and news your little hearts can handle.
FO300008935	You're listening to Galaxy News Radio, and I'm your host, Three Dog, lord and master of all I survey!
FO300008936	GNR. Three Dog. All you need to know.
FO300008937	Repeating message. This is Butcher of Reilly's Rangers sending out an S.O.S. on all known friendly frequencies.
FO300008938	This is Butcher of Reilly's Rangers. If anyone can hear this signal we're in danger and we need your help.
FO300008939	To anyone receiving this message. This is Butcher of the merc company Reilly's Rangers. We're in danger and need help.
FO300008940	To anyone that can receive this. We are in danger and need your help. This is Butcher of Reilly's Rangers.
FO300008941	Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

FO300008945	Greetings to the oppressed masses from the peace-loving peoples of China!
FO300008946	All peace-loving peoples must join together to stop the war of aggression being waged by the Wall Street gang!
FO300008947	The Overseer's authority is absolute.
FO300008948	This is Vault 101, and you're enjoying a brighter future… underground.
FO300008949	Walk. Don't run.
FO300008950	Attention all Raven Rock personnel. This is your President, John Henry Eden.
FO300008951	We stand now at the precipice.
FO300008952	Thank you for listening to Tenpenny Tower radio service. Brought to you by Allistair Tenpenny.
FO300008953	This is Tenpenny Tower radio!
FO300008954	You're listening to Tenpenny Tower radio, the sound of progress!
FO300008955	This is Tenpenny Tower radio, music and inspiring talk for forward thinking people.
FO300008956	MegatonTalkDeathReactionFunny
FO300008957	You're really an asshole, you know that?
FO300008958	That's appalling.
FO300008959	You're going to a special hell, you know that?
FO300008960	Too soon!
FO300008961	You can't be serious.
FO300008962	MegatonTalkEnclaveNegative
FO300008963	From what I hear, they're nothing but bad news.
FO300008964	Yeah, well. We'll see. They can't be worse than those Brotherhood of Steel psychos down in the city.
FO300008965	Yeah, right. I'm not holding out hope for the cavalry to come save the world.
FO300008966	MegatonTalkEnclavePositive
FO300008967	If that's true, then all we have to do is hold out for a little while, right?
FO300008968	I hope you're right. I really do. But after 200 years, don't you think they'd have done something by now?
FO300008969	MegatonTalkDoubt
FO300008970	No! That's terrible!
FO300008971	Terrible business.
FO300008972	Ashes to ashes.
FO300008973	Dibs on their stuff!
FO300008974	All I can say is: better them than me.
FO300008975	Well, on the bright side, now there are more water rations for the rest of us.
FO300008976	My sympathies go out.
FO300008977	It could happen to any of us, you know.
FO300008978	How does the saying go? "Death is like a robe that everyone has to wear."
FO300008979	"Death is as sure for that which is born, as birth is for that which is dead. Therefore grieve not for what is inevitable."
FO300008980	How can I convince you to stop preying on Arefu?
FO300008981	No convincing is necessary. I must say your visit is a pleasant change from what I am accustomed to when dealing with humans.
FO300008982	In light of this, I promise you that no further harm will befall you or Arefu. Of that you have my solemn oath.
FO300008983	Now, what of young Ian? Tell me his decision.
FO300008984	I believe that blood preserved in bloodpacks could provide what you need.
FO300008985	Many years ago, I survived by drinking from fresh bloodpacks I recovered from hospital ruins.
FO300008986	The problem was that these bloodpacks were scarce.
FO300008987	What do you propose?
FO300008988	Oh, come on. I'm a nice guy, really. May I please come in?
FO300008989	Well, okay. But you better not be lying, or else we'll shoot you.
FO300008990	Oh, come on. I'm a nice guy, really. May I please come in?
FO300008991	Well, okay. But you better not be lying, or else we'll shoot you.
FO300008992	Oh, come on. I'm a nice gal, really. May I please come in?
FO300008993	What is this place?
FO300008994	This is Little Lamplight. We live here, and we don't need no mungos messing it up. So just take a hike.
FO300008995	Can I come in?
FO300008996	Hell no! No mungos allowed!
FO300008997	I already told you no. Stop asking!
FO300008998	I really need to get to Vault 87. Do you know the way?
FO300008999	It's not safe, even for someone as brave as you. There's monsters back there.
FO300009000	You don't want to go there. That's where the monsters are.
FO300009001	We got pretty good at keeping them out. Probably better than you could do.
FO300009002	We don't go there. It's bad back there. Ask Mayor if you really want to know.
FO300009003	So you know the way to get there?
FO300009004	Yeah, I do. It's through Murder Pass. Not a real safe way to go, but it's the only door that works.
FO300009005	Yeah, I do. But it's through Little Lamplight, and you're not getting into Little Lamplight. Guess you better find some other way, mungo.
FO300009006	Why, what happened to Sammy and Squirrel?
FO300009007	Them and Penny got themselves caught... By mungos, just like you. Slavers from Paradise Falls.
FO300009008	I told them to watch out, but the stupid kids didn't listen.
FO300009009	Forget it.
FO300009010	Yeah, whatever.
FO300009011	How can I get you to trust me?
FO300009012	Why should I trust you? I got no reason to.
FO300009013	You mungos are nothing but trouble. I ain't gonna let what happened to Sammy and Squirrel happen to anyone else.
FO300009014	You'd do that?
FO300009015	What if I go and help Sammy and the others? Then will you trust me?
FO300009016	Monsters? What monsters?
FO300009017	The big ones. You know, the ones that sort of look like people except they're all wrong.
FO300009018	That's the only way?
FO300009019	It's the only way that works, yeah.
FO300009020	The other door hasn't worked since before I was here. Computer's busted, and not even Joseph can make it work.
FO300009021	Thanks.
FO300009022	If you're going to go through Murder Pass, let me know and I'll have the door opened for you.
FO300009023	But I still say it's a bad idea.
FO300009024	On second thought, never mind.
FO300009025	Okay. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone else you chickened out.
FO300009026	Yeah, I'm sure.
FO300009027	Come on. Let's go get the gate open for you, mungo.
FO300009028	I want to use Murder Pass to reach Vault 87.
FO300009029	Not unless Mayor says it's okay. You'd better ask him.
FO300009030	You sure about that? It's scary in there. Even I don't like going there, and I'm really brave.
FO300009031	Okay, it's your funeral.
FO300009032	Come on. We'll open the gate for you.
FO300009033	Can you turn the computer back on?
FO300009034	Sure, if you want.
FO300009035	Come on. It's over here.
FO300009036	I hear there's a door that doesn't work.
FO300009037	Nuh-uh. Door works fine. Computer's broke.
FO300009038	Well, maybe not broke, but it sure don't work right. I turned it off because it was just wasting power.
FO300009039	Tell me more about Little Lamplight.
FO300009040	Why would I tell you anything? God, you're dumb.
FO300009041	Know anything about the area outside Megaton?
FO300009042	Outside of Megaton? Any place other than here sounds like heaven to me. Fuck this place.
FO300009043	If it weren't for you Wasteland types coming through with your caps, I'd be out of here in a second. Assuming that I could convince Jenny and Leo.
FO300009044	All I know is that I spent too much time out there and beyond that, I ain't gonna talk about it.
FO300009045	The Wasteland? Why the hell would you want to go out there? Listen to me, lass, Megaton has everything you could possibly need. Why go anywhere else?
FO300009046	The Wasteland? Why the hell would you want to go out there? Listen to me, lad, Megaton has everything you could possibly need. Why go anywhere else?
FO300009047	The only advice that I can offer is this: you will find no wealth in the Wasteland greater than that which you will find within yourself.
FO300009048	Bask in Atom's Glow, and you will understand.
FO300009049	Confessor, have you ever traveled outside of Megaton?
FO300009050	None of your fucking business.
FO300009051	What do you know about the Wasteland?
FO300009052	I've said just about all I'm going to say about that.
FO300009053	What do you know about the Wasteland?
FO300009054	What do you know about the Wasteland?
FO300009055	It's called "The Wasteland" for a reason. But there are settlements, too, spread all around. The human race is stubborn like that.
FO300009056	To the south you got Rivet City, but don't bother going to D.C. The place is a warzone.
FO300009057	What can you tell me about Megaton?
FO300009058	Megaton is the best little town you'll find in the Capital Wasteland. Don't let anyone tell you different.
FO300009059	Strong walls, strong people, and strong booze. We've got everything you need to make a life these days.
FO300009060	Megaton is the best little town in the Wasteland. Don't let anyone tell you different.
FO300009061	Stay the fuck out of my business, don't go where you don't belong, and buy your drinks here. That's all you need to know.
FO300009062	Outsiders ask us "why did you build a town around a bomb"? To them, I say: The bomb brings the promise of Division and the gift of the Glow.
FO300009063	I have to say, of all the rat infested hellholes that I've lived in, this one is the least hellish.
FO300009064	Some people hate this place, but I guess it's their right, what the hell do they want out of life? Food, shelter and safety. Works for me.
FO300009065	What do you want to know?
FO300009066	Tell me more about your town.
FO300009067	What's to tell? We're alive, so we've got nothing to complain about, right? And hell, I've got a restaurant! So I have it better than most!
FO300009068	What can I tell you about Megaton? Well, that fucking bomb is killing us all slowly. How's that for a piece of information?
FO300009069	Is there a bar in town?
FO300009070	I apologize, but I cannot encourage the consumption of alcohol. Alcohol impedes our personal quest for the Grand Division.
FO300009071	Just be careful. Moriarty is NOT your friend, no matter what he may say, so don't fall for his lies. And for god's sake, don't trust the man.
FO300009072	I need some equipment. Where's the nearest general store?
FO300009073	Seek out Moira at Craterside Supply, although the true pilgrim relies on Atom to supply all that he needs.
FO300009074	Moira sells all kinds of stuff at her place, Craterside Supply. Take a guess where it is? Heh heh heh heh.
FO300009075	Seek out Moira at Craterside Supply. She's a darling girl.
FO300009076	Check out Craterside Supply. It's on the western side of town.
FO300009077	Where's the closest clinic?
FO300009078	You'll want to see Doc Church next to the Crater. Take your time.
FO300009079	Atom can only heal the wounds of the soul. For wounds of the body, you should see Doc Church. His clinic is directly to the north the Church.
FO300009080	Our clinic is down in the crater, by the bomb. Doc Church is a little rough around the edges, but the man's got talent and compassion.
FO300009081	You'll want to see Doc Church next to the Crater. You can't miss it.
FO300009082	I need to get going.
FO300009083	Yeah, all right.
FO300009084	I'm looking for my father. Middle-aged guy. Maybe you've seen him?
FO300009085	It's like I said, kid. Your dad was here for a bit, but didn't stay long. Said he was going to the Galaxy News Radio station. Southeast, in D.C.
FO300009086	What was it you said about my father, again?
FO300009087	Oh, your daddy passed through here, all right. Here and gone. Got what he came for, and then left. I'm assuming you'll do the same, correct?
FO300009088	Oh, your daddy passed through here, all right. Here and gone. Got what he came for, and then left. I'm assuming you'll do the same, correct?
FO300009089	You took care of our little lost lamb, eh? I knew I could count on you.
FO300009090	How about you just hand over 100 caps and we'll call it even.
FO300009091	I did your stupid favor. Now can you tell me where my father is?
FO300009092	You got memory problems, kid? You ain't getting somethin' for nothin'. So pony up the 300 caps, and THEN we'll talk.
FO300009093	Can you tell me where my father is now?
FO300009094	Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
FO300009095	Oh, yeah! I do remember a guy like that.
FO300009096	Honestly, I usually keep my head down. I tend to get smacked around if I look customers in the eyes. But talk to Moriarty, he'll know more.
FO300009097	I can't talk about that anymore. Moriarty will beat me again if I do.
FO300009098	Yeah, I remember that man. I saw him talking to Moriarty. It's hard to forget handsome men like that.
FO300009099	Not in here, I haven't.
FO300009100	Sorry, man. I haven't seen any cats like that roll through here.
FO300009101	Many of the transient visitors end up at one of Megaton's seedier establishments.
FO300009102	I suggest you speak to Colin Moriarty and continue your search there.
FO300009103	Oh man, you're looking for your dad? That is so sweet! Did he run out on you when you were a kid or something?
FO300009104	Our parents died when we were kids. My brother Leo, he's the oldest, he raised my brother Andy and me. It was hard on him, but we turned out okay.
FO300009105	But God, you don't want to hear about that. I'm sorry, but I haven't seen your dad. He didn't eat at the Brass Lantern. I'd remember if he did.
FO300009106	Are you fucking kidding me? Get out of my face.
FO300009107	I usually avoid most of the Wasteland types that come through here, but there was one guy.
FO300009108	Unlike most of the wannabe heroes that come in, he looked like he could actually read a book without giving himself a headache.
FO300009109	He spent a bunch of time at Moriarty's before moving on. I'd try talking to Colin.
FO300009110	I'm glad we understand each other. Now, have you seen my dad?
FO300009111	I usually avoid most of the Wasteland types that come through here, but there was one guy.
FO300009112	Unlike most of the wannabe heroes that come in, he looked like he could actually read a book without giving himself a headache.
FO300009113	He spent a bunch of time at Moriarty's before moving on. I'd try talking to Colin.
FO300009114	Your father? I don't know, I don't know. Doesn't ring a bell, sorry.
FO300009115	Well, come to think of it, I do remember a stranger coming through here. Had a look in his eye. You know the kind a man gets when he's got a purpose.
FO300009116	Spent some time up in the saloon. Might want to check with Moriarty. Just watch yourself. That man's trouble.
FO300009117	Nope, sorry. I got enough fires to put out in this place that I don't have time to keep tabs on every visitor. I'd ask around town.
FO300009118	Could be the guy I saw at Moriarty's Saloon not too long ago. I'd ask there.
FO300009119	I could use some directions around town.
FO300009120	In each our own way, we are all lost. Where would you like to be, sweet child?
FO300009121	In each our own way, we are all lost. Where would you like to be, brother?
FO300009122	In each our own way, we are all lost. Where would you like to be, sister?
FO300009123	Sure thing, partner. What do you need to find?
FO300009124	<Say nothing.>
FO300009125	Pffft. Nice hat, Calamity Jane.
FO300009126	Just so long as we understand each other. This here is my town. These are my people. You so much as breathe wrong, and I'm gonna fuckin' end ya.
FO300009127	Nice town you got here, sheriff. It's a pleasure to meet you.
FO300009128	Friendly AND well-mannered? I think we're gonna get along just fine. You treat my people nice, and you're welcome to stay as long as you'd like.
FO300009129	Let's talk about something else.
FO300009130	Oh, no problem. I'm not busy at all. Yep. Plenty of time to talk to strangers.
FO300009131	What else do you require, sweet child?
FO300009132	Sure thing. What's on your mind?
FO300009133	What do you wish to discuss?
FO300009134	Is there a weapons dealer around here?
FO300009135	Go see Moira at Craterside Supply. She sells some weapons. Makes some too, from what I hear. Her place is down by the crater.
FO300009136	It saddens me to think how quickly we resort to violence.
FO300009137	You'll probably want to see Moira at Craterside Supply. She sells some weapons. Makes some too, from what I hear. Her place is down by the crater.
FO300009138	It saddens me to think how quickly we resort to violence.
FO300009139	MegatonTalk
FO300009140	Sure thing, Andy. What do you need?
FO300009141	I'm a little busy right now, Andy. What is it?
FO300009142	Yeah, Billy?
FO300009143	Yes, Billy?
FO300009144	Mister Moriarty, sir! What can I do for you?
FO300009145	Yessir, Mister Moriarty? What is it?
FO300009146	Yeah, Colin?
FO300009147	Yes, darling.
FO300009148	Yes, husband?
FO300009149	What did you say to me? WHAT did you say to me? Did I give you permission to speak, you disgusting corpse?
FO300009150	Well I'll be! I could have sworn I heard this corpse speak! But that's impossible. Dead men don't talk, do they? They LISTEN. They OBEY.
FO300009151	Oh, hey Jericho, baby! What's going on?
FO300009152	Jericho, baby! What's happening?
FO300009153	Hey Gob, what's up?
FO300009154	Hiya, Gobbie! Whatcha need?
FO300009155	What's up, son?
FO300009156	What's on your mind, boy?
FO300009157	Yes, Mr. Jericho? What can I do for you?
FO300009158	Sure thing, Mr. Jericho. What do you need?
FO300009159	Yeah, honey. What do you need?
FO300009160	What is it, baby?
FO300009161	Food, Jericho. It's all I had for you yesterday. It's all I have for you today.  It's all I'll ever have for you.
FO300009162	Jericho, you're disgusting. Are you going to order something or not?
FO300009163	What? Me? Why?
FO300009164	I'll help you if I can, what do you need?
FO300009165	Yeah, sure. No problem. Anything I can do to help, you just let me know!
FO300009166	What is it, Leo?
FO300009167	Yeah, dad?
FO300009168	Whatcha need, dad?
FO300009169	For you, sweetheart, anything. What do you need?
FO300009170	Anything for you, honey?
FO300009171	Oh, for the... What?
FO300009172	Yes, good wife?
FO300009173	Yes, my darling?
FO300009174	Yes, Nathan?
FO300009175	Yes, dear?
FO300009176	Oh, heya Nathan. Sorry, I got lost in my work. What do you need?
FO300009177	Sure, Nathan, what's up?
FO300009178	Does the pampered princess seek an audience with her king?
FO300009179	Nova! What can I do for you? Just name it!
FO300009180	MegatonTalk2
FO300009181	We should get us a hooker. We could pull in a lot of money around here... maybe a nice blonde.
FO300009182	You said we could have that talk sometime. You know. About boys. I'm ready! I'm ready now! There's some stuff I need to know. Like, really bad.
FO300009183	I'm tired. I think I'm going to knock off early. I know you won't mind.
FO300009184	It's the tips, Colin. Your customers are actually getting cheaper, if that's even possible. Is a girl supposed to just lie down and take that?
FO300009185	I've been having those visions again. Not while I sleep, dear husband, but waking dreams. I see Atom, finally free! His glory revealed at last!
FO300009186	He came to me again last night, husband. The great Atom! He visited me in my dreams, bid me to spread His gospel. I was infused with His energy!
FO300009187	These floors are filthy, you useless fucking zombie! Next time you sweep, put your back into it.
FO300009188	Christ almighty, Gob, if I told you once I told you a thousand times. Do something about that... oozing. You're scaring off my customers!
FO300009189	I've got blood in my alcohol stream. I blame you. Fix it.
FO300009190	I can't help but notice that I'm sobering up. What are we gonna do about that?
FO300009191	My drink is empty. Fix it.
FO300009192	I just wanted to let you know I reserved some special time for you. You know, as a thank you for all you done for me.
FO300009193	C'mon, Jenny, why you gotta be like that? I'm just trying to be nice to you.
FO300009194	Dammit, Jenny. Why do you have to embarrass me like that, out here in front of all these people?
FO300009195	I noticed some irregularities in the logs here. Are you tracking the drinks that you're selling like I told you?
FO300009196	You came up short again. Now, I don't know what's going on, but it needs to stop.
FO300009197	You know, I got to thinkin'. You and I should do some scavengin' sometime soon. See, we find us an old bike, and get Moira to help us fix her up!
FO300009198	What did you do with my ratchet? I've looked everywhere! Where did you put it?
FO300009199	I was wonderin' if anyone's sold you a Fesson-Moch .45 cal. I need the trigger assembly for this rifle I'm workin' on.
FO300009200	Did you ever get ahold of those shell casings that we talked about? The special alloy ones?
FO300009201	I've been concerned about church attendance lately, Mother. The town's inability to fully accept Atom's promise is... most discouraging.
FO300009202	Have you thought more on that matter we discussed? It's a bold plan, Mother. But I fear the townsfolk may not be ready for such an intervention.
FO300009203	Nathan, you promised me you'd talk to Moira about getting those flower seeds. Please, don't forget. Again.
FO300009204	You look beautiful today, Nova. Just like always.
FO300009205	I was thinkin', maybe you and me, we could go out sometime.
FO300009206	Look, don't give me any of your shit. Now, tell me something, and if you're lyin' I'll know. Are you workin' with the Raiders? You a scout?
FO300009207	Never mind.
FO300009208	Okay.
FO300009209	MegatonTalk3
FO300009210	Yeah. Good idea. Not gonna happen.
FO300009211	And where do you propose that we pick one of those up? We'd have to pay the caravan scavengers, and who knows what they'd bring back.
FO300009212	Shut yer gob, Gob! Ain't that why I named you that to begin with? Cause you talk too goddamn much? Now get your rotting ass back to work!
FO300009213	Jesus Christ, what did I just tell you? Get back to yer job while you still have one!
FO300009214	I remember a time when you screwed more and complained less, Nova dear. Ah, but for the good old days.
FO300009215	*Sigh* Our heavenly Father put you on this earth to test me, is that it? 'Dear Lord, save me from the whinings of thine whore who doth complaineth!'
FO300009216	You're always so nice to me, you know that, Nova? I don't know what I'd do without you, I swear.
FO300009217	I like helping you out, dad. I'm not a kid anymore, you know. Okay, I am a kid. But I can do anything you need me to do. I can handle it.
FO300009218	I'm not going to discuss it, Jericho. You know good and goddamn well why I'm like this and don't you dare play dumb with me.
FO300009219	Don't play stupid with me, Jericho. You know what my problem is.
FO300009220	Is it really that big of a deal if your little papers don't add up? Why are you always hassling me about this?
FO300009221	So we end up a few caps short at the end of the night. Who cares? It's not going to break us. Get off my back, man.
FO300009222	Oh man. I did say that, didn't I? Okay. Yeah, yeah we can do that. I've got some stuff to take care of, but after that, it's you and me! Okay, pal?
FO300009223	Oh, yes! Please, please, please! Can we Billy? We could have so much fun. More fun than we could in Megaton, that's for sure!
FO300009224	You mean it? Oh Billy, thank you! Thank you so much! I can't wait!
FO300009225	*Tsk* You boys and your toys. I know better than to touch your things, dear. If it's lost, YOU lost it.
FO300009226	Breathtaking, my love. Soon, Atom's glory will be upon us. Very soon.
FO300009227	We should stay our course, dearest husband. Atom's power penetrates us all, does it not? Soon, every soul of Megaton will revel in His glory!
FO300009228	Do not despair, dearest husband. Soon, all of Megaton will bask in Atom's glow.
FO300009229	*Sigh* All right, Colin, all right. Just lay off, already. Please?
FO300009230	Oh, you're so sweet, Gob.
FO300009231	Jericho, baby. We've talked about this. Colin' don't want me seein' customers outside of work. He thinks our business is best kept professional.
FO300009232	Who told you that?
FO300009233	Me? A Raider? Are you joking? I'm not a Raider! I've never even met a Raider before!
FO300009234	I'm not a Raider! I swear! Who told you that? They're lying!
FO300009235	Me? Working with Raiders? Hell no! I just want to get a place here in Megaton, and I'll kill any Raider who shows up here to prove it!
FO300009236	And you're supposed to be the smart one?
FO300009237	Hey, I am smart. Jerk.
FO300009238	Don't you have the password?
FO300009239	Nope. Nobody ever wrote it down, and then one day somebody forgot. You know how it goes.
FO300009240	Oh! Sorry, I guess I got ahead of myself, huh? Maggie's nine, sweetest little girl you'd ever care to meet. We take care of each other.
FO300009241	I ain't never had a daughter, but if I did, I'd want her to be Maggie. I took her in when her parents got killed by Raiders. That was two years ago.
FO300009242	It was a pretty bad scene. Small settlement up north. I'd stopped in to trade some salvage, and the whole place had been wiped out.
FO300009243	I found Maggie hiding under a bed, in the same room where her parents had been butchered. We've been together ever since.
FO300009244	I have to go now.
FO300009245	Please, do what you can to find my brother.
FO300009246	Hey, thanks again for doing this for me, it means a lot.
FO300009247	Remember, my offer still stands.
FO300009248	All right, goodbye.
FO300009249	Tell me about the Family.
FO300009250	I think they live somewhere east or northeast of here. Problem is, they always travel in the dark so I can't see exactly where they go.
FO300009251	There's all kinds of places they could be hiding like Hamilton's Hideaway, the old Moonbeam Cinema or Northwest Seneca Metro Station.
FO300009252	Where do you think I can find the Family?
FO300009253	All they do is terrorize us. They taunt us to open our doors, throw bottles at our houses and scream at us.
FO300009254	If I knew King had my back, I'd step outside and show them just how I feel about their visits... especially after this last attack.
FO300009255	What do you think about the Family?
FO300009256	They're lowlife scum who decided to use Arefu as their own personal amusement park. Oh, they're a fun bunch.
FO300009257	I'd take a shot at them if I could but judging from what they did to the Brahmin, I wouldn't live long to tell about it.
FO300009258	What do you think about the Family?
FO300009259	Even if all of us look different on the outside, we all had the same vice infesting our insides.
FO300009260	But now, through my teachings, these subjugated people have come together and formed a bond stronger than mere friendship.
FO300009261	We are a badass gang and we don't take shit from nobody.
FO300009262	We also don't like nosy assholes who creep around asking too many stupid questions.
FO300009263	It's a great way to get back at those assholes out there who think we're losers.
FO300009264	If it wasn't for Vance, I'd still be getting the crap beat out of me by those guards in Rivet City.
FO300009265	My husband started this group not long ago. He was trying to save them from a life of hardship and ridicule.
FO300009266	They come from all over the Wasteland now to find us and become part of the Family.
FO300009267	How about just the coolest gang this side of the U.S.?
FO300009268	As long as we listen to Vance's rules and listen to his stuff, he lets us do pretty much whatever we want.
FO300009269	Well, anyone that Vance takes in because of their special problems can be part of the Family.
FO300009270	Can you tell me more about what's been going on around here?
FO300009271	There used to be more families living here. Most of them have dismantled their shacks and moved on to greener pastures.
FO300009272	Those that are still living here are keeping themselves indoors thanks to the Family.
FO300009273	We're scared shitless. Evan King's got everyone so worked up about the Family, no one wants to set foot outside.
FO300009274	That asshole runs the show, but does he really do anything about our problem? No.
FO300009275	Everyone is keeping themselves safe from the Family. If I was you, I'd do the same.
FO300009276	You want to know more, talk to Evan King.
FO300009277	Oh my, I don't know. Mrs. West is probably whipping up a batch of her famous cookies and all the kids are playing in the yards.
FO300009278	It's so nice outside, the grass looks lovely this time of year.
FO300009279	None of your business.
FO300009280	Hmph. Well, that's the attitude I've come to know from most of the people around this town. Folks like to keep to themselves.
FO300009281	I don't want your life story, I just want a little bit of a favor. Think you're up to it?
FO300009282	I'm just passing through.
FO300009283	Nobody just passes through here. There's nothing to get to by way of this shithole. You've found yourself at a dead-end.
FO300009284	The only bastards that still pass through are the Family. They're some lowlife gangers who've been giving us a hell of a lot of trouble lately.
FO300009285	They're the reason for my itchy trigger finger.
FO300009286	I'm looking for Ian West. Have you seen him?
FO300009287	I haven't seen any of the Wests since we were told to head indoors.
FO300009288	Nope. Everyone stays inside, except Evan King of course.
FO300009289	If I recall he and the boys are probably at the lake fishing. Those rapscallions! There's no telling what monkeyshines they'll get into next!
FO300009290	I had always assumed if a human happened upon our home, it would be for the purpose of our extermination.
FO300009291	It appears my fears were ill-placed. It is a pleasant surprise to meet someone as amenable as yourself.
FO300009292	Very well. I will allow you to speak to Ian. Perhaps you can help him come to grips with his greatest enemy. Himself.
FO300009293	Now that I have a better understanding of the Family, may I speak to Ian?
FO300009294	I believe I was very clear when I said you are not welcome to see him.
FO300009295	Please allow me to speak to Ian.
FO300009296	Ah yes, my newest charge. What would you want with him?
FO300009297	I've been searching for a young man named Ian West.
FO300009298	I'm afraid Vance has him in isolation and there is no way I'm going to override Vance's orders.
FO300009299	Like I said, he's in isolation. It's his time to meditate and reflect.
FO300009300	Anything else you can tell me about Ian West?
FO300009301	Vance has him in meditation right now. No one's supposed to be in there.
FO300009302	Nope. Like I told ya, Vance has him in meditation right now. No one's supposed to be in there.
FO300009303	Anything else you can tell me about Ian West?
FO300009304	I don't have any authority here. I'm pretty new myself.
FO300009305	Justin's been trying to talk to Ian; make him feel better. Maybe you should speak to him.
FO300009306	Do I look like a fucking babysitter? I don't know where he is. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.
FO300009307	Ian, Ian, Ian! Is that all you've got to say? Sheesh.
FO300009308	Anything else you can tell me about Ian West?
FO300009309	Ian? What do you want from him?
FO300009310	No, just that Vance said he isn't to be disturbed while he's in meditation.
FO300009311	Anything else you can tell me about Ian West?
FO300009312	What kind of trouble?
FO300009313	Well at first they'd do typical gang bullshit. You know, break stuff and make lots of noise, but they always kept their distance.
FO300009314	But this last time, they went too far. They killed all of our Brahmin! I mean, that's our lifeblood out here you know!
FO300009315	What's the word around town?
FO300009316	Hey, maybe I'll put that on the sign out front: "The Brass Lantern: Cleaner, safer, and less likely to have piss in the drinks".
FO300009317	People've been sayin' that there's somethin' wrong with the water purifier. But Ol' Walter's been keepin' that thing runnin' for decades.
FO300009318	Not sure if you've met her, but Lucy West, that pretty young thing? She's afraid. Of what, of who, I couldn't say. But you can feel the fear on her.
FO300009319	News? My friend, I take effort not to be involved in such worldly business. Earthly pursuits distract from Atom.
FO300009320	What's the news?
FO300009321	I already told you about the Stahl boy's drug problem. You said you wanted to help.
FO300009322	That's about all the confidences I'm going to break for you, stranger.
FO300009323	What do you know about the people here?
FO300009324	A doctor doesn't talk about his patients. At least not to strangers, he doesn't.
FO300009325	What do you know about the people here?
FO300009326	I ain't heard much. Truth be told, I don't really ever leave the Lantern. Too much work, too few hours in the day, y'know?
FO300009327	Remember what I told you, kid: Moriarty keeps his money locked up right next to his bed.
FO300009328	A little drinkin' money might loosen my lips a bit. Give it a try. See what happens.
FO300009329	Hey, I'm not much of a mudslinger. I don't like to spread stuff around, you know what I mean? Everybody has their secrets. Let's keep them that way.
FO300009330	I'm sorry, I just haven't been paying any attention at all since Nathan died.
FO300009331	There's only one thing that concerns me in this town these days: what my damn fool husband is doing.
FO300009332	He wanders around here all day and all night, preaching about the Enclave and tryin' to get parts for his guns.
FO300009333	I'm not sure who's the bigger fool, him or me. After all, I married him.
FO300009334	I'm not one to gossip, but I do know a few things. For instance, did you hear that Lucas wants someone to disarm our bomb?
FO300009335	Imagine the blasphemy! I can't believe it! I mean, I don't believe it. He would never do that to us.
FO300009336	Sure, you got the purifier working right again, but if it runs out of water to pump then we're still screwed.
FO300009337	Well, people've been sayin' that the water purifier's about to go. Honestly, I'll tell you what I tell them.
FO300009338	I've been keeping that wreck going for thirty-five years and this is the first time I've ever had a problem I couldn't fix.
FO300009339	I couldn't tell you, really. I'd talk to Manya if you care that much. She's lived in Megaton longer than anyone.
FO300009340	Let's cut to the chase. How much for you to tell me where my father is?
FO300009341	Seems a fair price to facilitate a family reunion. Don't you think?
FO300009342	Tell me where he is, Moriarty, or I'll beat it out of you!
FO300009343	Listen carefully. I don't know what Sheriff Simms told you, but this is my town. Simms, he's a facade. An illusion of order I allow to exist.
FO300009344	I was slinging drinks and killing Raiders here in Megaton when the good sheriff was just an idiot kid with cowboy fantasies.
FO300009345	Look, I just want to find my Dad. Do you know where he is?
FO300009346	You seem like a nice kid, so I'm going to be straight with you.
FO300009347	Your dad was here, and now he's not, and yes I know where he went. But what you're asking me for is information, and information is a commodity.
FO300009348	You're lying. The Vault's been sealed for 200 years!
FO300009349	That's right. Your father, his Brotherhood of Steel friend, and you, the suckling babe with nary a tit to suckle. Sorry about your mum. Truly.
FO300009350	Tell me what you know! Tell me everything!
FO300009351	Ah, temper, temper. And your father was so reserved. Take after our mum, do we? God rest her soul.
FO300009352	But all least you've got balls. Yeah, I know your dad, met him when you were just a baby, when you two passed through here on your way to the Vault.
FO300009353	You look shocked. You didn't think you were born in that hole, did you? Good Christ, boy. Know the truth, and it will set you free.
FO300009354	Ah, temper, temper. And your father was so reserved. Take after our mum, do we? God rest her soul.
FO300009355	But all least you've got spunk. Yeah, I know your dad, met him when you were just a baby, when you two passed through here on your way to the Vault.
FO300009356	You look shocked. You didn't think you were born in that hole, did you? Ah, Lord.... Know the truth, and it will set you free.
FO300009357	Is that what your father told you? That you were born in that hole? That HE was born there as well?
FO300009358	Oh, the lies we tell to those we love.
FO300009359	That's right. Your father, his Brotherhood of Steel friend, and you, the suckling babe with nary a tit to suckle. Sorry about your mom. Truly.
FO300009360	I was kidding! Dad talked about you all time. Now really, where is he? <Lie.>
FO300009361	Well, he did come through here, but he left. I'm truly sorry. But maybe you can catch up to him?
FO300009362	He headed southeast, into the city. Said he needed information from those loonies at the station. You know, Galaxy News Radio, what there is of it.
FO300009363	I met a man named Burke. He said he'd pay me to rig the bomb to explode.
FO300009364	I told you: Stop playing games with me. Now, run along before I decide to throw you in a cell for disturbing the peace.
FO300009365	Actually, Burke really does want to blow up Megaton.
FO300009366	What's on the menu?
FO300009367	Sorry, hon. The noodle stand is closed. If you want something, ask Leo in the restaurant.
FO300009368	Here, take a look.
FO300009369	Hey, I won't say it's all fresh, but it'll keep you going.
FO300009370	MegatonTalk5
FO300009371	Okay, Andy. I'll try.
FO300009372	You really need to relax, Andy.
FO300009373	People don't change, Jericho. Now order something and leave me alone.
FO300009374	No, Jericho. Just no. Now leave me alone.
FO300009375	Sorry, hon. I'm a lifer here. Just go drink your drink.
FO300009376	Then you best unhear it. I know all about you, old man. I'd be careful before I went around town spreading rumors about Raiders. You dig?
FO300009377	You can tell me that when you're the one paying the bills, Leo.
FO300009378	MegatonTalk4
FO300009379	You know, it's not all about money, Andy.
FO300009380	Geez, Billy, you're so timid with this stuff. I won't be a kid forever, you know.
FO300009381	Yes sir, Mister Moriarty!
FO300009382	You're all heart, you know that, Colin?
FO300009383	Thanks a lot, Colin. I can always count on you for sympathy and respect.
FO300009384	All right, all right! Stop your pathetic sniveling and just do what you're fucking told.
FO300009385	Gob? If I hear one more excuse come out of that rotting mouth, I'm going to sew it shut. Okay? There's a good zombie.
FO300009386	Hey, if we ain't going to look out for each other, what's the point? You think Colin gives a shit about us, Gob? Come on, sweetie, wake up.
FO300009387	I know, Harden. I know. You make me proud every day, son. What can I say, you're just like your dad! He he he he he.
FO300009388	Hey, you think it's easy, seeing my little boy turn into a man? Ha ha ha ha! Don't grow up too quick on me, you hear!
FO300009389	Jenny, baby. That was a long time ago. I've left all that behind me now.
FO300009390	Look, Jenny, that was years ago. I'm a different man now.
FO300009391	If these books don't add up, I don't know how much money we have, then how are we supposed to stay in business? Would you just be more careful?
FO300009392	It's important, Leo! I have to keep our head above water here. Please, just try to be more careful.
FO300009393	Okay, dad. But I'm going to hold you to it, this time.
FO300009394	You're kidding, right? You mean it this time? For real? Great! Great, dad, I can't wait! Thanks!
FO300009395	Ha ha! I just love seeing you happy, sweetheart.
FO300009396	Well all right then! It's settled! I'll set my affairs in order, as they say, and we'll sit down and plan this thing out.
FO300009397	Aggh! Damnit! But I've looked everywhere! *Sigh* All right. Thanks, I guess.
FO300009398	I hear things. I know a few people. What of it?
FO300009399	Thank you, Nathan dear.
FO300009400	Fine. But if we have this conversation again, I'll be forced to turn off the charm.
FO300009401	Anything for you, Nova. Anytime.
FO300009402	No thanks. I'll find out on my own.
FO300009403	Will you? Well, good luck with that. So far as I know, I'm the only one your Dad told where he was going.
FO300009404	All right, Moriarty. Here's 100 caps. Now where's my father?
FO300009405	Excellent! Your dad raised a smart kid. Really no substitute for the love of a father, now is there?
FO300009406	Speaking of dear old dad, he went southeast, into D.C. to the Galaxy News Radio station. Good luck now.
FO300009407	I don't have 100 caps.
FO300009408	If you don't have the caps to pay for the information, then maybe you could do a little favor for me.
FO300009409	I want to buy a drink.
FO300009410	No problem at all. I'll take care of you until that lazy zombie wakes up to do his job.
FO300009411	Tell it to Gob, he'll get you whatever you need.
FO300009412	Sounds like you're pretty screwed. You're on your own.
FO300009413	Fine. That's what I've come to expect from strangers. Always thinking of themselves.
FO300009414	Why don't you just get out of Arefu? I've got a road to watch.
FO300009415	Playing games with me, huh? Fine. I got better things to do.
FO300009416	Nope. You're still on your own.
FO300009417	I'd be glad to help. What do you need?
FO300009418	I don't want to take my eyes off the ramp here. There's no telling when the Family will return.
FO300009419	Can you do me a favor and check on the other people's houses here? You know, make sure they're doing okay.
FO300009420	Speak with Davis West, Karen Schenzy and Ken Ewers.
FO300009421	Who did you think I was?
FO300009422	I thought you were one of the Family. They're some lowlife gangers who've been giving us a hell of a lot of trouble lately.
FO300009423	They're the reason for my itchy trigger finger.
FO300009424	Why is this place called Gary's Galley?
FO300009425	It's named after my dad. He's dead. I used to help him run it, but now it's just me.
FO300009426	It's named after my dad. He's a great cook.
FO300009427	You're too chicken to run away.
FO300009428	Shut up, butt wipe.
FO300009429	Stop saying that, butt face.
FO300009430	Oh, yeah? I'll show you! I'll show all of you. My mother will be sorry.
FO300009431	Welcome to Tenpenny Tower! Don't do anything stupid.
FO300009432	MS12ArgumentTopic
FO300009433	You can tell Tenpenny he can kiss my ass! We got plenty of bottlecaps! Let me in, goddamnit!
FO300009434	How many times do we have to go through this? You're not getting in!
FO300009435	I can stand here all day yelling at you through this damn speaker if I have to!
FO300009436	I've already told you Tenpenny won't allow zombies to live here!
FO300009437	Who the hell are you calling a zombie?
FO300009438	You're definitely not human, that's for damn sure. For the last time: NO ZOMBIES ALLOWED!
FO300009439	Can't tell the difference between me and a feral? Fine. I'll show you the goddamn difference! Just you wait! You'll get yours. All of you!
FO300009440	Just let me in already!
FO300009441	Nope. Now get the hell out of here.
FO300009442	Tenpenny is expecting me. I'm a new tenant. <Lie.>
FO300009443	Nice try kid! I know everyone who lives here, even the new ones. It's my job, and I take my job very seriously.
FO300009444	It's also my job to deal with anyone I consider a threat to Mister Tenpenny or his property. Feel free to stand there all day. I don't care.
FO300009445	I have a lucrative offer for Tenpenny. Let me in, or you'll come to regret it.
FO300009446	Just a minute. Let's not be hasty. If Tenpenny is interested in what you have to say, I suppose you should get your chance.
FO300009447	Though, he normally conducts all his business through Mister Burke. If Tenpenny doesn't want to talk to you, then you best leave him alone.
FO300009448	If you bother Mister Tenpenny or any of his residents, I will be very glad to forcibly show you out. Do we understand each other? Good.
FO300009449	I'm here to see Tenpenny.
FO300009450	Hahaha! That's rich. What would a man like Tenpenny want to do with a Waste-rat like you?
FO300009451	Open the damn gate! I'm done being interrogated by you!
FO300009452	You're really not in a position to be threatening me. I'm safe on the other side of this wall, and you are out there, exposed and unsafe.
FO300009453	You have a lot to learn, kid. I think I'll let the Wasteland teach it to you. Try not to die out there!
FO300009454	Come on, let me in. Just for a little while. I won't cause any trouble.
FO300009455	You're not getting in. Stop trying. It's not working. I'm done talking to you.
FO300009456	Good luck out there!
FO300009457	That's where you're mistaken. Does 100 caps sound about right?
FO300009458	You're poor, and stupid. Count your damn purse before you go offering people gifts.
FO300009459	Tell you what. You manage to scrape together 100 caps, and I'll let you in to look around a little.
FO300009460	Perhaps you'll fit in around here better than I thought. Alright. I'll take your money. But don't press your luck. I got my eye on you.
FO300009461	Don't bother Tenpenny or the other residents. If you so much as sneeze in the wrong direction... I'll gut you!
FO300009462	I just want to look around a little. Come on. I won't hurt anybody.
FO300009463	This ain't a theme park, kid. And even if it was, you wouldn't be able to afford the admission. Now bugger off!
FO300009464	You going to let me in or not?
FO300009465	Listen. Like I've told those Ghouls a thousand times, I can't just let in every drifter that lands at the gate.
FO300009466	You got a reason to be here, or what?
FO300009467	I kill Ghouls and rent-a-cops with attitudes who ask too many questions.
FO300009468	Oh ho! Looks like we got a live one here! I think we better leave this one outside. Good bye, kid. Try not to get eaten by anything out there.
FO300009469	I've killed so many Ghouls, I've stopped counting.
FO300009470	Is that so? Then I'm sure you can handle yourself out there in the Wasteland just fine. Are you done wasting my time?
FO300009471	I can help take care of that little Ghoul problem for you.
FO300009472	Is that so? And why should I believe that? You ever kill a Ghoul before?
FO300009473	I don't think you're talking to the person you think you are.
FO300009474	You are trespassing on Allistair Tenpenny's private property. Renters and official business only.
FO300009475	Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
FO300009476	What? Oh. Sorry 'bout that. I thought you were one of those damned Ghouls looking for a handout.
FO300009477	You are currently trespassing on Allistair Tenpenny's private property. You have some reason to be here?
FO300009478	Is that how you treat all your guests?
FO300009479	What? No, just those damn Ghouls. Sorry, thought you were one of them.
FO300009480	Ghoul or not, I must inform you that you are trespassing on Allistair Tenpenny's private property. Renters and official business only.
FO300009481	I don't care who you think you are. You're not getting in down there.
FO300009482	I've got the only key, and I ain't lending it to you. I lost it once and had to make a new one. Tenpenny practically bit my head off. So forget it.
FO300009483	Look, I'm not an idiot. I won't break anything.
FO300009484	That's awfully brash of you! You think you got what it takes?
FO300009485	The trick to "exploring" is to make sure no one knows you've done it. My neighbors, for instance, have no idea that I know so much about them!
FO300009486	I'll make you a deal kid. You can borrow my key, IF you can find it without letting me see you take it. Good luck!
FO300009487	You want Gustavo to catch you with that? Better let me hold onto it, old man.
FO300009488	I've got the only key, and I ain't lending it to you. I lost it once and had to make a new one. Tenpenny practically bit my head off. So forget it.
FO300009489	If I promise not to touch anything, will you let me in?
FO300009490	Have you noticed how he turns a delightful shade of purple when he's angry?
FO300009491	Well, kid. There're two keys floating around. Which one do you think you can nab without getting caught? Good luck!
FO300009492	Are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?
FO300009493	What?!
FO300009494	That area is strictly off limits. Can't have people fooling around with the terminal down there. They could shut off power and open the escape door.
FO300009495	What can you tell me about the basement?
FO300009496	That area is off limits to residents and visitors. Only Gustavo and authorized technicians are allowed down there.
FO300009497	That emergency access door is currently keeping out Ghouls and other vermin. So you can see why people aren't allowed to picnic down there.
FO300009498	I've heard this place has a basement. How do I get to it?
FO300009499	You mean the generator room? What the hell do you need to know about that for? That area is strictly off limits.
FO300009500	What can you tell me about the basement of Tenpenny Tower?
FO300009501	You stay away from the generator room!
FO300009502	What can you tell me about the basement of Tenpenny Tower?
FO300009503	I hear there're some tunnels underground for use in emergencies. Ask Gustavo, he's in charge of all those kinds of things.
FO300009504	Do you know anything about the basement?
FO300009505	Occasionally something goes wrong down there and we lose power. Then Burke goes out and finds a technician. We haven't had any blackouts in a while.
FO300009506	If you want to get into the gen room, you'll need to talk to Gustavo. Though I doubt he'll take you on a tour, or let you wander around down there.
FO300009507	Hey doc, what do you know about the basement area?
FO300009508	Why would I ever go to the basement? Talk to Gustavo about such nonsense.
FO300009509	You ever been to the basement?
FO300009510	Aha! So you've been exploring the tower! Well done! Let's just say that Gustavo's not the only one with a key for the generator room!
FO300009511	Do you know anything about the basement and emergency tunnels?
FO300009512	Bah! I thought you were more interesting than that. Fine. But you better not get caught with that!
FO300009513	Oh, you know who you should talk to? Comrade Dashwood. He knows this place like the back of his hand.
FO300009514	Do you know anything about the basement level, comrade?
FO300009515	What are you talking about? You mean the basement of Tenpenny Tower? What a random question. Why should I know anything about a basement?
FO300009516	Why don't you run off and find Gustavo. I'm sure he could help you find whatever it is you're looking for.
FO300009517	What can you tell me about the basement?
FO300009518	I haven't. But every so often Gustavo takes someone down there to work on the generators when we lose power. That hasn't happened in awhile, though.
FO300009519	You ever go down to the basement?
FO300009520	Tunnels in the basement? No can't say that I do.
FO300009521	Daring! Daring Dashwood! That's him. He's explored this whole place from top to bottom. Ask him about those tunnels. He'd know.
FO300009522	I don't suppose you know anything about the basement? And some tunnels?
FO300009523	What do you take me for? Some greasy engineer? All I know is that's where they make the electricity.
FO300009524	Why don't you go bother Gustavo? I'm sure he can handle whatever it is you need in the basement.
FO300009525	Do you know much about what's in the basement?
FO300009526	Yeah, supposedly there's some kind of emergency access to the Metro tunnels.
FO300009527	It'd have to be a pretty big emergency to get me down there. That's for sure. There's all kinds of gross things that live in those tunnels.
FO300009528	Talk to Chief Gustavo if you want to know more. I think he's the only one that has a key.
FO300009529	Maybe try talking to Mister Tenpenny or Chief Gustavo. They're probably the ones who would know.
FO300009530	Do you know how I can get into the basement?
FO300009531	I told you Gob, it ain't the radio. The Enclave station comes in fine. It's Galaxy News. Their signal's been shit lately.
FO300009532	MegGobRadioTalk
FO300009533	Aw, forget it. I guess we're stuck with this Enclave crap.
FO300009534	Come on!
FO300009535	Stupid radio!
FO300009536	Work! Come on. Work!
FO300009537	Goddamn radio!
FO300009538	Son of a bitch!
FO300009539	You should be in a sanitarium, or a prison! You're out of your damned mind! You just stay away from me, you hear me?
FO300009540	I'm scaring YOU? After you beat that poor woman to death? You've really lost it, Janet. You're crazy!
FO300009541	Roger, stop it. You're scaring me!
FO300009542	How could you? How could you do that to her? Have you lost your mind?
FO300009543	What on earth are you talking about, Roger?
FO300009544	What do you know about Vault 87?
FO300009545	That's behind the Back Door! The Back Door is my job, and I do it really well!
FO300009546	See what happens is, Mayor says he wants the door open. Then I help him because I'm good at it. It takes two of us to do it.
FO300009547	But only Mayor can say it's okay. You gotta talk to him, and then I'll help him.
FO300009548	Not much, really. Mayor has us steer clear of the door to Murder Pass, just in case. If you go near it, you can hear them howling.
FO300009549	Can't hear much around the other door, though. I guess maybe there aren't as many back there. Doesn't matter much, though.
FO300009550	Yeah, I know that place. Yep, sure do. Monsters back there. Big, scary monsters. Lots of them. Tons, even.
FO300009551	Are you going there? Are you? Are you gonna shoot 'em dead? I bet you are. That'll be so cool. Unless they eat your face. They do that, you know.
FO300009552	That's where the monsters come from. We don't go back there. It's called Murder Pass for a reason, you know?
FO300009553	If you go that way, you're probably gonna get hurt. I can patch you up as long as it's not real bad.
FO300009554	I don't know what that is, mister.
FO300009555	Very well. We'll sort this all out.
FO300009556	Yes. She knows what we need. Vault-Tec computer, something to locate equipment. Please help her.
FO300009557	Yes. He knows what we need. Vault-Tec computer, something to locate equipment. Please help him.
FO300009558	All right, Madison. It'll be okay. Now, this is James' daughter, I presume? I can see the resemblance.
FO300009559	All right, Madison. It'll be okay. Now, this is James' son, I presume? I can see the resemblance.
FO300009560	Is that so? Does the Enclave know this?
FO300009561	Now now, calm down. You know as well as I do that the purifier doesn't work. It's useless to them. Perhaps it's time to walk away.
FO300009562	Then do something now! They've taken over the purifier. Lyons, they cannot be permitted to have control over it. It's not right!
FO300009563	Yes, I'd heard reports of an incident there. What details can you give us?
FO300009564	Don't talk down to me, Lyons. I had nowhere else to turn. You must help us. Project Purity has been overrun.
FO300009565	Madison, I'm surprised to see you here. What can I do for you?
FO300009566	Do you suspect your family is in danger?
FO300009567	Where is Arefu?
FO300009568	Arefu is northwest of Megaton on an old overpass over the Potomac. If you follow what's left of the river, you can't miss it.
FO300009569	A job usually means I get paid.
FO300009570	Actually, I don't have any caps with me. I used everything I had buying a shack in this town.
FO300009571	But if you'd be nice enough to help me, I bet my father would pay you something for all the trip. What do you say?
FO300009572	Nope, sorry.
FO300009573	Alright. Let me know if you change your mind.
FO300009574	Sure, why not.
FO300009575	Great! I'd like you to deliver this message to my family in the Arefu Settlement. I haven't heard from them in months and I'm worried.
FO300009576	As soon as you get there, talk to Davis West. He'll be glad to pay you for the trip.
FO300009577	Today we hear the story of Saint Monica.
FO300009578	She was born in Great Lanta on the shores of the Ocean.
FO300009579	Her parents were both Ghouls. Yes, that’s right, I said Ghouls.
FO300009580	That she was conceived at all was a miracle. That she was born unafflicted was an even greater miracle.
FO300009581	God tested Saint Monica. She did not lead an easy life.
FO300009582	Sold into slavery by Raiders, she was forced to sell her body.
FO300009583	They took her only son, Ehren, from her and sold him.
FO300009584	She prayed every night to God for his safety. She did not pray for herself, although her burden was great.
FO300009585	Each night she would preach the word of God to the Slavers.
FO300009586	After sixteen years, God provided a miracle.
FO300009587	One of the Slavers repented his wicked ways and helped her to escape.
FO300009588	Four years she looked for Ehren. Four years she wandered the Wasteland.
FO300009589	God looked over her in those years.
FO300009590	When she found her son, she found he was a wicked man.
FO300009591	Ehren had overthrown his masters and taken their place. He was an owner of men.
FO300009592	Ehren took his mother to be his slave, even knowing who she was, for Ehren blamed her for his painful early life.
FO300009593	Each day Ehren would think of a new and wicked trial to put her through.
FO300009594	She would only smile at him and say, "I forgive you."
FO300009595	Each morning she would be miraculously healed as if nothing had happened.
FO300009596	When Ehren truly realized her love and God's love was boundless, he flung himself at her feet and begged for Saint Monica’s forgiveness.
FO300009597	Ehren released all of his slaves, and they rejoiced.
FO300009598	He repented all his wicked ways.
FO300009599	Who among us is without sin? Who among us can claim to be innocent?
FO300009600	Come, brothers and sisters, let us pray to God and Saint Monica for deliverance from our sins, as Ehren was delivered from his.
FO300009601	Amen. Let us pray.
FO300009602	Let's discuss this bomb.
FO300009603	What about it?
FO300009604	Goodbye.
FO300009605	Don't let me keep you.
FO300009606	It's time for me to go.
FO300009607	Let's talk about something else.
FO300009608	All right. What's on your mind?
FO300009609	I've disarmed the bomb, Burke. That thing will never explode now.
FO300009610	You did WHAT? Are you out of your goddamned mind? Do you have any idea how long we've pained to put this plan into motion?
FO300009611	Weeks of preparation, destroyed. No words of mine can express my utter contempt for you.
FO300009612	You have made a very poor error in judgment, my friend. One day... one day it WILL come back to haunt you.
FO300009613	Messing with that bomb seems pretty technical. What if I can't do it?
FO300009614	Lack the aptitude, you mean? You're not re-wiring the thing, just attaching the Pulse Charge to the detonator.
FO300009615	If you get stumped, talk to Leo Stahl. He might have something to help you concentrate. He's got a bit of a reputation.
FO300009616	I thought you knew what you were doing. If it's just nerves, maybe some chems will help. But if you can't handle it, don't go fiddling with it!
FO300009617	I'm not sure I can disarm the bomb.
FO300009618	We're talking a lot of innocent lives here, Burke. Can I warn them?
FO300009619	Absolutely not! The place, the people, they're one and the same! Sacrifices for a nobler future.
FO300009620	I assure you, they are worth ten times as much in death, as they are in life.
FO300009621	You're out of your mind, Burke. There's no way I'm helping you.
FO300009622	Now that is a disappointment. Well, if you change your mind, the offer still stands. Good day.
FO300009623	I'm beginning to lose my patience with you. But the offer still stands should you come to your senses.
FO300009624	I'm not going to do it.
FO300009625	All right, Mister Burke. I'll do it. Megaton will burn.
FO300009626	Excellent! I had a feeling about you. Here's the Fusion Pulse Charge. It needs to be installed inside the bomb.
FO300009627	When it's done, meet me at Tenpenny Tower. It's southwest of here, well out of harm's way. You can't miss it. Questions?
FO300009628	Oh. I see. I didn't realize Megaton had any guardian beyond its intrepid sheriff. Very well, then. I'll take my leave, as you suggested.
FO300009629	Throw in an extra 500 caps, and you've got yourself a deal.
FO300009630	Well played!  An extra 500 caps, in addition to the base fee, when Megaton lies in ruins. Here's the Fusion Pulse Charge. Place it in the bomb.
FO300009631	When it's done, meet me at Tenpenny Tower. It's southwest of here, well out of harm's way. You can't miss it. Any questions?
FO300009632	You're a sick man, Burke. This conversation's over.
FO300009633	It seems I have misjudged you. Very well. I'll simply find someone with more entrepreneurial spirit. Good day.
FO300009634	No, no, I'm merely a recruiter. YOU get to have the real fun.
FO300009635	The undetonated atomic bomb for which this town is named is still very much alive. All it needs is a little motivation.
FO300009636	I have in my possession a Fusion Pulse Charge. Once rigged to the bomb, it will be detonated, by you, at a secure location. Easy money, my friend.
FO300009637	Go on. I'm listening.
FO300009638	The undetonated atomic bomb for which this town is named is still very much alive. All it needs is a little motivation.
FO300009639	You'll rig it to the bomb. Then you'll get paid. Handsomely. What do you say?
FO300009640	If you've got a point, make it.
FO300009641	As you wish. I'm looking to employ an individual with no ties to Megaton, no interest in its future.
FO300009642	It does?
FO300009643	Don't you see? You're a free agent! You've no ties here, no interest in this settlement's affairs. Megaton means nothing to you!
FO300009644	Finally, someone with a modicum of civility and common sense.
FO300009645	You have no connections here. No interest in this cesspool's affairs, or fate. You could assist us in erasing this little accident off the map.
FO300009646	Why don't you fight back?
FO300009647	Yeah sure. I'll just go and take all of them out by myself. What are you, crazy?
FO300009648	As soon as they roll into town, I lock my doors just like everyone else. We could really use some assistance here.
FO300009649	Tell me about Allistair Tenpenny.
FO300009650	He owns this building. We get our caps from him, and don't you forget it.
FO300009651	A very well dressed gentleman, when he bothers to get dressed. He hardly ever leaves his penthouse suite.
FO300009652	He stays in his penthouse suite most of the time. So long as we pay the rent, he lets us live here.
FO300009653	He's the landlord, although you hardly ever see him. I had to treat him once for bed sores, if you know what I mean.
FO300009654	Every day it's the same thing. The man has no imagination with his meals.
FO300009655	But it's his building, so everyday I make that damned "Iguana Bits sandwich, no salt, with a peeled pear on the side. Send it up to the penthouse."
FO300009656	He is the right lord and master of Tenpenny Tower.
FO300009657	Or at least that's what my files say.
FO300009658	It's impolite for a gentleman to talk about himself. But I'd hope this magnificent tower would speak volumes.
FO300009659	Tell me about yourself, Mr. Tenpenny.
FO300009660	What can you tell me about Tenpenny Tower?
FO300009661	It's named after Allistair Tenpenny, who runs this building. Got a bunch of rich guys that pay him to live in it.
FO300009662	We're here to make sure that people like you don't mess up his deal.
FO300009663	I'm not a tour guide.
FO300009664	Some might say Tenpenny Tower is my crowning achievement. But no! No no! My dear boy, it is just the beginning!
FO300009665	Quite a tower you have here, Mr. Tenpenny.
FO300009666	Some might say that Tenpenny Tower is my crowning achievement. But no! No no! My dear girl, it is just the beginning!
FO300009667	Quite a tower you have here, Mr. Tenpenny.
FO300009668	I'd like to do business with you.
FO300009669	I only carry the finest garments.
FO300009670	My Boutique has many unique items for the discerning customer.
FO300009671	What are you in the mood for?
FO300009672	Can I get something to eat?
FO300009673	Enjoy the holiday discount, compliments of Mister Tenpenny!
FO300009674	I'm thirsty.
FO300009675	And what will our most distinguished guest be having today?
FO300009676	I'm thirsty.
FO300009677	I have an excellent selection of thirst quenchers.
FO300009678	I'm thirsty.
FO300009679	I have some first aid supplies I can sell.
FO300009680	I guess we could do a little trading. Here's what I got.
FO300009681	You got an armament supply? Want to do some trade?
FO300009682	Here's what I got.
FO300009683	You got an armament supply? Want to do some trade?
FO300009684	Unfortunately you can't force a man's attentions.
FO300009685	Especially if he is a priest with a thick skull.
FO300009686	Well, I'm not giving up. I just know we're made for each other.
FO300009687	I have some ant queen pheromones that might do the trick.
FO300009688	Really? Oh, thank you! I just know I can seduce Diego with this.
FO300009689	Then he'll have to marry me. We'll be so happy!
FO300009690	Yeah, right. I don't think I could get him drunk enough to do that.
FO300009691	I wish I had some ant pheromones. Trinnie says they would make any man lose control.
FO300009692	You're a woman. Just seduce him.
FO300009693	Okay, I believe you. I was just curious about it.
FO300009694	I forgive you. More importantly, God forgives you.
FO300009695	If you don't stop seeing her, I'll tell Father Clifford about it.
FO300009696	I swear to you, our relationship is chaste. I am only her friend.
FO300009697	However, I must confess, I have not done all I could. I am sorely tempted.
FO300009698	You have given me new resolve. I will tell Angela we cannot see each other again. Even as friends.
FO300009699	Ah! Diego! What have you done!
FO300009700	He has forced my hand. I cannot let him be a priest now.
FO300009701	This may be the end of the faith if I cannot find another acolyte.
FO300009702	It's just a rumor. I'd ask Diego about it first.
FO300009703	Of course, you're right. It's not like you saw it with your own eyes. I'm sure it's just gossip.
FO300009704	Sorry I overreacted. So many of my hopes for the church lie in Diego that it would be devastating to have him leave.
FO300009705	Suicide is a sin. Kill yourself, and your soul won't go to Heaven.
FO300009706	That's what Father Clifford says. I'm not sure I believe that. I'll think about it.
FO300009707	What about Ted? He needs guidance. A father figure.
FO300009708	Ted Strayer? I suppose I could talk to him. He is kind of a lost boy.
FO300009709	Thank you, stranger.
FO300009710	You're right. I've failed everyone. Even my family.
FO300009711	Real courage is living. Only cowards commit suicide.
FO300009712	You may be right, but I have nothing to live for.
FO300009713	If that's what you really want, I'll help you.
FO300009714	Thank you. A quick shove should do it.
FO300009715	This letter is all Ian has left of his old life. Allow me to give it to him.
FO300009716	Your words impress me, human. Perhaps I misjudged you when we first met.
FO300009717	If you wish to speak to Ian, you are free to do so. Here is the code to the area in which he is meditating.
FO300009718	I find this all very hard to believe.
FO300009719	The hunger that drives us must be kept in check. It is one of the most difficult things to teach.
FO300009720	Ian lost control because no one was around to guide him. His own family was alien to him.
FO300009721	He had a moment of weakness, and it was fatal.
FO300009722	Ian shouldn't be here. He has family that misses him.
FO300009723	WE are his family. If he were to leave, how can you be certain he would not feel the same way about us?
FO300009724	Ian is at a critical moment in his life right now. After all that occurred in Arefu, he is scared and confused.
FO300009725	It would be ill advised for me to allow you to speak to him while he decides what he wants to do.
FO300009726	You do this by teaching them that they're mythical beings?
FO300009727	Now you disappoint me. You need to open your mind and think for a moment before you pass judgment.
FO300009728	I have reined in their cravings and taught them to eat not of the flesh, but to drink of the blood.
FO300009729	Most importantly, they have a Family. A place where their quirks are tolerated and understood.
FO300009730	I still say you're cannibals.
FO300009731	It saddens me to think that your failure to understand us could be my fault. If that is the case, allow me to enlighten you.
FO300009732	We call ourselves vampires; a brotherhood that honorably stretches back thousands of years.
FO300009733	If I said vampires, and you said I was right, we'd both be crazy.
FO300009734	Do you think I believe I can turn into a bat and fly away? Of course not. Do I cast my image in a mirror? Absolutely.
FO300009735	Now ask me if I believe these individuals from every corner of the Wasteland need me to give them a sense of purpose and identity.
FO300009736	I have shown these people the ways of the vampire. I've provided them shelter, organization and a sense of belonging.
FO300009737	Please, help me understand your Laws.
FO300009738	Indeed? Tell me what you've learned from the Laws. What do you think we are?
FO300009739	I think I finally understand what you people are.
FO300009740	We are the remnants of society, cast aside like the picked bones of a hunter's feast.
FO300009741	Men of science would call us cannibals, eaters of human flesh. Society labels us as monsters, demons and the unclean.
FO300009742	I've brought my flock here to shelter under the sun-baked sand of the Wasteland to keep them safe and teach them my ways.
FO300009743	I don't understand what you people are.
FO300009744	No, I can see it in your eyes. You do not yet possess that spark of realization. Continue speaking to my people.
FO300009745	So, are you ready to explain to me just what you people are?
FO300009746	Each of us is required to speak one of the Laws when we hold our ceremonies. I say the First Law.
FO300009747	"Feast not on the flesh; consume only the blood. This is our strength."
FO300009748	When we all gather in the common area, Vance gives his speeches and then we each have like a Law to say.
FO300009749	Mine is "Bear not the child; welcome only the exile. This is our fate." Kinda cool, huh?
FO300009750	When Vance stands on that balcony and starts mouthing off like some kind of preacher, it makes me wanna puke.
FO300009751	But if I wanna keep this place stocked I gotta have his permission, so I learned his Fifth Law.
FO300009752	"Kill not our kindred; slay only the enemy. This is our justice." Pretty silly if you ask me.
FO300009753	Well, usually everyone has a rule or something they have to yell out at our gang meetings.
FO300009754	Since I guard the door all the time, I don't have to do that. I mean, they're good laws and all, but it feels stupid yelling that stuff out loud.
FO300009755	Well, Vance makes each of us remember a rule, and when we all gather in the common area, we have to say it out loud. Kinda weird.
FO300009756	So, my Law is the fourth one. "Seek not the sun's light; embrace only the shadows. This is our refuge."
FO300009757	I don't have time for chit-chat. Tell me where Ian is. Now!
FO300009758	Sigh. Short temper. So typical of a human.
FO300009759	Is there no end to your hostility? Your kind have never accepted us. So be it.
FO300009760	All you rely on is violence to further your means. If that is what you seek, I will be happy to provide it!
FO300009761	You people murdered his parents!
FO300009762	Murder is a very strong word, my friend. Do you consider it murder when a hunter stalks his prey in order to put food on the table?
FO300009763	The Family must do what it can to survive, and Ian provided us the way.
FO300009764	Ian is at a critical moment in his life right now. After all that occurred in Arefu, he is scared and confused.
FO300009765	This may sound odd, but is there a trainyard outside Arefu?
FO300009766	Well, yeah actually. Meresti Trainyard almost due east of here.
FO300009767	The Wests had bite marks on their necks. Mean anything to you?
FO300009768	What!? The Family must be a pack of cannibals!
FO300009769	Oh, this is all I needed right now. What am I going to do? They'll keep coming back until all of us are dead if they think we're food.
FO300009770	I discovered that the Wests had bite marks on their necks made by a human!
FO300009771	Bite marks on their necks? That's the strangest thing I've ever heard. The Family must have attack dogs with them or something.
FO300009772	Oh, this is all I needed right now. What am I going to do? They'll keep coming back until all of us are dead!
FO300009773	Did you know the Wests are dead?
FO300009774	Thanks kid. You're all right.
FO300009775	Don't worry, Evan. I'll figure out what happened to the Wests.
FO300009776	The Family must have gotten to them in the last attack! Sons of bitches!
FO300009777	Damn it! If only we had more men, we could stand up to them. I'm sick of them terrorizing this town.
FO300009778	Everyone else seems fine.
FO300009779	The Family must have gotten to them in the last attack! Sons of bitches!
FO300009780	Damn it! If only we had more men, we could stand up to them. I'm sick of them terrorizing this town.
FO300009781	Check the rest of the town. Make sure I'm not the only one left.
FO300009782	What?! Oh my God!
FO300009783	King has to do something about this now! Tell him to get off his ass and hunt those bastards down!
FO300009784	Son of a bitch! I knew the Family were going to cross the line. It was only a matter of time.
FO300009785	Maybe it's time I cut my losses and ran, but it just isn't fair. I made my home here, why should I have to leave?
FO300009786	Dead tired I bet from the square dance in the barn last night! What a time we had!
FO300009787	No. I'm done with you.
FO300009788	Acknowledged. Hitting the rack!
FO300009789	Yes.
FO300009790	Acknowledged.
FO300009791	Initiate triage protocol.
FO300009792	Medical procedures initiated. Administering treatment. Please stand still.
FO300009793	If Lucy is still alive I bet she misses you.
FO300009794	She does? If she cared so much, why did she leave when she did?
FO300009795	No, I'm sorry. Vance and the Family are the only ones that could possibly understand what I'm going through.
FO300009796	I'm sorry, Ian, but your parents are dead.
FO300009797	You think I don't know that? You think I don't know what I did?!
FO300009798	RadioGoodbye
FO300009799	Roof access to the Statesman Hotel is only through the adjoining hospital. Please hurry! Butcher out.
FO300009800	We will continually broadcast as often as we can, but I'm afraid we don't have much time left. Butcher out.
FO300009801	Message repeats.
FO300009802	Until next time, this is President Eden, signing off.
FO300009803	Until we meet again, this is President Eden, signing off.
FO300009804	Until next time, this is John Henry Eden, signing off.
FO300009805	Until we meet again, this is John Henry Eden, signing off.
FO300009806	Until next time, this is your President, John Henry Eden, signing off.
FO300009807	Until we meet again, this is your President, John Henry Eden, signing off.
FO300009808	So you know how to find one?
FO300009809	Possibly. I'm afraid I won't be able to assist you directly; the news Doctor Li has brought will require me to be elsewhere.
FO300009810	I can, however, give you access to an old pre-war computer from Vault-Tec. It may have the information you need.
FO300009811	You'll find the terminal in the archives in the A ring.
FO300009812	I'm not going with you.
FO300009813	Are you sure? I'm sure we could use your help.
FO300009814	If you change your mind, you can always meet up with us along the way. If nothing else, come see me once we're set up.
FO300009815	Won't that be dangerous?
FO300009816	Probably. But we have to try, don't we? It's too important to the people of the Wasteland to let fear stop us now.
FO300009817	We need to get moving right away. Are you coming with us?
FO300009818	You have to go now? Can't this wait?
FO300009819	After twenty long years, I finally have a chance to make things right, to finish what I started so long ago.
FO300009820	I owe this to Madison. I owe it to your mother. No, I can't wait another moment. Are you coming with us?
FO300009821	All right. Let's get going.
FO300009822	That's my boy!
FO300009823	It'll be good to work side-by-side with you, son.
FO300009824	That's my girl!
FO300009825	It'll be good to work side-by-side with you, honey.
FO300009826	What do we need to do right now?
FO300009827	You just need to power up the mainframe, and we can see what there is to see.
FO300009828	What should I be doing now?
FO300009829	You need to replace the fuses that shorted out in the flooding. Once they're in, the automatic doors will work and we can reach the mainframe.
FO300009830	What should I be doing now?
FO300009831	Right. The flooding shorted out some of the fuse boxes downstairs, including one that controls some of the automatic doors.
FO300009832	Here, take these fuses. The box is back down in the sub-basement, near the eastern end of the level.
FO300009833	Once the fuses are replaced, you'll be able to get to the mainframe.
FO300009834	You said something about fuses?
FO300009835	The flood control pumps, remember? Without those working, we can't restore power to the mainframe.
FO300009836	I can use the intercom system to talk you through reaching them.
FO300009837	What should I be doing now?
FO300009838	The Project was abandoned shortly after you were born. Things have deteriorated here since then, and there's been some flooding.
FO300009839	I'll need you to get to the Flood Control Pumps and activate them so we can clear out the water and reach the mainframe.
FO300009840	What's our goal here?
FO300009841	Eventually, I think we can get the whole facility up and running. But we'll need a G.E.C.K. for that.
FO300009842	So we need to find a G.E.C.K. I'm hoping the Project's computer will have information on where we can locate one.
FO300009843	No way. I'm not doing this.
FO300009844	All right, all right. I won't push. But please reconsider.
FO300009845	I said I'm not doing this, and I meant it.
FO300009846	Honey, I know things are moving a bit quickly, and I'm sure you have some conflicting feelings about helping me after what's happened.
FO300009847	If you need to take a moment, that's fine. I'll be waiting for you.
FO300009848	Son, I know things are moving a bit quickly, and I'm sure you have some conflicting feelings about helping me after what's happened.
FO300009849	If you need to take a moment, that's fine. I'll be waiting for you.
FO300009850	Okay. Where do I need to go?
FO300009851	The automatic doors sealed when the flooding occurred, so you'll have to use the access tunnels to reach the pumps.
FO300009852	Why me? Can't someone else do it?
FO300009853	In a word? No. Everyone else has specific tasks to complete as the power comes back online.
FO300009854	Don't worry. I'll guide you along the way as best I can using the intercom system. You'll do fine.
FO300009855	I don't know, maybe.
FO300009856	Well fine! Go away then!
FO300009857	Here, maybe this will shut you up. <Give a Nuka-Cola Quantum.>
FO300009858	Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! A real Quantum! Yummie yum yum!
FO300009859	Okay, I guess I can talk to you some more. Just be nicer next time!
FO300009860	Now, do you want to take the tour?
FO300009861	Yeah. I'm sorry, Sierra. Here's a Nuka-Cola Quantum for you!
FO300009862	Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! A real Quantum! Yummie yum yum!
FO300009863	Okay, I guess I can talk to you some more. Just be nicer next time!
FO300009864	Now, do you want to take the tour?
FO300009865	No way! I'm not scouring the Wasteland for some stupid soft drink!
FO300009866	Hey! It isn't just some stupid soft drink!
FO300009867	It's only the most delicious thing man has ever conceived!
FO300009868	Glowing pee? That sounds like dangerous stuff!
FO300009869	Oh no! Not at all!
FO300009870	Nuka-Cola Quantum was made under the supervision of the Food and Drug Association. They would NEVER let harmful products end up in stores!
FO300009871	Let me think about this, Sierra.
FO300009872	Okay. But I bet you'll be back!
FO300009873	I think I've had just about enough of this.
FO300009874	You can never have enough of the refreshing taste of Nuka-Cola! He he he!
FO300009875	I think I'd rather be smacked in the head with a blunt instrument.
FO300009876	What an odd way to make music, I'll have to try it sometime!
FO300009877	Well if you don't want to take the tour, what are you doing here?
FO300009878	Yeah, I guess you're right. It isn't that bad.
FO300009879	See, I knew you were smart the moment you walked in here!
FO300009880	So, enough with the small talk. Are you ready for the tour?
FO300009881	I'm sorry, Garza. I wish there was more we could do.
FO300009882	I insist. You have greater problems to worry about. I will be all right. Now please, go.
FO300009883	We can't just leave you here. It isn't right.
FO300009884	You know what to do, Doctor Li. You must go on without me.
FO300009885	Garza, I'm sorry. I don't know what to do.
FO300009886	Vault101DadHolotape
FO300009887	But this is our life now, so I guess I'd better get used to it. The Overseer who runs the place is an overbearing bully, but I've dealt with worse.
FO300009888	The prisoner from Vault 101 is to be shot on sight. I repeat, shot on sight. This is an order!
FO300009889	Attention! This is Colonel Autumn! You are hereby ordered to ignore the President's previous directive.
FO300009890	The code is "Priority Override, Authorization code 420-03-20-9"
FO300009891	...
FO300009892	Root level access granted. Override O-923. Authorization J-512. Self-destruct sequence initialized.
FO300009893	Civilian is requested to secure FEV vial and vacate the facility at once.
FO300009894	You're right. I was just kidding.
FO300009895	Even I appreciate a good joke, but I'm afraid that was in rather poor taste.
FO300009896	Guess what? I know your self-destruct code.
FO300009897	Oh come now, bluffing's not really your style, is it?
FO300009898	And there's certainly no need to threaten me.
FO300009899	MQ09AutumnHolotape
FO300009900	I'm not entirely sure Eden can be trusted. And I think he knows I don't trust him.
FO300009901	But I don't think he knows I have the emergency destruct sequence for his console.
FO300009902	What's in this vial of yours?
FO300009903	Ah, the Forced Evolutionary Virus. Such a long and sordid history. The FEV in this vial is a far cry from what it was originally created to be.
FO300009904	Yet little of that matters now. What does matter is that the virus contained in that vial will cause the eradication of all mutations.
FO300009905	That's all I wanted to know.
FO300009906	Is there anything else?
FO300009907	This explains why I've only heard your voice until now.
FO300009908	Very astute! Many people are content with a reassuring voice of authority, and never question the lack of public appearances.
FO300009909	You, however, are not "many people." You are unique, and that is why I have asked you here. I think there are some things we should discuss.
FO300009910	You're a computer! I should have guessed as much!
FO300009911	How very open-minded of you. Kudos for embracing the reality of the situation, rather than railing against it.
FO300009912	Let's get to brass tacks, shall we? There are some things I'd like to talk to you about.
FO300009913	So, you grew up here too?
FO300009914	Sure did. Can't say that I'm proud of it, though. It was all just normal. It's what we all did. I didn't ever think much about it.
FO300009915	I married Gladys, just like every boy in Andale married the girl closest to his age. We had Linda and she grew up to marry Jack.
FO300009916	But what could I do? I'm just an old man. But you ended it. Bless you.
FO300009917	What's going to happen to the kids?
FO300009918	They'll stay here with me and I'll raise them myself. It's a shame that they have to grow up without their parents.
FO300009919	But, to tell you the truth, it's a lot better than growing up with their parents, everything considered.
FO300009920	Better an orphan than a cannibal, I guess?
FO300009921	Now what will you do?
FO300009922	It'll be hard goin', but we'll do the best we can.
FO300009923	I just hope that one day, these kids'll grow up to go some good for this place, after all the evil that's been done here.
FO300009924	Do you like living in Andale?
FO300009925	It's okay, I guess. There aren't a lot of kids around here and no one who comes to visit stays around long.
FO300009926	Dad says it could be worse; that there are starving kids in other places. But still, I wish I had more kids to play with.
FO300009927	What's going on around Andale?
FO300009928	My dad says that it's going to rain soon, do you think it will?
FO300009929	I dunno. Nothing, I guess. Old Man Harris won't come out of his house again.
FO300009930	What do you think of the other people in Andale?
FO300009931	Hey, did you know that I'm going to marry Junior Smith when I'm old enough? I know, he doesn't like girls now, but mommy says that he'll come around.
FO300009932	What do you think of Junior Smith?
FO300009933	Command protocol delta-five-three. Disengage security program.
FO300009934	Command accepted. Security program disengaged.
FO300009935	Yes, fellow employee? What can I do for you on this wonderful day?
FO300009936	MQ05AutumnSpeech
FO300009937	Very well. Give me a few moments to bring the system online.
FO300009938	Then you will immediately hand over all materials related to this project, and aid us in making it operational at once.
FO300009939	Yes, Colonel. I'll do whatever you want; there's no need for more violence.
FO300009940	I suggest you comply immediately, sir, in order to prevent any more incidents. Are we clear?
FO300009941	Sir, this is the last time I am going to repeat myself. Stand down at once, and turn over control of this facility.
FO300009942	Furthermore, you are to assist Enclave scientists in assuming control of the administration and operation of this facility at once.
FO300009943	Then I repeat, sir, that you are hereby instructed to immediately hand over all materials related to the purifier.
FO300009944	Yes, I'm responsible for this project.
FO300009945	Am I to assume, sir, that you are in charge?
FO300009946	That's quite impossible. This is a private project; the Enclave has no authority here. I'm going to have to ask you to leave at once.
FO300009947	The person in charge is to step forward immediately, and turn over all materials related to this project.
FO300009948	By the authority of the President, this facility is now under United States government control.
FO300009949	Lead the way. Let's not waste any time.
FO300009950	There's an old tunnel that will lead us out of here, to someplace safe. We used it as an evacuation route once before, but that was a long time ago.
FO300009951	I hope everyone remembers how to get there. There isn't time to round everyone up. Come on, follow me. And hurry!
FO300009952	How do we get out of here?
FO300009953	We used an old, abandoned tunnel as an escape route once before, many years ago. Everyone should know how to find it.
FO300009954	We need to get there right now. Let's go.
FO300009955	I'm not leaving my father in there!
FO300009956	There's nothing anyone can do for him now. The radiation levels in there are lethal. You'd die the same way he did.
FO300009957	We need to get out of here, now!
FO300009958	God forbid I should be upset that twice now my work has been screwed over by your father.
FO300009959	And, to make things worse, this time he brings his snot-nosed kid along for the ride.
FO300009960	He's just trying to do the right thing.
FO300009961	Sure, sure. No matter that he disappears for almost twenty years, leaving us all hanging. It's not like we have lives or anything.
FO300009962	Anything I should know about this place?
FO300009963	Doctor Li has been waiting to come back here for twenty years, okay? Twenty. That's a long time.
FO300009964	This is important. We can't afford to screw it up.
FO300009965	The Brotherhood of Steel was overwhelmed by mutants here. Be careful they do not overwhelm you; I am sure some still lurk within the tunnels.
FO300009966	Besides the fact that you shouldn't be here?
FO300009967	Don't touch anything you're not told to. There's enough to do around here without having to clean up after you.
FO300009968	I'd steer clear of the water if I were you. It's seeping in from the Tidal Basin, which means it's radioactive.
FO300009969	Do you think Project Purity will ever work again?
FO300009970	I sure hope so, or it's just going to crush Doctor Li completely. Especially after your father came back and all.
FO300009971	I have faith in your father. With the knowledge he's gained, we stand a better chance than we ever have.
FO300009972	If Doctor Li says it will work, then it will be so.
FO300009973	The hell do you care? You showed up here what, five minutes ago, and now you're strutting around like you own the place?
FO300009974	You shouldn't even be here. Why don't you go do whatever it is you're supposed to be doing and leave me alone.
FO300009975	Not if you keep asking me stupid questions.
FO300009976	I don't see why not. Between Doctor Li and your dad, we've got the best minds on the job. They can do just about anything.
FO300009977	Yeah, I think we'll be up and running in no time.
FO300009978	What's your story?
FO300009979	I've been with Doctor Li for about ten years now. She needed an assistant, and I needed something to do.
FO300009980	It was either this or wind up dead in a ditch someplace, y'know?
FO300009981	I have worked for Doctor Li for many years. She has been good to me, helped me through some difficult times.
FO300009982	I had little purpose in my life before she helped me. So now I help her in return. I am no scientist, but I am good with machines.
FO300009983	Unlike some people around here, I stuck with Doctor Li through it all. I was the last one to leave when we finally gave up.
FO300009984	Now your daddy shows up out of the blue, and suddenly I have to drop everything to come back and help pick up the pieces.
FO300009985	Who, me? Oh, nothing special. I grew up in Rivet City, and was always interested in what the scientists were doing there.
FO300009986	Doctor Li took me under her wing, and taught me everything I know. Dan and I were out in the field when we got the call to come back.
FO300009987	You're right. What do you need me to do?
FO300009988	We need to stick together, but we need to move quickly. We'll follow behind you, all right? Let's get moving.
FO300009989	You're not in charge here.
FO300009990	I'm responsible for these people, and with James gone, I'm responsible for Project Purity.
FO300009991	You're not getting into the Citadel without me, so I suggest you start listening to what I have to say.
FO300009992	What do you mean, "If we can make it"?
FO300009993	We're underground. No one's been down here for a long time. Odds are we're not alone. Understand me?
FO300009994	We don't have time to waste. We need to get moving.
FO300009995	Wait here. I'll scout ahead.
FO300009996	Are you sure? I don't want to stay in one place for too long.
FO300009997	Let's get moving. Follow me.
FO300009998	We'll be right behind you. Be careful.
FO300009999	You have a plan?
FO300010000	We need to keep everyone together, and we need to get through this tunnel as quickly as possible.
FO300010001	We're not safe until we reach the other side. You should stay close, and we'll follow behind you.
FO300010002	What's up ahead? You seem nervous.
FO300010003	I don't know what's ahead. That's the problem.
FO300010004	No one has used these tunnels in years. But we can't stay put; the Enclave will find us eventually. We have to get moving.
FO300010005	Excuse me?
FO300010006	You heard me. We need you right now. You're the only one here with any amount of combat experience.
FO300010007	We've got the Enclave behind us and who-knows-what ahead of us. If we're going to make it through here, we need your help.
FO300010008	Where to now?
FO300010009	This tunnel leads to the Citadel, the Brotherhood of Steel's fortress. We should be safe there, if we can make it.
FO300010010	MQ05LiEndSpeech
FO300010011	Lyons! I know you're in there! I know you can hear me! You open this goddamn door right now!
FO300010012	I'm sorry, ma'am. No unauthorized civilians allowed inside the Citadel. You'll have to leave now.
FO300010013	I am Doctor Madison Li. I have people with me in need of shelter. You must allow us access at once.
FO300010014	I believe I can handle things from here.
FO300010015	And she was passionate. About life, about love. But most of all, most of all she was passionate about you.
FO300010016	And so! Time for you to stop stalling and get to class! Please, honey, please take these achievement tests seriously.
FO300010017	The last thing I need is you mother's ghost haunting me because her only child became a garbage burner.
FO300010018	And she was passionate. About life, about love. But most of all, most of all she was passionate about you.
FO300010019	And so! Time for you to stop stalling and get to class! Please, son, please take these achievement tests seriously.
FO300010020	The last thing I need is your mother's ghost haunting me because her only child became a garbage burner.
FO300010021	Is it true, Dad? Was everyone born in the Vault?
FO300010022	That's what the Overseer says, isn't it?
FO300010023	He's not about to let anyone else in, so I guess that's how it'll have to be.
FO300010024	You're here now, and it's a hell of a lot better than being up there. All your mother and I ever wanted was for you to be safe, and you're safe here.
FO300010025	Do we have to die in the Vault? Can't we ever leave?
FO300010026	That's not the way it works. And it won't do to go around asking questions like that. Especially not around the Overseer.
FO300010027	I want to tell you something now. It's important, so listen closely: this place, this Vault... it's not perfect, I know. But it is your home.
FO300010028	You're safe here. Stay on the Overseer's good side, and you always will be. You understand? You need to appreciate all you have.
FO300010029	Because what's up there, on the outside, that's not the life I want for you, and it's not what your mother wanted for you, either.
FO300010030	Anything I need to know about the G.O.A.T.?
FO300010031	The Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test. G.O.A.T.! Everyone here in the Vault takes it when they're sixteen.
FO300010032	Helps to figure out what sort of job you'll have here in Vault 101 when you get a bit older. So, pay attention and try not to fall asleep.
FO300010033	You know what the Overseer says: "We're born in the Vault. We die in the Vault."
FO300010034	"Each is tested to determine their abilities, that they may work for the betterment of all Vault residents." Sound familiar?
FO300010035	But, I'm sick. Really. <Lie.>
FO300010036	No, you're not. Really.
FO300010037	When I started studying medicine, one of the first things I learned was how to spot a kid playing sick to get out of taking a test.
FO300010038	You'll do fine. It's not so bad. Everyone has to take it when they're sixteen. I had to, you have to, and so does everyone else.
FO300010039	And most everyone makes it through without a scratch.
FO300010040	If you say so, Dad.
FO300010041	Hey, it's not my call. Those are the rules.
FO300010042	You're sixteen now, so this year you take the G.O.A.T.
FO300010043	Come on. It's not so bad. Everyone has to take it. You'll do just fine.
FO300010044	Fine. Let's go.
FO300010045	Whatever you say, Butch. You're the boss! Tunnel Snakes rule!
FO300010046	C'mon, Tunnel Snakes. This little bitch isn't worth our time.
FO300010047	CG03WallyLeavingTalk
FO300010048	I'm not finished with you, either, twerp.
FO300010049	This ain't over, daddy's girl.
FO300010050	Fine. Let's go. I was done here, anyway.
FO300010051	Don't know who put you in charge. I say we're done. Let's go, Paul.
FO300010052	Done? We're not done! I say when we're done.
FO300010053	We're done here.
FO300010054	I've heard you do anything he tells you. And I mean anything.
FO300010055	What? What kind of shit is that? No one talks that way about Wally Mack!
FO300010056	He's not the boss of me! Nobody's the boss of me! I'm out of here.
FO300010057	If you say so.
FO300010058	I do say so. Buzz off.
FO300010059	I don't follow anyone. Wally Mack is his own man. And the Tunnel Snakes is where I belong.
FO300010060	Why? You think Butch is in charge? Is that what people are saying? Because it's a load of shit, if that's what they're saying.
FO300010061	Why do you listen to Butch?
FO300010062	Because he's my pal. My brother. All us Tunnel Snakes are brothers. Birth to earth. Womb to tomb.
FO300010063	Mostly because Tunnel Snakes rule!
FO300010064	None of your business. Because Butch said so. And what Butch says, goes.
FO300010065	Tunnel Snakes rule!
FO300010066	Yeah. I got that. Why are you picking on Amata?
FO300010067	Stay out of this. It's Tunnel Snake business.
FO300010068	Me and Butch, we're just having some fun with this chick.
FO300010069	You have a problem with Amata?
FO300010070	Don't want to get involved? Thanks a lot.
FO300010071	Fine. Go. I don't need your help, anyway.
FO300010072	Fight my own battles? Sure. Three against one is fair. What's gotten into you?
FO300010073	I thought we were friends. Turns out you're just as big a jerk as these idiots.
FO300010074	I'll see if I can talk some sense into them.
FO300010075	Thanks. You've always been a good friend. Try talking to Butch. They'll all do whatever he says.
FO300010076	If you keep messing with her, the Overseer is going to come down on your gang.
FO300010077	Maybe you're right. We can deal with her later.
FO300010078	Her weight, huh? I can see why.
FO300010079	You're okay, pipsqueak. Now, run along before you get hurt.
FO300010080	Leave her alone, or you'll answer to me.
FO300010081	Whoa, take it easy. No need to go all psycho on me again. We were just joking with her.
FO300010082	And who are you? Her boyfriend? Ha!
FO300010083	Keep talking like that, boy, and we'll send you back to your daddy with a few broken bones for him to fix.
FO300010084	And who are you? Her girlfriend? Ha! Should have known.
FO300010085	Keep talking like that, girl, and we'll send you back to your daddy with a few broken bones for him to fix.
FO300010086	Hey, it's none of my business.
FO300010087	You've got that right. Just keep moving, and maybe we won't come looking for you next.
FO300010088	Leave Tunnel Snake business to the Tunnel Snakes.
FO300010089	Looks like you're having fun.
FO300010090	Damn right. And you'll stay out of our way, if you know what's good for you.
FO300010091	No one messes with the Tunnel Snakes. Especially not this stuck up little daddy's girl.
FO300010092	What's going on here?
FO300010093	None of your business, kid. Get outta here before you get hurt.
FO300010094	If you mess with the Tunnel Snakes, you're asking for it. Got me?
FO300010095	CG03AmayaTalk
FO300010096	I'm not fat!
FO300010097	But, I'm not fat!
FO300010098	Stop it! Stop it!
FO300010099	Leave me alone!
FO300010100	Stay away from me!
FO300010101	Back off, Butch!
FO300010102	Shut up, Butch!
FO300010103	Go away, you stupid Tunnel Snakes!
FO300010104	I'm not scared of you, Wally Mack!
FO300010105	Leave me alone, Wally!
FO300010106	Help!
FO300010107	Get away from me!
FO300010108	CG03BullyTalk
FO300010109	Amata's not fat, she's just 5 feet too short.
FO300010110	We're gonna run out of rations if Amata keeps eating.
FO300010111	Gonna go cry to your daddy, fatass?
FO300010112	You put on a couple of pounds, Amata?
FO300010113	What's the matter. Daddy's girl gonna cry?
FO300010114	I can show you a real tunnel snake, Amata.
FO300010115	You think you're special because your daddy is the Overseer?
FO300010116	Hey, fatso, I got something you can put in your mouth!
FO300010117	Watch out! Wide load coming through!
FO300010118	Hey, lardass!
FO300010119	She thinks she's better than us!
FO300010120	Tell her, Butch!
FO300010121	She's nothing, Butch!
FO300010122	Amata's got more chins than a Chinese phone book!
FO300010123	Amata's so fat, her clothes have stretch marks!
FO300010124	Amata's so fat, she broke her leg and gravy poured out!
FO300010125	Careful. Amata might eat us!
FO300010126	Been spending some extra time in the diner, Amata?
FO300010127	Daddy's girl! Daddy's girl!
FO300010128	Show it to her, Butch!
FO300010129	Okay. I'll be back soon.
FO300010130	That's the spirit!
FO300010131	Tunnel Snakes? You guys are some kind of gang, is that it?
FO300010132	Only the baddest gang in Vault 101. Like you don't know. We rule this Vault, and what we say goes.
FO300010133	You'll stay out of our way, if you know what's good for you.
FO300010134	That's us. And we rule!
FO300010135	No one messes with the Tunnel Snakes. Or they have to answer to Butch. And Wally. You don't want to be on their bad sides. Trust me.
FO300010136	What's all this about the Tunnel Snakes?
FO300010137	What? You mouthing off, spaz? Everyone knows the Tunnel Snakes!
FO300010138	We rule this Vault, and we don't take shit from nobody. Not you, not her, and not her daddy, the Overseer.
FO300010139	Should I have heard of the Tunnel Snakes?
FO300010140	A bunch of idiots, if you ask me. They think they're so tough, with their "gang."
FO300010141	All they ever do is hang around and cause trouble. They've got it in for me because my father is the Overseer. Like that's my fault!
FO300010142	Butch and his friends bothering you again?
FO300010143	Can't think of anything. Butch says this little bitch is blabbing to her daddy about us Tunnel Snakes. We can't have that.
FO300010144	Because we're the Tunnel Snakes. And we rule!
FO300010145	Don't you have something better to do?
FO300010146	Why don't you mind your own business? Last I checked, you weren't a Tunnel Snake.
FO300010147	Run along, kid. Before Butch and I decide you're a problem.
FO300010148	Why don't you leave her alone?
FO300010149	Never mind. Let's just get back to work.
FO300010150	All right.
FO300010151	I think I understand. I'm glad we talked.
FO300010152	So am I, my love. While this isn't what I had in mind, it's good to have you with me.
FO300010153	So am I, son. While this isn't what I had in mind, it's good to have you with me.
FO300010154	Just forget it. Let's get this over with.
FO300010155	I hope that you can understand why I've done the things that I've done. The last thing I want is to lose my daughter.
FO300010156	I hope that you can understand why I've done the things that I've done. The last thing I want is to lose my son.
FO300010157	Helping people? What about helping your own son?
FO300010158	I can understand that you're angry. You have a right to be.
FO300010159	Perhaps the choice I made wasn't the right one. At the time, I thought I was doing what was best for you.
FO300010160	Helpling people? What about helping your own daughter?
FO300010161	I can understand that you're angry. You have a right to be.
FO300010162	Perhaps the choice I made wasn't the right one. At the time, I thought I was doing what was best for you.
FO300010163	Is this about mom? Are you trying so hard because of what happened to her?
FO300010164	Oh, my child. If only you could have known how much it meant to her. She believed in the work we were doing, and was so determined to see it through.
FO300010165	She gave up so much for the project. We all did, and I don't want that to have been for nothing.
FO300010166	Oh, my son. If only you could have known how much it meant to her. She believed in the work we were doing, and was so determined to see it through.
FO300010167	She gave up so much for the project. We all did, and I don't want that to have been for nothing.
FO300010168	Can't we just go back to the Vault, back to the way things were?
FO300010169	Somehow I don't think the Overseer would agree to that.
FO300010170	What's done is done. But if we succeed, if we can make Project Purity a reality, we can create a new life for ourselves out here.
FO300010171	Why would you put yourself at risk like this? You have some sort of death wish?
FO300010172	What? No. No, of course not!
FO300010173	Just what are you trying to do here?
FO300010174	There's so much history here. So much time and energy spent on this place, because it could help so many people.
FO300010175	And now, after all these years, there's a chance to finish it. To see it through to the end, and help all the people of the Capital Wasteland.
FO300010176	How could you leave me like that? What the hell were you thinking?
FO300010177	I wanted you to be safe. I didn't want this for you -- a life out here in this godforsaken warzone.
FO300010178	I couldn't tell you what I was doing because I didn't want you following me.
FO300010179	A plan which clearly was not as successful as I imagined it would be.
FO300010180	Can we just talk for a minute?
FO300010181	Of course, honey. What's on your mind?
FO300010182	Of course, son. What's on your mind?
FO300010183	What's on your mind?
FO300010184	I wanted to talk to you about some things.
FO300010185	I'll need some details before I can decide.
FO300010186	Hey, you're pretty smart for a Wastelander!
FO300010187	I need you to deliver a message to my family. They live in a small settlement northwest of here. If you bring it, I'm sure my dad will pay you.
FO300010188	I'll tell you more if you agree. Please, I could really use your help.
FO300010189	So you just disappear without saying a word?
FO300010190	I had thought that after my escape, the Overseer would seal the vault. You'd have no choice to stay behind.
FO300010191	I suppose I underestimated how resourceful you are.
FO300010192	You could have told me you were leaving.
FO300010193	Oh, be honest. Can you really say you wouldn't have tried to come with me if you knew?
FO300010194	I told you, I wanted a different life for you. I had hoped the Overseer would seal the Vault, making it impossible for you to leave.
FO300010195	You really think you can do this? Make this thing work?
FO300010196	I wouldn't be here if I didn't. With what I've learned from Doctor Braun, I know it can work.
FO300010197	That's why it's so important we find a G.E.C.K. as soon as possible. It's the key to Project Purity.
FO300010198	Why would you throw away the life we had?
FO300010199	You have to understand, the Vault wasn't for me. It was for you. To make sure my daughter grew up someplace safe, away from all this.
FO300010200	I didn't want you to leave. I wanted you to stay there, to grow up and live your life in safety.
FO300010201	You have to understand, the Vault wasn't for me. It was for you. To make sure my son grew up someplace safe, away from all this.
FO300010202	I didn't want you to leave. I wanted you to stay there, to grow up and live your life in safety.
FO300010203	You know what? Fuck you, Dad.
FO300010204	I'm sorry you feel that way.
FO300010205	How could abandoning me be the right choice?
FO300010206	For almost twenty years now, I've done everything I can to see that you have a good life.
FO300010207	The Vault wasn't perfect, to be sure, but it was the safest place in the Wasteland. That's why I took you there in the first place.
FO300010208	I didn't see it as abandoning you. I saw it as moving on, knowing you were safe.
FO300010209	I know it's painful, but let's talk about what happened in Arefu.
FO300010210	It actually kinda makes me feel better to talk about it. Go ahead.
FO300010211	What can I do to help?
FO300010212	I don't have sufficient medical supplies with me, or else this wouldn't be a problem. If you have any Stimpaks, I would ask that you hand them over.
FO300010213	We don't have time for this shit. Let's go!
FO300010214	I said I will NOT leave him. Now look around for any sort of medical supplies. There must be something we can put to use.
FO300010215	Let's go. This is no time to sit down.
FO300010216	I'm afraid I can't do that.
FO300010217	Doctor Li can tell you. It's my heart.
FO300010218	Garza is in need of medical attention immediately. He has a heart condition. I will not leave him behind.
FO300010219	Stop here? Are you crazy?
FO300010220	What's the matter? Are you all right?
FO300010221	Doctor Li, she can explain.
FO300010222	Garza has a heart condition. He needs medicine, or he may not make it. I'm not moving until he gets the medicine he needs.
FO300010223	Why would we stop now?
FO300010224	MQ05GarzaSick
FO300010225	Do I look like someone that you want to blow off?
FO300010226	Okay, tough guy. Say what's on your mind.
FO300010227	Well now, looks like she's got some spice. Say what's on your mind.
FO300010228	I'm sorry to interrupt, Andy. I just had a few questions.
FO300010229	[sighs] I suppose. Just make it quick.
FO300010230	I'm sorry to interrupt, Andy. I just had a few questions.
FO300010231	Wait here a minute.
FO300010232	Oh no you don't. You have the Declaration on you now. I'm going to stick to you like glue until we reach Abraham Washington.
FO300010233	Sure thing, but don't get too far ahead of me.
FO300010234	You got it. Just don't stray too far.
FO300010235	Yep. Don't go too far.
FO300010236	Whoa, whoa. Slow down. Let me think a minute.
FO300010237	Slow huh? Okay. Hurry though, I don't want to wait here for more of those things to crack open my skull.
FO300010238	What's our next move?
FO300010239	Let's head for Rivet City. It's a bit of a hike, but I want to get back there so I can start spending my caps!
FO300010240	Don't worry, I know exactly where it is... we should make it in one piece.
FO300010241	Let's head for Rivet City. It's a bit of a hike, but I want to get back there so I can start spending my caps!
FO300010242	Let's get the hell out of here. Time to get paid, then get drunk!
FO300010243	There should be an elevator to the upper level somewhere around here.
FO300010244	What else, let's get the document!
FO300010245	Look, if you think you can reason with him, go right ahead. My advice? Blow its damn head off. It's obviously malfunctioning.
FO300010246	Either way, I'll let you decide. Anything that gets us closer to the prize is fine by me.
FO300010247	What do you make of this "Button Gwinnett" robot?
FO300010248	Inside the Archives Strongroom should be the Declaration. I have no idea what's inside. That's the only part of the plans I never found.
FO300010249	If you can find and disable the turret generator, most of the turrets in the East Wing should go offline.
FO300010250	If you're any good at hacking or lockpicking, we can get through the maintenance doors or utility gates.
FO300010251	There should be shortcuts like it all over the East Wing.
FO300010252	They kept the Declaration in the Archives Strongroom that's at the end of the East wing here. We'll have to make our way to it.
FO300010253	It looks like we're in the Sub-Basement hub. I think the door we want is the one to the East. Never been this far in, only saw it on blueprints.
FO300010254	There's a cargo lift right here in the Rotunda. It should take us directly down to the lower levels.
FO300010255	I was hacking the system right before we were attacked. The code should be "We the People."
FO300010256	Nope, not interested.
FO300010257	Fine by me. I've waited this long to get the Declaration, I can wait 'til someone smarter comes along.
FO300010258	Don't try and follow me, not that you could.
FO300010259	Sure, let's team up.
FO300010260	Smart move.
FO300010261	Okay, the Declaration is secured in the Archives Strongroom underground.
FO300010262	There's a concealed cargo lift right here in the center of the rotunda. I've spent a few days hacking the lock with my remote terminal.
FO300010263	When you're ready, punch in the password and let's get going.
FO300010264	What are you proposing?
FO300010265	Simple. We pool our resources, grab the Declaration then make for Rivet City and split the reward.
FO300010266	I've studied the plans to this place, so without me you're going to go in circles. What do you say?
FO300010267	I don't work with strangers.
FO300010268	Okay cowboy, go ahead and blunder through the place. You'll never make it to the Declaration let alone back to Rivet City for the reward.
FO300010269	You have no idea what type of resistance your up against. If I were you, I'd take every extra gun I could.
FO300010270	I've studied the plans to this place, so without me you're going to go in circles. What do you say?
FO300010271	What do you mean "fellow relic hunter"?
FO300010272	Good old Abraham Washington sent you on the same suicide mission he sent me on.
FO300010273	Only problem is, you're not going to get it without my help.
FO300010274	Yep. I sure am.
FO300010275	Ho ho. Do I detect a hint of wit? Rare to run into that in the Capital Wastes.
FO300010276	Sorry, I'm being a complete asshole. I'm Sydney. It's good to meet a fellow relic hunter.
FO300010277	Thanks, you're not so bad yourself.
FO300010278	Well, with what I do for a living, you need to be.
FO300010279	Sorry, I'm being a complete asshole. I'm Sydney. It's good to meet a fellow relic hunter.
FO300010280	Can we stop beating around the bush, please? What's the reward?
FO300010281	Sorry, my mind tends to wander. I would see to it you receive a worthwhile trade.
FO300010282	I have in my possession the only known schematic for the creation of something called the Railway Rifle.
FO300010283	Bring me the Declaration, and it's yours.
FO300010284	Can the speech, Abe. I need to get paid.
FO300010285	Heroes of the United States will receive rewards befitting their rank, I can assure you. Your prize will be no different.
FO300010286	I have in my possession the only known schematic for the creation of something called the Railway Rifle.
FO300010287	Bring me the Declaration, and it's yours.
FO300010288	I suppose that's good enough for me.
FO300010289	Marvelous! Then you've decided?
FO300010290	What could be more important than completing my collection? Without that document, what is the U.S.A. now? Nothing!
FO300010291	Oh well. Please come back when you change your mind. I know you will.
FO300010292	Not now. Maybe another time.
FO300010293	A famous man once said that patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish.
FO300010294	I've waited this long, I suppose I can wait until someone else comes along to accept my offer.
FO300010295	I'd love to be a part of history, and bring you the Declaration.
FO300010296	Excellent! You won't regret it, I promise you! Imagine, you are taking part in another chapter of American History. I envy you.
FO300010297	You can find the Declaration of Independence in the ruins of the National Archives.
FO300010298	What does the Declaration of Independence look like?
FO300010299	It's no more than two and a half feet tall and two feet wide. If you find it, you should be able to roll it up carefully.
FO300010300	Yes, I was proud to participate in the signing of the Declaration of Independence along with fifty five of my fellow freedom fighters.
FO300010301	It was an honor to have my signature among those of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.
FO300010302	Except maybe for Hancock, that show off.
FO300010303	Did you sign the Declaration of Independence?
FO300010304	Can you show me how to get to the National Archives on my map?
FO300010305	In the D.C. Ruins you'll find the National Archives. Or what's left of it anyway.
FO300010306	The building should contain the document in a protective glass case. Be careful, the place is swarming with Super Mutants.
FO300010307	Here, let me pinpoint its location for you.
FO300010308	Skip the history lesson, professor.
FO300010309	A man of few words. Very well.
FO300010310	Get the Declaration of Independence to me intact and I'll pay you well for your time. What do you say?
FO300010311	A woman of few words. Very well.
FO300010312	Get the Declaration of Independence to me intact and I'll pay you well for your time. What do you say?
FO300010313	Indeed I do. Without the Declaration, the rest of these relics are almost meaningless. I must have it!
FO300010314	Acquire the document for me, and you'll be awarded most handsomely. What do you think?
FO300010315	Maybe later. I've got better things to do right now.
FO300010316	Shame. Very well, you're free to look around but with your level of patience I suspect you'll become bored rather quickly.
FO300010317	Your rude tone leads me to believe you aren't interested in a little proposal I have for you.
FO300010318	Now, will you hear me out? If not, we don't have much more to talk about.
FO300010319	All right, I'll bite. Which document is missing?
FO300010320	In 1776, the Second Judgmental Congress got together and adopted a document drafted by none other than Thomas Jefferson himself.
FO300010321	It was the day the United States of America earned its name and secured its place in history.
FO300010322	This magnificent achievement took form in the Declaration of Independence.
FO300010323	It's an interesting collection of garbage.
FO300010324	One man's garbage is another's treasure trove. Don't underestimate these documents. They may not look like much, but their value is immeasurable.
FO300010325	Or would be anyway, if only I possessed one more item.
FO300010326	Yes, it's an interesting collection indeed.
FO300010327	Ah, a fellow scholar I see!
FO300010328	Each of the documents in this room tells a small but important story about the history of the United States of America.
FO300010329	Unfortunately, the greatest prize of all is missing from the collection.
FO300010330	What's it like living at Tenpenny Tower?
FO300010331	Well, I feel a lot safer now that those Ghouls have stopped bothering us. That's for sure.
FO300010332	Our new neighbors aren't so bad after all. And they have big appetites, so that's good for the cafe!
FO300010333	It's swell. Those new neighbors of ours like to drink almost as much as I do… and boy, do they have some real good stories!
FO300010334	It's fine now that those Ghouls are taken care of. I've been treating less cases related to frazzled nerves and upset stomachs.
FO300010335	It's great. Now that we have a real comrade around here to handle things. I'm appointing a special Security Subcommittee and I want you to chair it!
FO300010336	Things are going well, I'd say. We've all learned a thing or two about what makes a real community. Don't you think, comrade?
FO300010337	It's a lot better now with those Ghouls out of the picture!
FO300010338	I guess I don't mind those Ghouls as much as I thought I would.
FO300010339	Business is still good!
FO300010340	Those Ghouls are disgusting, so I just spend all my time up here.
FO300010341	Now everyone's calmed down and back to their old selves. Not that I cared much for them to begin with, but they've stopped all the Ghoul foolishness.
FO300010342	They really are quite ignorant here. But where else could I retire and fit all my trophies?
FO300010343	I'm surprised by my fellow tenants. I used to think they were all closed minded idiots. Turns out they aren't so bad after all.
FO300010344	Beats the Wasteland and dirty tunnels, that's for damn sure!
FO300010345	It's wonderful. Roy was right. This is the way to live!
FO300010346	It's weird actually. I used to vacation here before the bombs dropped. Used to be a resort for the wealthy and powerful.
FO300010347	I never thought I'd be the one fighting to get in here. Guess way back it used to be a plantation. Ironic isn't it?
FO300010348	Can you help me find something else?
FO300010349	Certainly.
FO300010350	I'm actually just looking for some food.
FO300010351	Well, in that case I recommend the Brass Lantern. It's directly across from the Church. You can't miss it.
FO300010352	Even still, I cannot aid you on this path with a clear conscience.
FO300010353	Tell me about the Church of Atom.
FO300010354	Yes? What would you like to know?
FO300010355	I've been looking for you.
FO300010356	I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I'm sure Evan King is pretty pissed right about now.
FO300010357	I bet he has the entire town out looking for me. He's worse than my parents.
FO300010358	So what are you doing in the Metro tunnels?
FO300010359	Biding our time, making plans, getting ready. Tenpenny and his pack of elitist wannabes can't keep us out of that tower forever.
FO300010360	We got rights. And we'll take them if they aren't given to us.
FO300010361	Biding our time, making plans, getting ready. Tenpenny and his pack of elitist wannabes can't keep us out of that tower forever.
FO300010362	We got rights. And we'll take them if they aren't given to us.
FO300010363	What about it?
FO300010364	Let's talk about Tenpenny.
FO300010365	What about it?
FO300010366	Let's talk about Tenpenny.
FO300010367	Roy is coming up with a plan to get us into that tower. Tenpenny's. Says it's only a matter of time.
FO300010368	He's strong like that. He never gives up. The kind of guy who makes things happen, Roy is. That's why the others follow him.
FO300010369	Me, I just like the way he looks at me. Makes me feel pretty again. I'd go anywhere with him.
FO300010370	I've been stomping around with Roy and his gang of misfits. Roy's a no nonsense, take no prisoners kinda guy.
FO300010371	He heard about this Tenpenny asshole, and now he's trying to get us in that tower. He's hatching some kind of plan to kill all those bigot bastards.
FO300010372	Believe it or not, I used to vacation there.
FO300010373	Right. I thought so. I'm warning you. I don't take shit from no one.
FO300010374	You eat people's brains, right? So what's it like being a zombie?
FO300010375	You got balls. Real big ones. I'll assume you're kidding 'cause no one shit talks me and lives.
FO300010376	We Ghouls are just like the rest of you: Shit out of luck and doing our best to make it.
FO300010377	Whatever.
FO300010378	Uh-huh. Didn't think so.
FO300010379	You're the prejudiced asshole, not me. So you're ugly. Big deal.
FO300010380	Maybe I misjudged. Pardons. So yeah, people treat us like shit. But it just makes us stronger.
FO300010381	Otherwise we ain't no different than anyone else that had the misfortune to live past infancy.
FO300010382	No, really. I mean it. I don't care if you're a Ghoul or not.
FO300010383	Uh-huh? Fine, whatever. Being a Ghoul ain't anything worse than any other thing somebody's got to deal with.
FO300010384	Like your stupidity, for example. You can't help it. You were born stupid, or dropped on your head as a kid.
FO300010385	Either way it ain't nothing you can change. So you deal with it.
FO300010386	I didn't mean to offend. I'm not prejudiced.
FO300010387	Sure, whatever you say. You pretentious two-faced asshole.
FO300010388	So tell me, what's it like being a Ghoul?
FO300010389	I used to be pretty, you know! Everyone used to come around all the time!
FO300010390	I wasn't always like this. I was a goddamn scientist. We were doing great things. Amazing things.
FO300010391	Sure sacrifices were required. Some people got hurt. But we were making real progress. But then those goddamn bombs dropped.
FO300010392	Karma's a real bitch. You'd be wise to remember that.
FO300010393	Not much to say? That's good. It'll keep you out of trouble. Be warned: don't cause me or mine no problems, or I'll end you.
FO300010394	<Say nothing.>
FO300010395	Am I babbling again? I tend to do that when I'm nervous...
FO300010396	<Say nothing.>
FO300010397	Apathy is the death of the soul. It's better to be angry as hell! It keeps things interesting anyway.
FO300010398	Whatever.
FO300010399	WarringtonGreetingChoiceBad
FO300010400	Listen good. I'll say this only once. I can respect a man's privacy. But I don't put up with bullshit.
FO300010401	Keep to yourself and we'll be fine. Cause any trouble for me or mine, and I'll end you. We understand each other?
FO300010402	Mind your fucking business, that's who.
FO300010403	Have you met Roy? He's killed lots of people before.  I'm his gal. He protects me. So better not try anything.
FO300010404	I'm trouble. That's all you need to know.
FO300010405	It's your own funeral then. Just remember that when you die, you die alone. Then you just rot until some jackal comes and snacks on you.
FO300010406	I can handle myself.
FO300010407	WarringtonGreetingChoiceGood
FO300010408	Harmless? Well, you're lucky I don't stick you and take your shit. Watch yourself, we don't take kindly to strangers, 'specially sweet-talking ones.
FO300010409	You got nothing to worry about. I'm harmless.
FO300010410	Am I babbling again? Roy tells me I shouldn't do that.
FO300010411	Nice to meet you, Bessie. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
FO300010412	Just passing through? That's no way to live your life. You need a purpose. A goal.
FO300010413	It's the only thing that keeps you from realizing how meaningless this shit-filled existence really is.
FO300010414	Just passing through.
FO300010415	Let's talk about something else.
FO300010416	As you wish.
FO300010417	What the hell is wrong with you people?
FO300010418	It's a shame that you so easily mock us without even knowing our doctrine.
FO300010419	Even knowing the truth, you continue to mock us. How very, very sad.
FO300010420	Why do you worship the bomb?
FO300010421	Those who were called to Atom during the Great Division were very fortunate. They were permitted to aid in the process of Atom's creation.
FO300010422	We seek the same, both in symbol and in fact and the "bomb", as you call it, represents Atom's capacity for creation.
FO300010423	We kneel before it and ask that Atom call us to aid him. We pray that out of our meager bodies, he will create new life.
FO300010424	What do you believe?
FO300010425	The Church of the Children of Atom is based on the idea that each single atomic mass in all of creation contains within it an entire universe.
FO300010426	Occasionally, a divine event occurs and trillions upon trillions of new universes are created. The last such event took place here, 200 years ago.
FO300010427	Where most of the lost children of Atom see that event as simple war and devastation, we see creation and unification in Atom's Glow.
FO300010428	I found him. He's with the Family.
FO300010429	What? Those gangers? I knew if he got mixed up with the wrong crowd this could happen! Why didn't I do anything to stop him?
FO300010430	Please, just go. Don't say anything, don't look back. Just go.
FO300010431	I haven't found him. <Lie.>
FO300010432	Please, just go. Don't say anything, don't look back. Just go.
FO300010433	I found him. He's safe.
FO300010434	Thank goodness! You have no idea how worried I was... I haven't even slept well since you left.
FO300010435	Thanks for bringing me the news, you've really cheered me up!
FO300010436	I give up. Fine, stay here and cry.
FO300010437	Hmph. Just like Vance said. Humans will never understand us; just sit on their high horse and ridicule us.
FO300010438	Well fine. You can judge us any way you see fit, but one thing's certain... I'm not leaving.
FO300010439	Now get the hell out of my room.
FO300010440	Look, Ian. I know loss, too. I know it hurts. But staying here isn't the answer.
FO300010441	I'm a mutant; a freak! The only person I was ever able to talk to was my sister Lucy, and she's gone.
FO300010442	No one gives a shit about me except Vance and the Family. Can't you understand that?
FO300010443	I'm a mutant, a fucking freak! The only person I was ever able to talk to was my sister Lucy, and she's gone.
FO300010444	No one gives a shit about me except Vance and the Family. Can't you understand that?
FO300010445	You're a bitch to find.
FO300010446	Well, maybe that's because I don't want to be found.
FO300010447	Why the heck are you looking for me anyway?
FO300010448	MS13Collar3
FO300010449	Money? I'm a slave? Where's this Paradise Falls? This collar will explode won't it? I've heard about these things.
FO300010450	You're a slave now. Get going to Paradise Falls. Sorry. I needed the money.
FO300010451	Oh that sounds bad. I need my head. Where's Paradise Falls?
FO300010452	I'm afraid your head will explode if you don't get to Paradise Falls. Sorry.
FO300010453	Huh? Paradise Falls? Where's that?
FO300010454	Go to Paradise Falls before that collar explodes. Sorry!
FO300010455	You're a slave now. Nothing personal. Get to Paradise Falls if you want to live.
FO300010456	MS13Collar2
FO300010457	You hiding anything in your pockets?
FO300010458	My stuff? Okay.
FO300010459	Give me all your stuff!
FO300010460	Huh? Sure, take a look.
FO300010461	You'd better not be holding out on me! Show me what you're carrying.
FO300010462	Okay, okay. Here.
FO300010463	MS13Collar1
FO300010464	I'm a slave now?!?! Don't kill me please! I'm going!
FO300010465	Start running to Paradise Falls or your head'll explode! That collar is a bomb.
FO300010466	You're a slave now! Better get to Paradise Falls before your head explodes!
FO300010467	You get moving to Paradise Falls, or that fucking collar will explode!
FO300010468	The Slavers? I'm a slave? How did this happen?!
FO300010469	Give my regards to the Slavers in Paradise Falls. Move, or your head goes boom!
FO300010470	MS13Mezzed3
FO300010471	What? Oh. Okay.
FO300010472	You're just a little dazed. Walk it off. You'll be okay soon.
FO300010473	You're staring into space. You feeling okay? Wake up!
FO300010474	Who are you again?
FO300010475	Let's hope there's no permanent brain damage. Run along now!
FO300010476	Have you been drinking? You'd better go get some rest.
FO300010477	MS13Mezzed2
FO300010478	Huh? A slave collar? What are you talking about?
FO300010479	Damn. I wish I had a slave collar. I could totally make you a slave right now.
FO300010480	Here. Put on this collar -- I mean, necklace. I think it'll look good on you.
FO300010481	I'm going to put this collar on you. Just hold real still for a minute.
FO300010482	This is too easy. Here, put this collar on.
FO300010483	I have some friends who want to meet you. Here, put this collar on.
FO300010484	MS13Mezzed1
FO300010485	You look exhausted. Let me carry your stuff for a while.
FO300010486	I think you've got something that belongs to me. I need it back.
FO300010487	I want to show you a magic trick. You mind if I borrow some of your stuff?
FO300010488	There's a thief about, and you seem distracted.  I'll hold onto your gear.
FO300010489	I'm sorry, but it's for the good of everyone. Now let's go.
FO300010490	I can't believe James raised a daughter like you. You disgust me.
FO300010491	I can't believe James raised a son like you. You disgust me.
FO300010492	No reason to hang around now, is there? Move it.
FO300010493	You're inhuman! I won't forget this.
FO300010494	You're only going to slow us down. Maybe you should stay behind.
FO300010495	Yes, you are right. There is no reason to put everyone at risk on my account. Go on without me.
FO300010496	I've changed my mind.
FO300010497	Very well.
FO300010498	Very well.
FO300010499	I'm done donating.
FO300010500	<Donate 100 caps.>
FO300010501	Thank you.
FO300010502	Atom be with you.
FO300010503	Bless you, child.
FO300010504	I appreciate the kind gesture, child, but you don't have enough caps.
FO300010505	<Donate 50 caps.>
FO300010506	Thank you.
FO300010507	Atom be with you.
FO300010508	Bless you, child.
FO300010509	You don't have enough caps.
FO300010510	<Donate 10 caps.>
FO300010511	Thank you.
FO300010512	Atom be with you.
FO300010513	Bless you, child.
FO300010514	I appreciate the gesture, child, but you don't have enough caps.
FO300010515	I'd like to donate to the Church.
FO300010516	Why yes, we do. How much would you like to donate?
FO300010517	Do you accept donations?
FO300010518	Certainly, child. How much help can we expect from you?
FO300010519	Help us, and we in turn help Megaton. How much would you like to donate?
FO300010520	Who's in charge around here?
FO300010521	With both Lucas and Colin dead, it's pretty much a free for all until someone steps up.
FO300010522	Lucas Simms was the only guy we had to keep people in line. With him gone, I guess Moriarty pretty much runs the show around here.
FO300010523	Moriarty thought he was. Not so much anymore, I guess. I'm surprised that Simms never took care of Moriarty himself.
FO300010524	Well, Moriarty thinks he is, but Lucas Simms is the law around here and everyone knows it.
FO300010525	I need a drink.
FO300010526	Anything for you, friend!
FO300010527	How about a drink?
FO300010528	Sure thing.
FO300010529	I used to make Gob take care of this, but what do you need?
FO300010530	I guess now that Gob's gone, someone has to keep you drunks wet.
FO300010531	That's all I needed to know.
FO300010532	Right.
FO300010533	Sure thing, man.
FO300010534	If you say so.
FO300010535	Very well.
FO300010536	Command accepted, pard-ner.
FO300010537	You sure?
FO300010538	Okay!
FO300010539	Right.
FO300010540	Let me know if you need anything else!
FO300010541	Yeah.
FO300010542	No problem, buddy.
FO300010543	Right.
FO300010544	Right.
FO300010545	Right.
FO300010546	Sure thing, honey.
FO300010547	Command accepted.
FO300010548	No problem!
FO300010549	As you wish, child.
FO300010550	Gotcha.
FO300010551	Right.
FO300010552	Right.
FO300010553	I need to buy medical supplies.
FO300010554	Plannin' on goin' out and getting' shot up, eh?
FO300010555	Yeah? What do you need?
FO300010556	Not quite as good as that vault stuff you're used to, but it'll do you.
FO300010557	I'm hurt. I need help, Doc.
FO300010558	Well, you're standing fine, but you could use some switching up. That'll be 50 caps.
FO300010559	Your vitals are fine, but you could use some stitches on those cuts. Tell you what, 50 caps sound good?
FO300010560	Look at you! You're fine! Don't come in here wasting my time with your hypochondria. I've got actual patients to see to.
FO300010561	Oh, you do not. Just suck it up, you big baby.
FO300010562	You know, all things considered, you could be worse off. I can stitch you up for 50 caps.
FO300010563	I'm surprised you made it in here. I can fix you up, but it'll run you 100 caps. What do you say?
FO300010564	Well, you're standing fine, but you could use some switching up. That'll be 50 caps.
FO300010565	Oh, you do not. Just suck it up, you big baby.
FO300010566	I'm surprised you made it in here. I can fix you up, but it'll run you 100 caps. What do you say?
FO300010567	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
FO300010568	That takes a lot of nerve, threatening to bury us all alive and then crawling to me for help. As RJ would say, "Fuck off, mungo."
FO300010569	Can I get some medical treatment?
FO300010570	Sure thing. Run into a bit of trouble out there?
FO300010571	You're lucky you're one of us. I'd be charging you through the nose, otherwise.
FO300010572	Can I get some medical treatment?
FO300010573	Got scraped up a bit out there, huh?
FO300010574	Can I get some medical treatment?
FO300010575	Yeah, but only because you saved three of ours.
FO300010576	Looks like it's just a scrape. I can take care of it for 50 caps.
FO300010577	Can I get some medical treatment?
FO300010578	Okay, but it'll cost you. Every spare cap I get from you is more medicine for these germ-magnets.
FO300010579	Looks like it's just a scrape. I can take care of it for 50 caps.
FO300010580	Can I get some medical treatment?
FO300010581	Yeah, but only because you saved three of ours.
FO300010582	That looks pretty bad. For 75 caps, I can take care of that.
FO300010583	Can I get some medical treatment?
FO300010584	Okay, but it'll cost you. Every spare cap I get from you is more medicine for these germ-magnets.
FO300010585	That looks pretty bad. For 75 caps, I can take care of that.
FO300010586	Can I get some medical treatment?
FO300010587	Yeah, but only because you saved three of ours.
FO300010588	This is going to be tricky. And not at all pleasant. And it'll cost you 100 caps.
FO300010589	Can I get some medical treatment?
FO300010590	Okay, but it'll cost you. Every spare cap I get from you is more medicine for these germ-magnets.
FO300010591	This is going to be tricky. And not at all pleasant. And it'll cost you 100 caps.
FO300010592	Can I get some medical treatment?
FO300010593	Maybe you should have been more careful down here, mungo. You're on your own.
FO300010594	Can I get some medical treatment?
FO300010595	Unless you've got hurt feelings, there's not a damn thing wrong with you. Come back when you've got some injuries that I can earn some money from.
FO300010596	Hey, if you needed help, I'd gladly take your money, but you're just fine, buck-o. Now stop wasting my time.
FO300010597	Let's see, a few Stimpaks and a couple of stitches should get you goin'. And it'll only run you 50 caps.
FO300010598	All right, a few stitches and a couple of bandages should fix you up. Let's call it 50 caps. Sound good?
FO300010599	You know, when I saw you limping in here, I knew that I smelled money. That'll be 100 caps. Or you can just bleed to death. Your choice.
FO300010600	Well, hello, meal ticket. 100 caps. Or I can just wait for you to die and take it.
FO300010601	Don't think because I'm a Ghoul, I'm stupid. You're fine.
FO300010602	Is this a trick question? I don't even see a scratch on you.
FO300010603	Injured... ha! This is just a nick. If you can't tough it out and you want to be fixed up it'll cost you 50 caps.
FO300010604	I'd hesitate to even call this a wound, but if you insist. 50 caps should cover my expenses.
FO300010605	Yeah, you could do with some work. It'll set you back 75 caps, but well worth it.
FO300010606	This is pretty bad, but I've seen worse. Still, it's going to cost 75 caps to get you back on your feet.
FO300010607	Yeah, you look almost as bad as I do. Of course, I'm supposed to look this way and you aren't. 100 caps will do it for my expenses.
FO300010608	Did you get the number of that Brahmin that trampled you? Sheesh! If you want me to stitch you back together, it'll be 100 caps.
FO300010609	For you? No problem. Now, hold still.
FO300010610	Heal me up, Red.
FO300010611	I don't see anything wrong with you.
FO300010612	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
FO300010613	Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though. Let's say 75 caps.
FO300010614	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
FO300010615	Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though. Let's say 75 caps.
FO300010616	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
FO300010617	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
FO300010618	You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for 150 caps.
FO300010619	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
FO300010620	That's disgusting.
FO300010621	Yeah, fuck you too. Whatever, man. I'm used to being treated like shit around here.
FO300010622	You know, it's not so bad.
FO300010623	Nice of you to say so. If you can't be nice, at least pretend, right? Fake it 'till you make it, and all that.
FO300010624	Still though, a fake compliment is better than the usual spit in the face that I get. You're not half bad... for a smoothskin.
FO300010625	I've got nothing against you people.
FO300010626	Well now. That's a surprise! I'm used to every asshole smoothskin in this town giving me shit just because I look like a corpse.
FO300010627	I'm glad to see that there are a few worthwhile people around here.
FO300010628	I know what a Ghoul is. Now get away from me, zombie.
FO300010629	No. What's a ghoul?
FO300010630	Well, not all of us got the chance to hole up in a nice cushy Vault when the bombs fell.
FO300010631	Near as I can tell, we age slower than you. A lot slower. There are even a few Ghouls that were alive during the war.
FO300010632	Of course, with a face like ground Brahmin meat, you can imagine that folks don't take too kindly to us.
FO300010633	I hadn't planned on it.
FO300010634	Well now. That's a surprise! I'm used to every asshole smoothskin in this town giving me shit just because I look like a corpse.
FO300010635	I'm glad to see that there are a few worthwhile people around here.
FO300010636	Are you kidding? Me? Shut the hell up, Ghoul. I'll beat you if I feel like it.
FO300010637	Let me think about it for a moment, my good man.
FO300010638	Stuff it, Ghoul. And stop looking at me.
FO300010639	Gah! Fuck! What are you?
FO300010640	I guess they don't have a lot of Ghouls in the Vault.
FO300010641	Haven't you ever seen a Ghoul before?
FO300010642	What do you do around here?
FO300010643	Me?  I deal with the caravan suppliers. I used to ride with those guys, so they cut me some good deals. Helps keep the town supplied.
FO300010644	I keep these yokels knee deep in booze and poon. They keep me knee deep in caps. It's a fair trade, if you ask me.
FO300010645	I'm the town doc. If it's cut, I sew it up. If it's infected, I cut it off.
FO300010646	Me? I don't do a damn thing. Well, unless you count staying piss drunk and making Moriarty rich as something.
FO300010647	Sure, I'm the best shot in town with a rifle, so everyone comes running to ol' Jericho when the Raiders show up.
FO300010648	But between raids, they're content to take my money and drag me home when I've had too much. Hahaha!
FO300010649	You're goddamn right "nevermind".
FO300010650	Whatever your problem is, I suggest you get over it. Now.
FO300010651	Well, now. That's something I didn't expect. You're scrappy for a little Vault twerp aren't you?
FO300010652	Maybe I had you wrong, kid. You're okay. Now, what did you want to know?
FO300010653	You're joking, right? I mean, I shit bigger than you, kid.
FO300010654	Come back when you've got some fight in you. Until then, save your threats.
FO300010655	Did I miss something? What's your problem with me?
FO300010656	You're from the outside and I've lived too much of my life out there to trust every jackass nobody that wanders in from the Wasteland.
FO300010657	You seem alright though, so I'll cut you a deal. I'll answer your questions so long as you don't give me any more reason to distrust you. Got it?
FO300010658	Here, take this Magnum.
FO300010659	How about a Chinese Pistol?
FO300010660	Hmm, okay. Never used one of these before, but I can probably figure it out.
FO300010661	I can give you a Silenced 10mm Pistol.
FO300010662	I'm not sure the silencer will do me much good, but I'll take it. Thanks.
FO300010663	I've got a 10mm Pistol. Want it?
FO300010664	Sure. Beats having nothing, doesn't it?
FO300010665	I've got a .32 caliber pistol.
FO300010666	I guess it's better than nothing. Thanks.
FO300010667	Sorry, I don't have a pistol on me.
FO300010668	Okay. If you find one, let me know.
FO300010669	Can you help get us through this?
FO300010670	I am feeling better, but not well enough to be of use to you. I apologize.
FO300010671	I can try. I'm not much good with weapons, but if you've got a pistol I can use, I'll do what I can.
FO300010672	What? You're supposed to be the tough one, right? Why don't you take care of it?
FO300010673	You'd better walk away right now.
FO300010674	My father is dead.
FO300010675	I don't have any meds on me, but what if we gave him some Buffout?
FO300010676	If you think this is the best course of action, we'll do it. I hope this isn't a mistake.
FO300010677	Maybe we should just leave him behind. He's slowing us down.
FO300010678	Maybe you're right. Very well. I'll tell him, and then we'll continue.
FO300010679	Let's make this quick.
FO300010680	Forget it. I've got nothing.
FO300010681	Sorry, I guess there isn't anything I can do right now.
FO300010682	We cannot continue to delay here. Something must be done. Is there no medicine to be found?
FO300010683	Here, take some Stimpaks. That should get him through.
FO300010684	Ah, so you do. Give them to Doctor Li, if you please.
FO300010685	I have some Stimpaks here.
FO300010686	Yes, this looks to be enough. He'll need medical attention once we've reached the Citadel, but this will get him there.
FO300010687	Thank you. Give me a moment, and we can continue.
FO300010688	We need to do something about Garza.
FO300010689	I do not have my usual supplies of medicine. I was too hasty in leaving.
FO300010690	Hey. Is there anything I can do to help?
FO300010691	Hey Leo, can you hook me up?
FO300010692	What did I tell you? Not here. Hit me up when I'm away from the restaurant.
FO300010693	What'll it be?
FO300010694	Yeah, sure thing.
FO300010695	What am I gonna say? No? You've got me over a barrel.
FO300010696	What are you doing in here?
FO300010697	Look. Keep your bullshit judgments to yourself, man. Just don't tell Jenny or Andy and we'll be fine.
FO300010698	How's that chem problem treating you?
FO300010699	I just started, but so far... so good.
FO300010700	How's the addiction? Kicked it yet?
FO300010701	Things are pretty hard, but it's getting better. Thanks again, you really talked some sense into me.
FO300010702	How's the addiction? Kicked it yet?
FO300010703	It's not any of your business, remember?
FO300010704	Can you tell me anything about Vault-Tec Headquarters?
FO300010705	From what I gather, it's located in the ruins of D.C. I got the location from one of the supply caravans.
FO300010706	They told me it had extremely high security and something they called a main frame inside.
FO300010707	I'd imagine it's quite dangerous. I'd be careful if I was you.
FO300010708	Is the Stradivarius worth a ton of caps?
FO300010709	I hope you're not thinking of doing anything dishonest. You gave me your word.
FO300010710	How will I know the Stradivarius when I see it?
FO300010711	Well, from my great-great-grandmother's diaries, I have deduced that she had a special pressurized case created for it.
FO300010712	I can't really describe it in detail beyond the case. I've never seen it any other way. I'll know it's the real one when I have it in hand.
FO300010713	You can fool the eyes, but not the ears.
FO300010714	Do you have any information on Vault 92?
FO300010715	I'm sorry, I wish I did. All I know is that Vault-Tec intended it to be a protective environment for the world's musical talent.
FO300010716	When the bombs fell, the Vault was sealed and the rest is a mystery.
FO300010717	Perhaps when you find it, you can find some sort of a record of what occurred inside.
FO300010718	What do you know about the Soil Stradivarius?
FO300010719	Not too much I'm afraid. It was fabricated way back in 1714 by a famous Italian craftsman named Antonio Stradivari.
FO300010720	He had made a bunch of Stradivarius violins actually, and each one was individually named over time to identify them.
FO300010721	Since the bombs fell laying waste to most of the world, it may be safe to say that this could be the last surviving violin of its kind.
FO300010722	Tell me a bit about your great-great-grandmother.
FO300010723	She was quite a special woman. Hilda was her name. Classically trained and exceptionally talented at the violin.
FO300010724	Her pride and joy was her Stradivarius Violin. I can only imagine how exquisite this instrument must have been.
FO300010725	When war reared its head, she was invited by Vault-Tec into Vault 92. They claimed the vault would be dedicated to preserving musical talent.
FO300010726	Happily, she accepted. After she entered Vault 92, the bombs fell, and the story as I know it ends.
FO300010727	So, what am I supposed to do, scour the entire Wasteland asking about violins?
FO300010728	Manners are not your strong suit, eh? I can see this will be a purely business related transaction. So be it.
FO300010729	I'd suggest making your way to Vault-Tec Headquarters in the D.C. Ruins. That would be a good place to begin.
FO300010730	You do? Amazing!
FO300010731	Thank you for this. You have no idea what this means to me.
FO300010732	Good luck to you!
FO300010733	Any idea where Vault 92 is located?
FO300010734	That's the catch. I have no idea where it is.
FO300010735	I'd suggest making your way to Vault-Tec Headquarters in the D.C. Ruins. That would be a good place to begin.
FO300010736	Good luck!
FO300010737	You know, my mother always said a handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains.
FO300010738	However, if you're that eager to get going I'll skip the story. I'm looking for a particular violin called the Soil Stradivarius.
FO300010739	It's located in Vault 92, where my great great grandmother once lived.
FO300010740	Sorry to interrupt, but where can I find the violin?
FO300010741	I'm sorry. I know I tend to ramble. Comes from being lonely.
FO300010742	If you insist. I'll get right to the heart of the matter then. I'm looking for a particular violin, not just any.
FO300010743	The violin you're looking for is called the Soil Stradivarius. It's located in Vault 92, where my great great grandmother once lived.
FO300010744	I need some time to think about it.
FO300010745	I understand. Please don't mistake my evasiveness for mistrust. I am merely being cautious.
FO300010746	Take your time, by all means.
FO300010747	All right. I give you my word I'll do my best to recover a violin for you.
FO300010748	Oh, I don't think I've been this happy in years! As promised, here's the key to the ammunition box. It's right under the radio table.
FO300010749	Before you leave, I have some information that may help you. At least a place to begin.
FO300010750	Oh, I don't think I've been this happy in years!
FO300010751	I have some information that may help you. At least a place to begin.
FO300010752	I'm interested, but what will you give me in return?
FO300010753	As you may have already guessed, I really have nothing of value. Material value, that is.
FO300010754	All I can offer you is the same I offer the caravans that trade with me. The frequency of my radio and the promise of beautiful music.
FO300010755	A violin? That's hardly something that would have survived the war.
FO300010756	Yes, very sad isn't it? Sad to think that no more musical instruments will ever be made the old way ever again.
FO300010757	Sigh. Well, fortunately, I know where perhaps the last real violin in the world exists.
FO300010758	If you give me your word that you will recover it, I will tell you more.
FO300010759	Let's cut to the chase. Is there something you need?
FO300010760	You're very blunt. Not always a good trait, but sometimes it is the best way to get things done.
FO300010761	My trading depends on my violin. Without it, I have nothing to play... no way to make music.
FO300010762	If you can bring me a violin, a better one, I'd feel much more secure.
FO300010763	You built a homemade violin, huh? Impressive.
FO300010764	Thank you. While my husband had his hobbies, I'm afraid mine was making that sorry instrument.
FO300010765	I only wish I could replace it with something better.
FO300010766	Your husband's radio can broadcast across the entire Capital Wasteland?
FO300010767	Yes. My husband was very proud of the setup. He tinkered with that thing for years to get it working.
FO300010768	I've tried to use it to get what I need, but I've never gotten a reply.
FO300010769	That sounds risky. What if the caravan never arrives?
FO300010770	Well, I always have my husband's old radio set to fall back on.
FO300010771	I used it once in an emergency when a group of Raiders was getting a bit too close for comfort to my house.
FO300010772	Otherwise I use it to broadcast my so-called music I play from my homemade violin.
FO300010773	Is there any way I can help?
FO300010774	Now that you mention it, yes there is.
FO300010775	My trading depends on my violin. Without it, I have nothing to play... no way to make music.
FO300010776	If you can bring me a violin, a better one, I'd feel much more secure.
FO300010777	What could you possibly have to trade?
FO300010778	Besides shelter? Well, I offer something in the way of entertainment: I play songs on my homemade violin and people trade me goods.
FO300010779	If not in person, I use my husband's old radio set. The men in the caravan say it keeps their morale up on lonely nights in the Wasteland.
FO300010780	I'm sorry, the heat must be getting to me. My apologies.
FO300010781	Sigh. My husband told me once to always forgive and forget. I suppose I should take that advice now, rest his poor soul.
FO300010782	Consider the apology accepted, and your harsh words forgotten.
FO300010783	I have a lot of patience, but you are really testing it.
FO300010784	However, as I said before, forgive and forget.
FO300010785	Again, I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.
FO300010786	Whatever, grandma. Like I care.
FO300010787	That's just about all I'm going to take from the likes of you!
FO300010788	When you walked in, I thought you were different than the normal riff-raff that crawls out of the sand. I see now that I was wrong.
FO300010789	Come back and talk to me when you decide to be more civil.
FO300010790	That tears it!
FO300010791	I've been calm and patient with you, but you just seem determined not to return in kind. Fine.
FO300010792	Since you only understand rude behavior, allow me to demonstrate some for you. Get the hell out of my house!
FO300010793	I honestly don't give a shit.
FO300010794	Not my problem. Good luck, Sheriff.
FO300010795	You're the one that brought it up. Not me.
FO300010796	100 caps? All right, I'll take a look at it.
FO300010797	Great! Go ahead and see what you can do. Just be careful.
FO300010798	I don't need a reward. I couldn't sleep at night knowing you could all die.
FO300010799	Demolition expertise doesn't come cheap. I want 500 caps.
FO300010800	MS11BombChoiceExplode
FO300010801	I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. Dammit, boy! You picked the wrong man to mess with. Now I've got to put you in the ground.
FO300010802	Actually, Sheriff, I plan on detonating that bomb.
FO300010803	I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. Dammit, girl! You picked the wrong man to mess with. Now I've got to put you in the ground.
FO300010804	Actually, Sheriff, I plan on detonating that bomb.
FO300010805	Let's talk about something else.
FO300010806	All right, shoot.
FO300010807	Know where I can get a drink?
FO300010808	Sure. Head over to Moriarty's for spirits. Or, if you want something to eat, head over to the Brass Lantern.
FO300010809	Does the town have a doctor?
FO300010810	Yep. He's a bit cranky, but he means well. Just make sure there's something actually wrong with you before you bother him.
FO300010811	You'll find him down in the plaza at the bottom of the hill, across the way from The Brass Lantern.
FO300010812	Why is the town called Megaton?
FO300010813	The town's named after the bomb that's sitting in the middle of it. It hasn't gone off. Yet.
FO300010814	Sure. Whatever.
FO300010815	Glad we understand each other.
FO300010816	Surely you haven't severed all contacts?
FO300010817	Oh goodness, no. I have a supply caravan that passes here maybe once a week.
FO300010818	I trade with them for whatever I need and I stock up enough until they return.
FO300010819	I take it you don't get many visitors, then.
FO300010820	Apart from supply caravans, you're the first person to set foot inside my house in a long time.
FO300010821	It's not for lack of trying at this point, mind you. I am just far off the beaten path.
FO300010822	Living in this isolation protects me, but has also made me very lonely.
FO300010823	Oh, your husband's dead? I'm sorry.
FO300010824	That's kind of you to say.
FO300010825	Yes, he's gone. After he built this place, we spent many happy years together.
FO300010826	We decided to cut off contact with the outside world and just depend on each other for comfort and company.
FO300010827	I prefer to keep my business to myself. And I suggest you do the same.
FO300010828	All I've done is offer you safe harbor in my home. No need to get testy with me, young man!
FO300010829	All I've done is offer you safe harbor in my home. No need to get testy with me, young lady!
FO300010830	Exploring.
FO300010831	Honestly, there is nothing much out here. Looking for sand? Rocks? We have plenty of that.
FO300010832	You're welcome to look around this area of course. Don't let me dissuade you. I'm just trying to save you some time.
FO300010833	My husband built this place way out here for a reason, rest his soul.
FO300010834	That's funny, I was about to ask you the same thing.
FO300010835	Oh, don't worry about me. I'm just fine out here.
FO300010836	My husband, rest his poor soul, saw to it that our house was well-protected from the elements and the inhabitants of the Wastes.
FO300010837	That's all I needed.
FO300010838	All right then.
FO300010839	If you say so.
FO300010840	What do you do here?
FO300010841	Colvin thinks he's a better shot. Man's delusional.
FO300010842	So what's your job in the Lyons' Pride?
FO300010843	Hell, I do it all. Recon, demolition, tactical assault. Guess you could say I'm the Pride's jack of all trades.
FO300010844	What's your combat specialization in Lyons' Pride?
FO300010845	Spec ops. Let's leave it at that.
FO300010846	So what's your specialty in the Lyons' Pride?
FO300010847	Yeah, whatever.
FO300010848	That's what I thought.
FO300010849	I've had enough of your shit, Dusk.
FO300010850	Oh? Oh really? Look, I know how you wasters are. You cap a few Radscorpions and think you can walk around like you own the fucking place.
FO300010851	But things work differently around here. You got a problem with that, then you go ahead and meet me in the Lyons' Den after lights out.
FO300010852	I'll solve your little problem the old fashioned way.
FO300010853	It takes some stones to admit a mistake. Maybe you're not so bad, stranger. Tell you what, buy me a drink sometime and we'll call it even.
FO300010854	So, what do you want that's worth pissing me off over?
FO300010855	So it was taught to me, so will you teach it some day. Enough jaw, maggot. Back to work.
FO300010856	The Brother who taught me was a wise man, Initiate. But even will requires practice. Back on point.
FO300010857	I understand. Like you said: no man may be defeated so long as his will to survive remains.
FO300010858	I understand, sir. Like you said: fill your soul with thunder, fight with a heart of steel.
FO300010859	Then you've reached a new level of understanding. Combat does not take place in the brain. It is passion, instinct, and the will to survive.
FO300010860	You're not quite as worthless as you look. Remember, if you overthink combat, you're dead. You have to WANT to survive more than your enemy.
FO300010861	I feel good, sir. I think I get what you were talking about. When I let go and see only the target, the bullets fly right where I want them to go.
FO300010862	I think I understand what you were saying, sir. When I calm down and focus, I don't see anything but the target.
FO300010863	Stop shooting with your eyes and your hand. A soldier kills with his heart. Focus. Lock on to your target and destroy it. Now give it another try.
FO300010864	What do you suggest, sir? No matter what I do, all my shots pull to the left.
FO300010865	If it's not the weapon, then what is it, sir?
FO300010866	Are you kidding me? It's not the weapon, Initiate! Try holding the gun properly instead of firing from the hip like some goddamned cowboy.
FO300010867	The weapon isn't the problem, Initiate. You just shoot like my goddamn grandmother. Actually, strike that, my Mrs. Gunny was a deadeye.
FO300010868	Damn. Sir, I think the sights on my pistol are off. I'm aiming dead on and it keeps firing to the left.
FO300010869	There's something wrong with this weapon, sir. I can hear shells catching in the chamber when I fire.

FO300010874	We must turn our thoughts away from that which is imperfect and impure.
FO300010875	On that vast plain of dust we will raise new cities, and like the Phoenix spread the wings of new life and take flight!
FO300010876	Never wonder for a moment if you are worthy of the benefits you possess. Rather wonder always if you have utilized them to their fullest.
FO300010877	All men were created equal. Not all men remain so.
FO300010878	The beggar must lay down his cup, for a man needs both hands to grasp the future.
FO300010879	Let us release our fears of the past into our hopes for the future!
FO300010880	The poor man wonders why he is poor. The rich man knows why he is rich.
FO300010881	RadioTenpennyTalk
FO300010882	And now it's time for another Tenpenny Truism.
FO300010883	And now a Tenpenny Truism.
FO300010884	Song 2
FO300010885	Song 1
FO300010886	You can trust me. I'm a doctor myself.
FO300010887	All right, I suppose someone with medical training has to have at least a bit of compassion. And maybe you can talk some sense into the boy.
FO300010888	Nice try. Maybe if you actually had some medical training, we could talk about it.
FO300010889	Never mind, then.
FO300010890	Right.
FO300010891	I'm only trying to help, Doc.
FO300010892	All right look, I'm only tellin' you this because you seem like an okay sort and I'm hopin' maybe you can talk some sense into the boy.
FO300010893	You seem very happy. Is there anything I should know?
FO300010894	No, of course not. I am simply glad that our work can continue. James is essential to the project. That's all. Really.
FO300010895	I told you I'd find him.
FO300010896	So you did. I apologize for entertaining the thought of doubting you.
FO300010897	Where do I go from here?
FO300010898	Head towards the northeast end of that level. There's an intercom close to the grate you're looking for.
FO300010899	Head up to the museum level. Use the door at the north end of the level you're on now.
FO300010900	The mainframe room is on the security level, west of the pumps you started earlier.
FO300010901	You're on the right level. Head to the western end, and look for the large automated door.
FO300010902	The fuse box you're looking for is down near the cisterns. Keep heading down.
FO300010903	Come on back up to the main lab. I'll be waiting.
FO300010904	The flood control pump is at the south end of this level.
FO300010905	Keep heading down. There's a staircase at the south end of the level you're on.
FO300010906	I can't really say, since I don't know where you are.
FO300010907	Where am I now?
FO300010908	Right now you're near one of the large cisterns where water from the river is kept until it can be processed.
FO300010909	You're in the security level. It's full of holding tanks for the water as well as our processing equipment and power systems.
FO300010910	You're in what used to be the old museum and gift shop. A lot of the Project's machinery is down there now. We just refer to it as the Museum level.
FO300010911	According to the display, you're somewhere in the substructure. I can't be more specific than that right now.
FO300010912	Tell me about the Church.
FO300010913	For those answers I shall direct you to my husband, Confessor Cromwell.
FO300010914	Can you repair my equipment?
FO300010915	Sorry, I'm closed. Come back tomorrow and we'll talk.
FO300010916	Since you kept me from wasting my time on that book, I had a chance to refine my repair process a bit.
FO300010917	Sure, fine. Whatever.
FO300010918	It's nice to be doing something useful.
FO300010919	Okay, let me scrape the brahmin poop off my hands.
FO300010920	If you've got the caps, I've got the skill.
FO300010921	Unless it's a steaming pile of slag, I'd say yes.
FO300010922	You got caps for me? Then there ain't no problem.
FO300010923	Let me see what you have for sale.
FO300010924	Sorry, I'm closed. Come back tomorrow and we'll talk.
FO300010925	I get a lot more done now that I'm not working on that book. I guess that's something, and that ought to earn you a discount, huh?
FO300010926	Sure thing.
FO300010927	Okay, fine.
FO300010928	What do you need?
FO300010929	Sure thing!
FO300010930	Absolutely!
FO300010931	What do you need?
FO300010932	Thank you, Doctor Li.
FO300010933	If it will help me, then I will take it. I trust you, Doctor Li.
FO300010934	All right. If you're up to it, we'll continue.
FO300010935	Thank you, Doctor Li. I'm feeling better already. Let us continue, and not waste more time here.
FO300010936	Garza, here. This will help you to feel better. Once we reach the Citadel, you'll be fine.
FO300010937	What's got you so spooked?
FO300010938	I mean, they got the guns and they got the muscle. Why don't they just bust down our doors and take us out already?
FO300010939	We're really in a bad way, and could use some help.
FO300010940	What are you, some kind of a wimp?
FO300010941	Look, pal. If you think I'm gonna get my ass shot off playing the hero, you're dead wrong.
FO300010942	If I know they're coming, I lock myself inside like everyone else.  We're really in a bad way, and could use some help.
FO300010943	Where is Doctor Li's lab?
FO300010944	The door on the left goes to the stairwell. From there, just keep heading west.
FO300010945	At the stern. That's the west end to you.
FO300010946	If you don't stop it now, where will it end? It's up to you to do what's right.
FO300010947	Yes, I suppose it is. Very well, you shall have your wish. Once you have left, I will put an end to the Enclave.
FO300010948	I cannot stop Colonel Autumn, however. That much will be up to you.
FO300010949	I suppose, then, that this is goodbye. You'll have to see yourself out; I have preparations to make.
FO300010950	You can't even control your own troops. You're clearly not fit for this.
FO300010951	You can't just decide to take over, and force everyone to follow you.
FO300010952	What alternative would you suggest? Without the Enclave, what will the world do?
FO300010953	This has to end, Eden. You need to destroy yourself and this base.
FO300010954	And why would I do that, when I am clearly the best hope for the people of the Wasteland?
FO300010955	What do you do around here?
FO300010956	I feed my family and I love my wife and daughter, what else more is there to life, stranger?
FO300010957	Family first! And any man who says anything different is saying something wrong. And you should hit that man. With a stick.
FO300010958	I work to feed my family, just like every red-blooded American man should.
FO300010959	Why, a man that can't keep his family fed isn't any kind of man at all, no sir!
FO300010960	What do your parents do?
FO300010961	The same thing that all parents do! My mom cooks and cleans the house and my dad goes to work with Mr. Wilson.
FO300010962	They work in the basement, or sometimes in Mr. Wilson's shed. Dad says that when I'm older, I'll come to work with him and learn the family business!
FO300010963	That's how we do it in the Lyons' Pride, you fucking freaks!
FO300010964	Initiate! Shut it! You'll have your fill of death soon enough.
FO300010965	MQ01LyonsPrideVargas
FO300010966	That's all of 'em.
FO300010967	Looks that way.
FO300010968	Must be a tourist.
FO300010969	Reddin, on me.
FO300010970	You're doing fine. Just follow my lead. No dead heroes today, okay?
FO300010971	Negative.
FO300010972	Roger that. Uglies in our sights.
FO300010973	Yeah, yeah. We'll see.
FO300010974	Now knock that off. You're wasting ammo.
FO300010975	We need to sweep the area. You think those were all the Uglies in D.C.? You take the east side, I'll go west.
FO300010976	Once we're inside, then we'll celebrate.
FO300010977	Reddin! Get out of there! Behemoth!
FO300010978	Reddin!!
FO300010979	God dammit!
FO300010980	Yeah, I know. God DAMMIT!!
FO300010981	Come on. Let's see if they've got anything to drink in this dump.
FO300010982	MQ01LyonsPrideA3
FO300010983	Is this the idiot who blew our ambush?
FO300010984	Let's get back to the checkpoint. See if Colvin has finished clearing the street.
FO300010985	What's the situation?
FO300010986	Good.
FO300010987	Jennings?
FO300010988	Just a stray we picked up. The one that blundered into the Uglies over on 42nd.
FO300010989	All right. It's the usual drill. Reddin, you just do whatever Paladin Vargas says and keep your mouth shut.
FO300010990	Okay, the outpost is just to the south of us. Colvin, you're the eyes.
FO300010991	Vargas, Reddin, secure this building.
FO300010992	And?
FO300010993	OK. We'll flush them out, you pick them off. On my mark.
FO300010994	Go.
FO300010995	Take cover! Behemoth!
FO300010996	Get the Fat Man! We'll try to keep him busy!
FO300010997	It's not your fault, Vargas. Reddin was good enough for the Pride, and she proved it here today.
FO300010998	When we get back to the Citadel, I'll talk to the scribes. Let it be chronicled that Paladin Reddin passed her test.
FO300010999	MQ01LyonsPrideReddin
FO300011000	Yes, ma'am.
FO300011001	So how'd I do, Vargas? I pass my little trial run? Come on, Lyons' Pride needs me and you know it! That Citadel guard duty is such bullshit.
FO300011002	Aw, come on. We just kicked their asses!
FO300011003	Okay, okay.
FO300011004	Now you're talking.
FO300011005	Holy shit! What was that?
FO300011006	Brotherhood mobile unit, report your status.
FO300011007	We're clear out here. Stand down.
FO300011008	Sentinel Lyons? Is that you?
FO300011009	Who else? Always count on my father to send the best.
FO300011010	Ha ha ha! Humble as always, Sarah.
FO300011011	It's great to see you guys. It's been Super Mutant Central over here for days.
FO300011012	You're telling me. Well, another mess cleaned up. We'll sweep the perimeter and be inside shortly.
FO300011013	Copy that.
FO300011014	I found a Brotherhood Holotag. What should I do with it?
FO300011015	Talk to Scribe Jameson. She is our keeper of the Scrolls. She will want to know what you have found.
FO300011016	You have? Oh my. This brings to light a sad affair for the Brotherhood. But perhaps it is something that you can assist us with.
FO300011017	If you have the time, I have an offer for you.
FO300011018	MQ01LyonsPrideColvin
FO300011019	All clear, Sentinel. Five mutants released from their torment. The rest are keeping their heads down.
FO300011020	A new recruit?
FO300011021	Welcome!
FO300011022	You don't need to worry. You're with friends now. We'll see you safely through.
FO300011023	Come with me if you like. We'll have the best view.
FO300011024	I'm in position, sir.
FO300011025	This looks like the main force. Many tormented souls will meet the Maker today. I will pray for forgiveness.
FO300011026	Garza, I'm sorry. We have to go now.
FO300011027	I cannot make it on my own, Doctor Li! I am too weak!
FO300011028	I'm sorry, Garza. I have everyone else to think of as well. If you reach the Citadel, they'll be waiting for you.
FO300011029	Garza, I'm sorry, but we must keep moving. If you can't keep up, I'm afraid we'll have to go on without you.
FO300011030	Here's your violin, Agatha.
FO300011031	You son of a bitch! You know what that thing meant to me!
FO300011032	It was a family heirloom. It belonged rightfully in the hands of a musician, someone to appreciate its value, not to exploit it!
FO300011033	I can't believe you'd stab an old woman in the back like this! Get out! GET OUT OF HERE THIS INSTANT!
FO300011034	Well, actually Agatha, I sold the Stradivarius to someone else.
FO300011035	I can't thank you enough. I wish I had something to give you, a more suitable reward for all your efforts.
FO300011036	All I can give you is the frequency to my radio set. Tune in whenever you feel like listening to the strains of an old woman's violin playing.
FO300011037	I'm still looking. Don't give up on me yet.
FO300011038	Are they Raiders or Slavers?
FO300011039	No way. If they were, you'd be staring at a burned out ghost town. I think the Family are just a bunch of punks.
FO300011040	Well at first they'd do typical gang bullshit. You know, break stuff and make lots of noise, but they always kept their distance.
FO300011041	But this last time, they went too far. They killed all of our Brahmin! I mean, that's our lifeblood out here you know!
FO300011042	I bet you like to look at butts, don't you?
FO300011043	Ha ha ha!
FO300011044	You're all right for a mungo, you know that?
FO300011045	Why don't you come in. I think we can trust you.
FO300011046	Yeah, your mom sure likes it.
FO300011047	Ha ha ha!
FO300011048	You're pretty funny for a mungo.
FO300011049	Why don't you come on in?
FO300011050	Yeah, well at least it doesn't smell as bad as you do.
FO300011051	Ha ha ha!
FO300011052	You're pretty funny for a mungo.
FO300011053	Why don't you come on in?
FO300011054	You know what? Your face looks like my butt.
FO300011055	Oh yeah?
FO300011056	You must like having such a good looking butt.
FO300011057	What's a mungo?
FO300011058	You are, mungo!
FO300011059	You big people. You're all tall and clumsy. Bunch of mungos, and we don't need nothing to do with any of you!
FO300011060	You're pathetic. This isn't even worth our time.
FO300011061	You and your little girlfriend have fun together. We're outta here.
FO300011062	C'mon, Tunnel Snakes! Let's go!
FO300011063	Okay, okay. You win. We'll leave the little girl alone!
FO300011064	You're not worth our time, anyway.
FO300011065	C'mon, Tunnel Snakes. We're outta here.
FO300011066	Choice 2
FO300011067	Fine, screw you.
FO300011068	Take a hike, asshole.
FO300011069	No, no. I am only here to help with moving things, lifting heavy equipment. I am no scientist.
FO300011070	I simply help Doctor Li in whatever way I can.
FO300011071	Really? You sure don't look like a scientist.
FO300011072	Choice 1
FO300011073	Great. If there's anything I can do for you, let me know.
FO300011074	Hey, we're cool.
FO300011075	I help Doctor Li when she needs equipment moved. I am no scientist, I just help with the heavy things.
FO300011076	What do you do around here?
FO300011077	Who are you?
FO300011078	I'm MacCready. I run Little Lamplight, because they made me the mayor. And I don't like strangers. Or mungos.
FO300011079	Doctor Madison Li. I am in charge of the science team based here at Rivet City.
FO300011080	I am Garza. I help Doctor Li here in the lab.
FO300011081	I need a new face, doc.
FO300011082	I'm pretty banged up, doc.
FO300011083	I've changed my mind. I'll live with the pain.
FO300011084	Parts of me are broken, doc.
FO300011085	Can you help me doc?
FO300011086	I'm here to do business with you.
FO300011087	Here's a menu.
FO300011088	Yeah, what do you have?
FO300011089	If I must.
FO300011090	For you, I always offer my best price.
FO300011091	Straight to the point. I like that.
FO300011092	What'll you have?
FO300011093	I'll have a drink.
FO300011094	Commin' up.
FO300011095	I'll have a drink.
FO300011096	We've got all kinds of chems.
FO300011097	What do you have for sale?
FO300011098	Need to do some killin' eh?
FO300011099	Can I see what kinds of guns you have for sale?
FO300011100	Here is our menu, sir.
FO300011101	I'm hungry.
FO300011102	Here is our menu, ma'am.
FO300011103	I'm hungry.
FO300011104	Let's get high.
FO300011105	I need some chems.
FO300011106	After what you did? Only because I have to.
FO300011107	What have you got to sell?
FO300011108	Anything for you! You sure fixed Bannon good.
FO300011109	What have you got to sell?
FO300011110	I've got a little bit of everything.
FO300011111	What have you got to sell?
FO300011112	Whatchya lookin' for?
FO300011113	I'm thinking of buying some ordinance.
FO300011114	Take a look at our menu.
FO300011115	What do you have to eat?
FO300011116	Please place your order.
FO300011117	What do you have to eat?
FO300011118	CG00DadSpeech
FO300011119	It's a girl? A girl! We've got a daughter, Catherine! A beautiful, healthy baby girl!
FO300011120	It's a boy? A boy! We've got a son, Catherine! A beautiful, healthy baby boy!
FO300011121	That's a good name. Don't you think? Fits you perfectly.
FO300011122	Looks like they've finished the gene projection. Let's see what you'll look like when you're all grown up.
FO300011123	You're going to look a lot like your dad.
FO300011124	See that, Catherine?
FO300011125	It's a big world out there, honey, full of all sorts of people. What about you? What kind of person are you going to be?
FO300011126	It's a big world out there, son, full of all sorts of people. What about you? What kind of person are you going to be?
FO300011127	Catherine? Catherine! She's in cardiac arrest! Start compressions! Get the baby out of here! Move. Move!
FO300011128	Really? You're not going to join me?
FO300011129	Really? You're not going to join me?
FO300011130	Okay, let's head for Rivet City.
FO300011131	That's my girl!
FO300011132	Let's hurry. Now that I know what we need, I want to get back to work as soon as possible.
FO300011133	That's my boy!
FO300011134	Let's hurry. Now that I know what we need, I want to get back to work as soon as possible.
FO300011135	Screw the Vault. I didn't need that place.
FO300011136	Is that so?
FO300011137	You're nineteen years old. Are you so sure you know what you want from life already?
FO300011138	I suppose it doesn't matter now. I suspect there's no going back for either of us. We'll just have to forge on ahead, won't we?
FO300011139	You left me there without saying goodbye. What was I supposed to do?
FO300011140	You were supposed to stay put. You could've had a good life in the Vault.
FO300011141	But I suppose it's too late to go back now, isn't it? The Overseer would likely have us shot on sight.
FO300011142	Well, then you'll just have to come with me to Rivet City. You've certainly proven yourself capable enough.
FO300011143	You need to go back to Rivet City?
FO300011144	The facility hasn't been used in years. There'll be enough work for a good number of people, and it will take us a while.
FO300011145	The sooner I get to Rivet City, the sooner Madison and I can get to work.
FO300011146	What about me? What am I supposed to do?
FO300011147	Yes, what about you? Why, in fact, are you outside the Vault at all? I don't even want to know HOW you got out.
FO300011148	As much as I appreciate your help, you were supposed to stay there, to make a life for yourself there, not out here!
FO300011149	Can we get out of here now?
FO300011150	Yes, yes! Absolutely! We need to get back to Rivet City. I've got to tell Madison that I have it.
FO300011151	After all these years, I finally have the key to making Project Purity a reality.
FO300011152	Did you get the information you needed?
FO300011153	I did indeed. Braun's work, the G.E.C.K., was designed to re-adapt environments for living after a nuclear war.
FO300011154	It's not entirely stable, but I'm sure that components of that technology are just what we need, what we've been missing all this time.
FO300011155	I need to return to Rivet City. Once Madison knows about the G.E.C.K., I can get her to see that it really will work.
FO300011156	What are YOU doing here? You could've been killed!
FO300011157	Well I didn't expect Dr. Braun to be alive and insane. I thought I'd just find notes, or holotapes.
FO300011158	I needed information about Braun, and his work on the G.E.C.K.
FO300011159	I came here to find you.
FO300011160	Well, I'm glad you did. This certainly wasn't how I expected things to turn out. I wasn't ready for Braun, or I might've fared better.
FO300011161	So you're going back to Rivet City right now?
FO300011162	Yes. With what I've learned, Madison is sure to see that we can finally succeed where we failed so many years ago.
FO300011163	I'd like you to come with me. I'd like you to be there when we finally open the floodgates.
FO300011164	You must understand. As much as I love you, this project has been my responsibility since long before you were even born.
FO300011165	If you'll let me, I'd like to show you what we've accomplished. I want you to be there when we change the world.
FO300011166	After so many years, I can finally see it through to the end. I can't stop now.
FO300011167	Don't you want to take a break, after what you've been through?
FO300011168	No, no. There will be time to rest when the work is complete. This is too important!
FO300011169	I need to get back to Rivet City right away. There's so much to be done.
FO300011170	No, no. There will be time to rest when the work is complete. This is too important!
FO300011171	I need to get back to Rivet City right away. There's so much work to be done.
FO300011172	What did you learn?
FO300011173	I was right about Braun. The technology he developed is unstable, even dangerous, but it can be adapted for Project Purity.
FO300011174	I need to return to Rivet City and talk with Madison. If we can find a G.E.C.K., we can make Project Purity work.
FO300011175	Good thing I showed up to save you.
FO300011176	It certainly is! It's nice to feel like I'm on two legs again.
FO300011177	And thanks to Doctor Braun, I know that Project Purity isn't lost after all.
FO300011178	What, you didn't like being a dog?
FO300011179	And now that I'm back, I can get back to work. I need to tell Madison what I've learned.
FO300011180	CG01Dad
FO300011181	Don't look straight into the light, honey. You'll hurt your eyes. It's just something you get used to down here.
FO300011182	Don't look straight into the light, pal. You'll hurt your eyes. It's just something you get used to down here.
FO300011183	Come on over here, sweetie. Come on! Walk to Daddy!
FO300011184	Come on over here, son. Come on! Walk to Daddy!
FO300011185	You can make it!
FO300011186	Just a little farther!
FO300011187	Over here!
FO300011188	Come to Daddy!
FO300011189	You can do it!
FO300011190	There you go! My goodness! Just a year old, and already walking like a pro.
FO300011191	Your mother would have been so proud.
FO300011192	Listen, kiddo, I know you don't like it when Daddy leaves you alone, but I need you to take care of yourself for a minute.
FO300011193	You just stay here while Daddy runs to his office. You'll be okay, pal. I'll be back in a bit.
FO300011194	You just stay here while Daddy runs to his office. You'll be okay, honey. I'll be back in a bit.
FO300011195	Ha ha ha! You're quite the little explorer, aren't you? Serves me right for trying to pen you in!
FO300011196	Come on over here. I want to show you something.
FO300011197	See that? It was your mother's favorite passage. It's from the Bible. Revelation 21:6.
FO300011198	"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely."
FO300011199	She always loved that.
FO300011200	Hahaha. Stupid robot.
FO300011201	No entry without tickets. Please present your tickets.
FO300011202	Let's rip off its arms.
FO300011203	Silly robot. Smash it!
FO300011204	DemoRobotTopicA
FO300011205	Threat level Omega. Lethal force authorized.
FO300011206	Metro security protocol in progress. Please stand clear of the offenders.
FO300011207	Stand clear, please.
FO300011208	Do not be alarmed. The metro will resume normal operation shortly.
FO300011209	Authorized ticketholders, please proceed to the main platform.
FO300011210	Nobody there. No bucketheads. Just old broken robot.
FO300011211	Bucketheads are finished! City is ours now!
FO300011212	I'm here to see Mister Burke.
FO300011213	Alright. Come on in. But I warn you. We're watching you.
FO300011214	MQ05DadLiStage10
FO300011215	Thank you, Madison. It's good to be working with you again.
FO300011216	Damn you, James. When this is all over, you owe me a drink. I'll get the team together.
FO300011217	And you know I wouldn't be here if I didn't think this would really work. It's time, Madison.
FO300011218	You know if it were anyone else asking me to do this, I'd have them run right out of Rivet City.
FO300011219	That's why we're going to head over there right now and get things up and running as best we can.
FO300011220	From the last reports, there's no power at the facility. Even if one of those computers had a database, we couldn't access it.
FO300011221	I know, I was thinking about that. The lab at the facility had some old pre-war computers that we scavenged. One of them might be useful.
FO300011222	It's as important to me as ever, Madison. I know it's important to you too. Let's finish this together.
FO300011223	You haven't lost any of your passion, have you James.
FO300011224	How could it not be worth improving the lives of everyone in the Wasteland? What could be a more worthy endeavor?
FO300011225	Madison, I'm telling you this is real. I talked to Braun himself. He confirmed it. Don't you see? This is what we've been waiting for!
FO300011226	And with good news. I was right about Braun and the G.E.C.K. If we can find one, we can adapt it to work with the purifiers.
FO300011227	James! You're back!
FO300011228	I told you it would work, Madison, and now I can prove it.
FO300011229	Hey, Jonas, get a picture of me with the big game hunter!
FO300011230	Over here, honey!
FO300011231	Over here, son!
FO300011232	Careful! It's a Radroach. Think you can take care of that with your BB gun? Just aim and shoot. You'll be fine.
FO300011233	Happy birthday, pal! I can't believe you're already 10. I'm so proud of you.
FO300011234	Happy birthday, honey! I can't believe you're already 10. I'm so proud of you.
FO300011235	Enjoy your party! You're only 10 once, so have fun!
FO300011236	MQ05DadBroadcast
FO300011237	Everyone, it seems we have some visitors. I don't know who they are or what they want.
FO300011238	I'd like to thank you all for returning to this project after so many years. I know some of you thought this day would never come.
FO300011239	Once the mainframe is online, we'll be able to access the database, and hopefully learn where we can find a G.E.C.K.
FO300011240	There's a lot of deterioration in the pipes, and some damage to the substructure, but it's nothing we can't fix.
FO300011241	We've restored power to the mainframe, which is coming online now.
FO300011242	All right everyone, you should be able to hear me now.
FO300011243	I guess. We don't get to talk much. I just wish Diego would notice that I'm not a child anymore.
FO300011244	Wouldn't you rather be with a real girl? Maybe you should try it before you decide.
FO300011245	But I did, Doctor Li. I put it right where you told me to.
FO300011246	Just some water.
FO300011247	Don't know where he is, and I'm not sure I care. I saw you talking to Bannon the other day. Did he mention me?
FO300011248	A little. Aren't you? We don't have a place to live, and your father is going to have to support us.
FO300011249	No, it's not true! Yes, she has been tempting me, trying to seduce me, but I've resisted.
FO300011250	That is a sin in the eyes of God, Mister Lopez. Surely he has a greater purpose for you. You should speak with Father Clifford.
FO300011251	Haven't seen you in church, Danvers. How about this week?
FO300011252	That is a sin in the eyes of God, Mister Lopez. Surely he has a greater purpose for you. Let us pray to Saint Monica.
FO300011253	You are a drunk and a harlot, Trinnie, but the Lord can still forgive you. Come to church on Sunday.
FO300011254	Your sins call me down here. Your souls need to be cleansed of the Devil's brew you serve.
FO300011255	The doctor is fine. If it weren't for her work, Rivet City would be no better than Megaton, Danvers.
FO300011256	I don't know, what do you want to do?
FO300011257	Do you have anything to calm my nerves? Paulie keeps trying to get me to try Psycho, but that stuff rots your brain.
FO300011258	I am doing the tasks I have been programmed for. Currently I am waiting for new orders.
FO300011259	I am not programmed for visual evaluation. However, Miss Vera tells me that the Iguana is only a day old.
FO300011260	Certainly, Mister Sister.
FO300011261	My family is dead and the world is a nuclear Wasteland. What exactly is it that I have to live for, Father Clifford?
FO300011262	Vera! Wonderful to see you. You look lovely today.
FO300011263	You know I'd do anything for you, Vera.
FO300011264	No. I don't want you hanging around that little bitch. She and her parents think they are so much better than me.
FO300011265	Don't be jealous of my wealth. Be jealous of my looks instead.
FO300011266	You should spend more time on the flight deck, Angela. You look so pale!
FO300011267	I don't need anyone to take care of me, Seagrave. But I do like being your friend. Just your friend.
FO300011268	RCGoodbye
FO300011269	Nothing, sir.
FO300011270	Oddly, sir? No, I haven't seen anyone else acting oddly.
FO300011271	So far everything's been quiet.
FO300011272	Sounds good. I'm beat.
FO300011273	No. I haven't seen anything.
FO300011274	Nothing I'd contact security for.
FO300011275	I think we're out of wine, but I'll check.
FO300011276	Really? That would be wonderful. I don't have enough caps right now, but I've been saving them up.
FO300011277	I'm just looking. I'm sure you don't have anything that would make me 18 any sooner.
FO300011278	You bastard! And to think I loved you! I hate you.
FO300011279	Thank you, Father. I'll ask him again, but he doesn't want to close the restaurant on Sunday mornings.
FO300011280	Okay. Don't forget to check the oven. Nobody will eat a burnt iguana.
FO300011281	No thanks, Paulie. Last time I tried that stuff Diego got so mad at me. I'll just get you some noodles.
FO300011282	We just got in a fresh batch. I'll go blow the dust off of one.
FO300011283	Sorry, Mr. Shrapnel. My dad asked me to see if you had anything new, and to check out what ammo you have.
FO300011284	Sorry, Mr. Shrapnel. I just came by to see if you had anything new, and to check out what ammo you have.
FO300011285	Diego takes me up there at night, but the sun isn't up then. Oh! I'm late Miss Vera. Goodbye!
FO300011286	Brock.
FO300011287	Harkness.
FO300011288	Yes, I am. Thank you.
FO300011289	Yes, sir. That may be the case.
FO300011290	There does seem to be some tension between the two decks. However, you're drunk. Just leave us alone.
FO300011291	No. Not today. Just bring me some Mole Rat, rare.
FO300011292	Of course. Just don't touch it. I don't want any grease stains from that kitchen on it.
FO300011293	Too bad for you, you mean. It's good business for me.
FO300011294	Shhh. I'm trying to listen.
FO300011295	I guess so. No law against it. Or at least none that I've signed.
FO300011296	We decided to build a railing on the flight deck, just as soon as we can get the scrap metal. Other than that, no.
FO300011297	Brahmin steak, with scotch.
FO300011298	Dresses don't grow on trees, Vera. I can only sell what the outlanders bring me.
FO300011299	You're always trying to pull that shit. You know I don't run tabs for nobody, Tammy.
FO300011300	That's a load of crap. Preach to them if you have to, but don't get in the way of their drinking.
FO300011301	Don't tell me how to run my business, Brock. These prices have worked for 30 years, and they be fine for 30 more.
FO300011302	This is the last one, Trinnie. You're too goddamn drunk.
FO300011303	You're full of crap, Father. If you keep bothering my customers, I'm going to throw you out. Again.
FO300011304	You're a Mirelurk humping, Wasteland reject, Armitage. You're getting a beer, and you're paying for it. And I expect a tip.
FO300011305	I don't serve that swill here. Beer, whiskey, even some wine, but no goddamn water.
FO300011306	Not much call for wine. Real men drink beer or whiskey.
FO300011307	Potent. It'll burn all the way down.
FO300011308	One glass of rotgut, coming up.
FO300011309	Armitage.
FO300011310	Your stuff is too expensive. I'm saving up for something special though.
FO300011311	Nope. Leastwise none that you need to worry about.
FO300011312	Not today. I've got enough for a while.
FO300011313	I'm hoping to have the caps for a new one next month.
FO300011314	Tammy, you're always drunk in the Rudder. Now go bother someone else.
FO300011315	Yeah, my life is real glamorous. You just keep believing that, kid.
FO300011316	He won't know what hit him.
FO300011317	You're too young. And right now, you're too drunk. Sober up and we'll see if you still want to have this conversation.
FO300011318	Actually, Father, I'm a real asshole. Now get out of my face before I toss you in with the Mirelurks.
FO300011319	Careful, Sister. Bigger isn't always badder.
FO300011320	Mirelurk Cakes with a beer.
FO300011321	Better than last time. I hate the taste of Mirelurk.
FO300011322	Not now, dear. You'll spoil your meal.
FO300011323	Shhh! It's not polite to ask that here. Now eat your food. Daddy paid good money for it.
FO300011324	Shhh! It's not polite to ask that here. Now eat your food. I paid good money for it.
FO300011325	Shhh! Don't say things like that in church. Now be quiet and listen to Father Clifford.
FO300011326	They are well, Father. C.J. is growing up so fast. I am so proud of her.
FO300011327	As well as can be expected, Father. I'm still recovering from CJ's death.
FO300011328	Father Clifford looks pleased.
FO300011329	You go if you want. There's too many of the wrong sort up there at this time of night.
FO300011330	If you people would take better care of your own spaces, it wouldn't be a problem.
FO300011331	I'll have a Mirelurk cake and some water.
FO300011332	I've got nothing like that here. Why don't you go have a drink in the Muddy Rudder? That should do it.
FO300011333	Paulie stole the key. I'll need you to stop by and change the lock for me.
FO300011334	Water and a Mirelurk cake, please.
FO300011335	I don't think you need a love potion, dear. Besides, none of these will do that.
FO300011336	Yeah, right. As soon as I'm gone, you'll use all the inventory, Paulie. How about I just close up tonight.
FO300011337	Anything I might give you would come with a side effect. Why don't you go to Doctor Preston?
FO300011338	Anything I might give you would come with a side effect. It's too bad Doctor Preston isn't with us anymore.
FO300011339	I really miss him. I didn't think it would hurt this much.
FO300011340	James isn't so bad, Chief. He's my friend. I'll make sure he's good.
FO300011341	Thank you, Father. I tried, but his mother said no. Sorry.
FO300011342	That doesn't sound like any fun. Let's just play hide and seek.
FO300011343	Not yet, Dad. In a minute.
FO300011344	Okay, Mom.
FO300011345	Sorry, Mom.
FO300011346	Aw, Mom, do I have to?
FO300011347	Hello, Mrs. Cantelli.
FO300011348	Sorry. I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
FO300011349	Just some mutfruit and a Nuka-Cola please.
FO300011350	Just keeping the deck safe for all you Upper Deck types.
FO300011351	Paulie, you're wasted. Just do me a favor and don't fall off the deck.
FO300011352	I suppose that's true. Doesn't mean I have to like it though.
FO300011353	I'll send someone down to change the locks.
FO300011354	Bitch.
FO300011355	Everything is quiet, sir.
FO300011356	All quiet, Commander.
FO300011357	Dude, that would be such a drag. Last resort, man. Last resort.
FO300011358	Sure thing, Mei. I'll clean it up later. Right now I've got this song stuck in my head.
FO300011359	Me? Read? That would be awesome. I've heard there's a lot of cool stuff in books.
FO300011360	Dude, I will definitely not let that happen. I'll get right on that life thing though. Maybe after my nap.
FO300011361	No offense Father, but Saint Monica has never done anything for me. I've always had to take care of myself.
FO300011362	I'm like, kinda short on caps. I'll just have a carrot, an apple, and some water.
FO300011363	My relationship with Angela is strictly platonic, Commander. Saint Monica's blessing to you.
FO300011364	God Bless you, Vera. You are too kind to us.
FO300011365	We're not alone, so it'll have to wait. Maybe later today.
FO300011366	That's not very polite, Angela, but thank you anyway.
FO300011367	Lord give me strength.
FO300011368	No, not yet. I'm still studying the life of Saint Monica. Hopefully someday soon.
FO300011369	Yes, Father Clifford. I've already cleaned the sanctuary. I'll put out fresh candles too.
FO300011370	Yes, Father Clifford.
FO300011371	Yes, Doctor Preston. Father Clifford and I will minister to the needs of their souls. We let you minister to the needs of their bodies.
FO300011372	Yes, Doctor Preston. I will minister to the needs of their souls. You can minister to the needs of their bodies.
FO300011373	I hope I will live up to his example. See you next week Mrs. Young.
FO300011374	Yes, it was. <yawn> Excuse me. See you next week Vera.
FO300011375	He was? I mean, I know. He tries very hard Mister Young. See you next week.
FO300011376	Then I'll try the iguana.
FO300011377	I'll try, but he's pretty set in his ways. See you next week, Mei.
FO300011378	No. Ask Mister Buckingham.
FO300011379	Not yet. Give me a few minutes, Mister Buckingham.
FO300011380	It's about time. Sorry, Henry. I know you're doing the best you can, but these delays are frustrating.
FO300011381	Perfect. I'll be ready for them.
FO300011382	So you say. All I see is wasted time away from my work. That's what Rivet City really needs from me.
FO300011383	Make sure it's locked this time. We don't want them stolen again.
FO300011384	Oh. So you did.
FO300011385	And it's my job to make sure you stay that way, so just let me do my job.
FO300011386	That's wonderful. I've read about broccoli in the old books, but I've never seen any.
FO300011387	I suppose it can't hurt. Just try not to disturb anyone that's sleeping.
FO300011388	I suppose. Don't go filling their heads with any of that faith healing crap though.
FO300011389	Am I that predictable? I guess so. Yes, the usual.
FO300011390	I am a man of peace, Brock. I am only here to preach the word of the Lord.
FO300011391	There is always the opportunity to help others. God still has a purpose for you in this life.
FO300011392	They need their eternal souls saved too, Doctor Preston. Have no fear, I won't occupy them for long.
FO300011393	Just leave. I cannot bear to look at you. You are hereby excommunicated from the church. May your soul wither in purgatory.
FO300011394	I'm thinking of preaching about one of the seven deadly sins. I haven't decided which one though.
FO300011395	I'm glad you thought so, Vera. Bless you.
FO300011396	Thank you, Henry. And God bless you.
FO300011397	Thank you, Angela.
FO300011398	I pray that the whole congregation feels the same way, Christie.
FO300011399	Nice of you to say so, Mei.
FO300011400	I can see that liquor has affected your temper. Good day, sir.
FO300011401	No, no. Just call me Father, not Mister. Sometimes I think Vera programmed you that way just to annoy me. I'll just have water.
FO300011402	Can't complain. I've got some new stuff in. You should come by and take a look.
FO300011403	Bring them by anytime.
FO300011404	Nah. Just break it down for parts.
FO300011405	Ammo's moving, but not the guns. They just don't break down like they used to.
FO300011406	Really? I heard it was tough and too salty. I think I'll have Mirelurk Cakes instead.
FO300011407	I'm thinking about firing off a couple.
FO300011408	Get me a beer.
FO300011409	I got a little of everything. Go ahead and pick out what you want.
FO300011410	Don't worry. I'll keep it under control tonight.
FO300011411	Okay, just this once. Belle, another beer for Trinnie.
FO300011412	It's a mighty sweet temptation, Father. Now leave me the fuck alone.
FO300011413	Mirelurk Cakes, and a beer.
FO300011414	Thanks for the advice.
FO300011415	I don't see her much these days. I'd much rather she spend her time with Diego than with someone like that Ted Strayer.
FO300011416	No tabs. Nobody gets a tab. I'll get you your usual, and you'll pay me, as usual.
FO300011417	My pleasure, Tammy. I think I have some Iguana Bits for James.
FO300011418	Right away, Tammy.
FO300011419	Coming up, Flak.
FO300011420	An excellent choice, Seagrave.
FO300011421	That wasn't burnt, Shrapnel. It was blackened. It's a gourmet method I read about. I'll make it tartar this time.
FO300011422	I made them just yesterday.
FO300011423	With pleasure Mrs. Cantelli.
FO300011424	Sure. Since your parents aren't around to tell you no, you get to make your own choices.
FO300011425	So long as it's okay with your parents, C.J.
FO300011426	Okay. I'll go lower the bucket.
FO300011427	No. It's the same as yesterday. And last week. And the week before. Let me know if you want to order.
FO300011428	Yes, Doctor Li.
FO300011429	Certainly, Janice.
FO300011430	I'm not a very religious man, Diego. Sorry.
FO300011431	Sorry Henry. I'll remove them before the end of the day.
FO300011432	No. I don't do chems. I'm this way from hard work and sweat, two things I'm sure you don't know. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to eat. Alone.
FO300011433	Just fine. Lots of people are asking me about it.
FO300011434	Not yet.
FO300011435	Good thing too. I don't feel like busting heads tonight.
FO300011436	First thing tomorrow, Commander Danvers.
FO300011437	Ted, you're wasting your life. You need to find a purpose, or at least find a job. By the way, Christie Young could use some help.
FO300011438	Ted, you're wasting your life. You need to find a purpose, or at least find a job.
FO300011439	Thank you, Diego. Speaking of rounds, I need to get back to them.
FO300011440	You're wasted, Paulie. If you're going to stay on the flight deck, try to stay away from the railing.
FO300011441	I'm sure the boys will use them for target practice. You might want to stay below deck.
FO300011442	Yes, Doctor Li. I've recalibrated with them.
FO300011443	I'll make that your bedtime story. Now run along, sweetie.
FO300011444	Not yet, sweetheart. Finish you meal first.
FO300011445	Church will be over soon. Just try and sit still.
FO300011446	Don't make a fuss over it. Their just kids. Besides, maybe C.J. will rub off on James and not the other way around.
FO300011447	Amen. We have each other, and we have C.J.
FO300011448	The transformer is still touch and go. Doctor Li hopes her most recent tests will  be good.
FO300011449	Thank you, Father. I pray every night for her success.
FO300011450	I'll check it out before the end of the day.
FO300011451	Not right now. Check back with me later.
FO300011452	Take your sarcasm somewhere else, Cindy. It's not my fault you married an addict and I have a family.
FO300011453	Have you no sense of decency? I just want something to dull the memory. I can't believe she's dead.
FO300011454	I'll have Iguana on a Stick. C.J. will have some Mutfruit and a Nuka-Cola.
FO300011455	I'll have Iguana on a Stick.
FO300011456	Yes, mom.
FO300011457	I wasn't doing anything! And C.J. is my friend. I hate you! I hope you die!
FO300011458	I'm not a squirt! My name is James, and you're an asshole. My mom said you're good for nothing, and she oughta know.
FO300011459	I want an Iguana on a Stick, but my mom won't let me have one.
FO300011460	Just give me some Iguana Bits.
FO300011461	They should be just fine. Try it again.
FO300011462	I've got a new strain of lima bean I'm developing. I'll bring a sample sometime.
FO300011463	That sounds like a good idea. I'll ask Doctor Li which papers I can let you have. I'll get back to you later.
FO300011464	They're fine. However, I have two others that are making odd noises. Please check them out soon.
FO300011465	Thank you, Garza.
FO300011466	No, I'm fine Mister Buckingham.
FO300011467	Thank you, Chief. I'm terrified that he will recognize me. I hope he leaves soon.
FO300011468	Yes, I am Chief. Now I can sleep at night without wondering if he'll take me while I'm sleeping.
FO300011469	Look, I keep telling you. I'm not into that. Psycho rots your brain. Just leave me alone.
FO300011470	Yes. Every night on the flight deck. Paulie, those chems are trashing your memory. Now let me eat in peace.
FO300011471	My story is my business. I just want to be left alone.
FO300011472	Yeah, yeah. You've been telling me this for months. Besides, once you're gone, you won't be around to miss anything.
FO300011473	Could I have some Iguana Bits and a Nuka-Cola, please?
FO300011474	Thank you, Father. Attending church always makes me feel stronger.
FO300011475	I am trying Father. I just don't see how Saint Monica can stop a bullet or break a set of manacles. But, I will try.
FO300011476	That would be nice, Mister Buckingham.
FO300011477	Yes, Mister Washington.
FO300011478	Yes, sir.
FO300011479	Your food will be ready shortly, Mister Zimmer.
FO300011480	Certainly, Sir.
FO300011481	Very good, sir.
FO300011482	Yes, ma'am.
FO300011483	I'd like two carrots and some water.
FO300011484	Life is hell. My life is hell. I just wish I had the courage to do something about it. Why don't you just leave me alone.
FO300011485	Thank you, but no. I talk to Father Clifford, but it doesn't seem to help me.
FO300011486	I'm not sure it will help, but I will pray with you, Father.
FO300011487	That might be best. Would you please ask Father Clifford if I might have a few moments of his time?
FO300011488	I know, I know. Tonight's my last night. Honest.
FO300011489	Whoa. No such thing as too much. In fact, I'm going to do some more.
FO300011490	Water and Iguana Bits.
FO300011491	Don't worry about me. Uh, huh. I can take care of myself.
FO300011492	Sir! Yes, Sir!
FO300011493	Ha, ha! Nothing you'd be interested in. Only good stuff.
FO300011494	If you ever change your mind, Vera. I'll be here, waiting.
FO300011495	A man can hope, Danvers. Besides, I don't have a problem with the Upper Deck like you do.
FO300011496	Noodles and beer. A match made in heaven, eh?
FO300011497	Not today, Angela. Maybe next week.
FO300011498	I learned my lesson, Danvers. Just keep those damn Raiders away from me.
FO300011499	Sure thing. I'll bring them by later for you.
FO300011500	It's fine. You worry too much.
FO300011501	You need a new joke, Cindy. I've only heard that one about a million times.
FO300011502	Whiskey, straight.
FO300011503	It's doing well enough for me to come down here and buy drinks.
FO300011504	Nah. You gotta buy at least one box.
FO300011505	We only had one night together, Trinnie. Go get your own drinks.
FO300011506	Give me a Brahmin steak, potato, and a beer.
FO300011507	Hells bells, girl. I ain't no mister. Just call me Shrapnel. Yeah, I got some 10mm rounds. I'll bring them over to him later.
FO300011508	Sure, I'll take a drink. Flak and I don't talk about our past. Everyone knows we weren't born on Rivet City though.
FO300011509	Armitage.
FO300011510	Beer. And don't let it get empty.
FO300011511	I'm here to drink, not to fight.
FO300011512	Not happening, Trinnie. I already paid that debt. Go find someone else to hit up.
FO300011513	Hey, I've got my own problems. I don't have time to be on the lookout for yours.
FO300011514	Yeah, it's just fine. Unless of course you want to warm my bed for me? Nah? Then stop botherin' me.
FO300011515	Step away from my beer, Father, or I'll be raising my fist.
FO300011516	Don't call me Mister, you goddamn bucket of bolts! Just bring me an iguana on stick.
FO300011517	Fucking junk heap. I should start eating at Gary's.
FO300011518	To hell with that brat. And to hell with you, Harkness. I'll drink as much as I want.
FO300011519	Shut your trap. You'll eat what I give you and be grateful for it, or I'll give you something to be really sorry for.
FO300011520	Do I look like I give a crap? Now get away from me. I don't want you filling James' head with your dopehead ideas.
FO300011521	Do I look like I give a crap? Now get away from me.
FO300011522	Other than you? No.
FO300011523	Whiskey and water. Go light on the water.
FO300011524	James? Who knows where that little shit has run off to. Mind your own business, Brock. I'm going to get a drink.
FO300011525	Mole rat, well done, with wine. Leave the bottle. James has been bad. He gets a carrot and some water.
FO300011526	Mole rat, well done, with wine. Leave the bottle.
FO300011527	Sure thing, Chief. Next time I'll take him into the back to fuck him instead. Sheesh!
FO300011528	Fuck you, bitch. Oh, wait. Nobody wants to because you're too fugly!
FO300011529	I'll say when I've had enough. You aren't my mother, Belle, so fuck off.
FO300011530	Not yet. I'm still able to remember. Leave me alone, Brock. You aren't my father. Thank God, too.
FO300011531	I'm not that desperate.
FO300011532	You're wrong. I haven't had enough to drink. In fact, I think I'll order another one right now.
FO300011533	Huh? I don't get it. Nevermind. Just buy me another drink.
FO300011534	I prefer beer to whiskey, Father. And unless you want to buy me the next round, get lost.
FO300011535	Thank you, Chief Harkness.
FO300011536	Mister Buckingham can handle the Weatherly for a couple of hours.
FO300011537	A girl has to be able to protect herself, even if that means buying a gun.
FO300011538	I guess I'll just be window shopping then.
FO300011539	I know, I know. He's nice enough, but just not my type. Take care, and don't spread too much gossip.
FO300011540	I just stopped by to say hello. And to see if you have anything new for sale.
FO300011541	You go do what you have to. I don't want to watch that.
FO300011542	You need to stop giving me special discounts, Seagrave. A new toaster oven would sure be handy though. I'll pick it up later.
FO300011543	Thank you, Father. I've been trying to get Seagrave to come to church too, but he's stubborn.
FO300011544	Thank you, Father. I always feel the presence of the Lord when I pray here.
FO300011545	No. He's never going to notice you, Cindy. Especially if you're still with Paulie. Just forget about Bannon.
FO300011546	Stop! You're embarrassing me, but thank you. I should go. I want to see Cindy and Angela too.
FO300011547	Stop! You're embarrassing me, but thank you. I should go.
FO300011548	I've told you before. I don't feel that way about you. I'm sorry.
FO300011549	I'll see what I can find, Mister Armitage.
FO300011550	Certainly, Mister Zimmer.
FO300011551	Oh, he notices all right. You should forget about him. Priests are married to God and take vows of celibacy.
FO300011552	No, not right now. Carry on Mister Buckingham.
FO300011553	<sigh> Sometimes I hate working with robots.
FO300011554	Yes, of course. I'll watch my alcohol intake.
FO300011555	Good. Stay alert. He could be anywhere.
FO300011556	Relax. I'm sure there is no danger here.
FO300011557	Not yet, Chief Harkness.
FO300011558	I could really care less about you and your brat, Madam.
FO300011559	Your food is very nourshing, Vera.
FO300011560	A glass of wine, if you please.
FO300011561	Yes. Iguana Bits, water, and a piece of fruit. Anything will do.
FO300011562	I'm on patrol, punk. Try and stay out of my way.
FO300011563	MQ05TalkResponse01
FO300011564	I suppose you're right. Being back here after all this time, I can't help but be a little concerned.
FO300011565	I'm already taking care of that. I'll let you know if there are any abnormal results.
FO300011566	Doctor Li asked me to keep an eye on the power relays in level 3, but I'll take care of that for you.
FO300011567	Yes sir. I'll attend to that in just a moment.
FO300011568	MQ05Talk02
FO300011569	It's fine, Madison. Everything is taken care of. There's no reason to be nervous.
FO300011570	We haven't forgotten anything. We're on top of the situation. Come on, we're professionals!
FO300011571	Make sure to stay in contact with Daniel and Alex. I'm waiting for a report from them.
FO300011572	When you have a moment, can you check the pressure on tanks 3 and 4? I'm concerned there may be a leak.
FO300011573	MQ05InfoGeneral
FO300011574	Did we forget to compensate for the power fluctuations in our last calculation? I'd hate to see us short something out now.
FO300011575	I'm concerned that we're overlooking something, James. I don't want us to be too hasty.
FO300011576	Yes, Doctor?
FO300011577	Nothing's wrong, Dad.
FO300011578	Okay, then. You're doing fine. Just aim and shoot. I think you'll be a natural.
FO300011579	I'm out of BBs.
FO300011580	Out already? Something wrong with the sights on that thing? Here you go, honey.
FO300011581	Out already? Something wrong with the sights on that thing? Here you go, son.
FO300011582	I can't do it!
FO300011583	Of course you can. I'm not always going to be here to take care of you. You're going to have to learn to fend for yourself.
FO300011584	Now, take your time, breathe slowly, sight down the barrel, and squeeze the trigger.
FO300011585	I can do it!
FO300011586	I know you can, and that's good. I'm not always going to be here to take care of you. You've got to learn to fend for yourself.
FO300011587	Now, take your time, breathe slowly, sight down the barrel, and squeeze the trigger.
FO300011588	How do I kill it?
FO300011589	I'd try using that new gun of yours!
FO300011590	They're pretty easy to kill. More a nuisance than anything else.
FO300011591	Of course, you could just aim for the head. A good headshot will do a lot of damage to most anything.
FO300011592	What's a Radroach?
FO300011593	Nasty little things. They pretty much keep to dark places, though. That's why there are always lights on in the Vault.
FO300011594	Thanks, Dad.
FO300011595	You're welcome, pal. Happy birthday.
FO300011596	You're welcome, sweetie. Happy birthday.
FO300011597	This is so great! Thanks!
FO300011598	Couldn't have done it without Jonas' help. You make sure to thank him.
FO300011599	What do I get to kill?
FO300011600	Easy now. It's only a BB gun, but it's not a toy. Let's go try it out. Jonas and I have found a nice spot for you. Follow me.
FO300011601	Here? We can't shoot a gun here.
FO300011602	We sure can't, unless we want the Overseer beating down our door. Jonas and I have found a place, though. C'mon!
FO300011603	I don't like surprises.
FO300011604	Since when? Regardless, I think you'll like this one. You're getting older, and you've got your Pip-Boy. I figure you're old enough for this, too.
FO300011605	Your own BB gun! It's a little old, but it should work perfectly.
FO300011606	You know how tough it is to find a spring that small? Good thing Butch "misplaced" that switchblade of his. Ha ha ha!
FO300011607	So, what do you think? Want to give it a try?
FO300011608	What kind of surprise?
FO300011609	The Overseer gave you your Pip-Boy, and you're old enough to do some work. So I figure you’re old enough for this.
FO300011610	Your own BB gun! It's a little old, but it should work perfectly.
FO300011611	You know how tough it is to find a spring that small? Good thing Butch "misplaced" that switchblade of his. Ha ha ha!
FO300011612	So, what do you think? Want to give it a try?
FO300011613	Stop that! You're so stupid. My Mom says you're ugly and a bitch too.
FO300011614	I don't know, what do you want to do?
FO300011615	RCGoodbye02
FO300011616	Don't worry, Diego. I'll take care of you. I even found a room below decks for us. Our love will sustain us.
FO300011617	Of course I'm excited. Diego is a wreck though. My dad might have to help him up the aisle instead of me.
FO300011618	Diego insisted. He may not be a priest any more, but he still has his faith.
FO300011619	Oh, Dad! Stop that or you'll have me crying. You can visit Diego and me any time. And I'll still be working with you.
FO300011620	Thank you Mister Holmes. We'll need lots of things for our new home, so I'm sure we'll be shopping here.
FO300011621	It took him long enough to get the hint. I had to practically write it out for him. Men!
FO300011622	Yes, I got the invitation. I wouldn't miss you and Diego's wedding for anything.
FO300011623	Why are you so mean sometimes? I'm always nice to you.
FO300011624	This week doesn't look good either, Father.
FO300011625	God and Saint Monica hear my sermons. That's good enough for me.
FO300011626	Sorry. I just don't have enough money, Angela. I really wish I could.
FO300011627	Thank you. No, they don't have a date for the wedding yet, but it will be soon.
FO300011628	I am. Diego is a good boy. They will make a happy couple.
FO300011629	My little girl is all grown up. I hope I don't cry at the wedding.
FO300011630	Thank you, Diego. You'll make a fine priest some day.
FO300011631	She's not a bitch, you are! I hate you! You're ruining my life.
FO300011632	<Disable Cerberus' combat inhibitor.>
FO300011633	Whoa Nelly! Sensing combat inhibitor removal! Guns are hot! Firing for effect! Welcome to Hell, you zombie freaks!
FO300011634	You ever get outside, Cerberus? Into the Wasteland?
FO300011635	Negatory! I have been programmed to remain on premises at all times! In the event of hostilities, I will respond with deadly force!
FO300011636	Go Underworld! Go Ghouls! Yay!
FO300011637	What can you tell me about Underworld?
FO300011638	They deserve the same love and respect as any human, and don't you forget it!
FO300011639	At least, that's what they programmed me to say.
FO300011640	Personally, I think they're a bunch of rotting zombie maggot farms, and I'd send them all back to hell if I could. Damn, this combat inhibitor!
FO300011641	So what are you, the guard dog?
FO300011642	I am Cerberus! It is my solemn duty to guard the citizens of Underworld against any and all threats, both foreign and domestic!

FO300011645	Ya’ll be careful with that thar weapon, ya hear?

FO300011647	Welcome to Megaton. The bomb is perfectly safe. We promise.
FO300011648	Welcome to Megaton. Please stand clear of the gate.
FO300011649	Welcome to Megaton. Friendliest town around.

FO300011654	That zombie's a real corpse now!
FO300011655	One less of those things to deal with.
FO300011656	Damn it. I kill one and three more show up!
FO300011657	How many of these things do we have to kill?
FO300011658	He's down!
FO300011659	A Brother has fallen!
FO300011660	You dare take the life of a Brother of Steel!
FO300011661	His was a good death.
FO300011662	Focus, Brothers. Focus on the enemy!
FO300011663	Let his death not be in vain!
FO300011664	Hell yeah! How do you like me now!
FO300011665	Thought you could take me, did you?
FO300011666	Dead!
FO300011667	Damnit. I'm just trying to keep the peace.
FO300011668	Goddamnit. Everyone stand the hell down! Let's solve this peacefully.
FO300011669	Dead. Great.
FO300011670	Now I'm pissed.
FO300011671	Argh!
FO300011672	There. You see? Natural selection at it's finest.
FO300011673	Death can be so messy, can't it.
FO300011674	I hope someone deals with that body soon. I detest the smell of rotting flesh.
FO300011675	Death is such nasty business.
FO300011676	Oh my God!
FO300011677	You can't kill us all!
FO300011678	Nooooo!
FO300011679	He is fallen!
FO300011680	Dead! No!!
FO300011681	He'll be remembered.
FO300011682	I will avenge you.
FO300011683	There's no place for disgrace.
FO300011684	Man down! Man down!
FO300011685	Unit down!
FO300011686	Rest easy, soldier!
FO300011687	We have a casualty!
FO300011688	You've done your deed for God and country.
FO300011689	I can't look!
FO300011690	No!
FO300011691	Oh no!
FO300011692	This can't be happening!
FO300011693	Please no!
FO300011694	Somebody help!
FO300011695	Bastard! You'll pay for that!
FO300011696	Now I'm REALLY mad!
FO300011697	Son of a bitch!
FO300011698	You'll pay for that!
FO300011699	This ain't over yet!
FO300011700	Dammit! That was our fourth for poker!
FO300011701	Man down! Man down!
FO300011702	Man down!
FO300011703	We've lost one.
FO300011704	I'll make them pay for that.
FO300011705	Go in peace, Brother.
FO300011706	No!
FO300011707	Oh no!
FO300011708	Somebody help!
FO300011709	They killed him!
FO300011710	They killed her!
FO300011711	Dumbass.
FO300011712	More loot for me!
FO300011713	Dammit! They owed me 50 caps!
FO300011714	Goddamn, I'm glad that wasn't me!

FO300011722	Duck!
FO300011723	Protect yourself!
FO300011724	It's live!
FO300011725	Go, go, go!
FO300011726	Get away from it!
FO300011727	Heads down!
FO300011728	Watch out!
FO300011729	Nooooo!
FO300011730	Why is this so important?
FO300011731	You remember the Bible passage, about the waters of life? It's more than just a poster on a wall.
FO300011732	Your mother and I, we lived by that ideal. Water, clean and free, for everyone in the Wasteland!
FO300011733	Isn't it worth taking a risk to give that hope to people?
FO300011734	"Your responsibility"? What does that mean?
FO300011735	Project Purity was underway long before you were born. There were many of us, including your mother, who devoted our lives to it.
FO300011736	The idea of free, clean water for everyone drove us to succeed. So many sacrifices were made for that idea.
FO300011737	My responsibility is to see it through to the end, to make sure those sacrifices mean something.
FO300011738	What are you doing here?
FO300011739	I needed information about Doctor Braun's research and development of the G.E.C.K. It's vital to getting Project Purity running.
FO300011740	I was expecting to find notes, or holotapes. I didn't plan on being caught up in Braun's twisted fantasy world.
FO300011741	So you've been lying to me all this time?
FO300011742	Yes, I lied about where you were born. About where I was born. I admit that.
FO300011743	At the time, I felt the truth would only encourage you to try and leave the Vault, to go looking for your past.
FO300011744	Perhaps I should've handled things differently. I'm sorry.
FO300011745	What the hell is wrong with you? Why did you just leave me like that?
FO300011746	That's where you belonged. You were an adult, capable of fending for yourself, and you had a good life ahead of you.
FO300011747	What's out here is my task, my responsibility. I never wanted you to have any part of this insanity.
FO300011748	I want answers from you.
FO300011749	You came all this way, and risked your life for answers? They must be important to you.
FO300011750	I'll get that door open, and then you can let your hordes in.
FO300011751	Well get going, then! Open the door! What's taking you so damn long? Hurry up!
FO300011752	I can get them to let you move in / You can now move in.
FO300011753	You think so, do you? Give it a shot kid, but you're dreaming. I'll wait to give you a shot, but then we're doing it my way.
FO300011754	I think I can convince them to let you live there.
FO300011755	I'll be damned. Really? Good job kid! I was willing to unleash the Ferals and kill all those bigots. Guess I don't have to now.
FO300011756	Here's a little something for your troubles, it'll help you deal with our Feral brethren if you meet any.
FO300011757	I've taken care of things. You can move in now!
FO300011758	Whatever. I'm leaving.
FO300011759	That's the smartest thing you've said since you met me.
FO300011760	Good luck with that. I'll have none of it.
FO300011761	You got a lot to learn, kid. A lot. Like for instance how not to piss off an angry Ghoul. You best get out of here, before I get real ugly.
FO300011762	Whatever. You're no better than Tenpenny.
FO300011763	If I'm no better than Tenpenny, then he should let me into that tower. But he won't. So, I'm busting in.
FO300011764	You're a zombie! People should shoot you!
FO300011765	Oh yeah? Fine. It's on!
FO300011766	Well, maybe I should talk to Tenpenny. There may be a peaceful solution.
FO300011767	Try it if you like. Go talk to Tenpenny. Ask him he wants us living there.  It won't work. So when you fail, we can do it my way.
FO300011768	This is going to be fun!
FO300011769	Indeed. Remember. I'll be waiting for you to get that door open. Don't keep me waiting long, kid.
FO300011770	Right on. Kill those elitists. I think I can help you with that escape door.
FO300011771	Now you're talking my language. Alright, here's the plan.
FO300011772	I'll gather up a horde of ferals and wait for you by that escape door. You find a way to get it open and then we'll sit back and enjoy the show!
FO300011773	Let me try talking to Tenpenny. Maybe he wouldn't mind you living there.
FO300011774	Ha! Those snooty bitches probably can't stand living with each other, let alone with us.
FO300011775	But by all means, try talking to Tenpenny if you like. But it won't work. Then we'll do it my way.
FO300011776	You get that escape door in the Tenpenny basement open, and I'll unleash those ferals on 'em!
FO300011777	It's not really any of my business. Sorry I asked.
FO300011778	You're right. It's none of your business. You best get out of here, kid. Before something ugly happens.
FO300011779	It's Tenpenny's tower. He can do whatever he wants.
FO300011780	Not sure where you come from kid, but out here in the Wasteland, everything's up for grabs. And you only get to keep what you can hold onto.
FO300011781	Tenpenny didn't build that tower. He found it. And took it from whoever used to own it. Now we're gonna take it from him.
FO300011782	We tried playing nice, but they shot at us. Fuck 'em. It's time for them and their bigot ways to die.
FO300011783	I might be able to get you in there.
FO300011784	I already got a plan. They think I’m a monster. I’ll show them the real monsters!
FO300011785	We'll unleash our feral brethren on them; all those bigoted sons-of-bitches will get torn apart. Trouble is getting past the damn subway access door!
FO300011786	You see, there's some kind of escape door that leads from the Tenpenny basement to the subway tunnels. There must be some way to get that open.
FO300011787	I'm going in.
FO300011788	Now I won't be able to contact you once you're in there. You'll exit near the cisterns, and then you can get in touch with me again.
FO300011789	Is this dangerous?
FO300011790	No, not at all. You'll just need to turn a valve. It'll only take a moment.
FO300011791	MQ05IntercomTalk1
FO300011792	Honey? Over here; the intercom.
FO300011793	Son? Over here; the intercom.
FO300011794	<Say nothing.>
FO300011795	You're a poet, right? Do you have a name?
FO300011796	I'm getting impatient.
FO300011797	Let's talk about something else.
FO300011798	You've become a bit of a bore, haven't you? Go away!
FO300011799	Let's talk about something else.
FO300011800	I guess it just runs in the family.
FO300011801	I suppose it does.
FO300011802	Look, I am sorry that I left you. I did what I thought was best for you. I don't know how else to say it.
FO300011803	RCGoodbye03
FO300011804	I'm on my break, so I'm just looking around. I guess you don't have anything new today.
FO300011805	Your mom was no Saint Monica. I wouldn't want someone like her. Besides, I like cooking.
FO300011806	It's ready for you, Father.
FO300011807	TenpennyGREETINGChoice3
FO300011808	Rubbish! You must be daft. Look around! Where else in the Wasteland have you seen such magnificence, I ask you?
FO300011809	I had the great fortune to run into Mr. Burke, an absolute gem of a man. He certainly has a way of getting done what needs to get done, doesn't he?
FO300011810	Then it was a matter of getting the right type of tenants with the right type of assets, and the rest is, as they say, history.
FO300011811	Eh. It's okay here.
FO300011812	Look, if you don't care about yourself, then no one else will. And nothing says "I love me" better than a fabulous new look. Am I right? I'm right.
FO300011813	Whatever.
FO300011814	You should take more interest in your well-being. Carelessness leads to the spread of disease. Is there something you need?
FO300011815	Blah blah blah.
FO300011816	Just try not to break anything, okay?
FO300011817	Whatever.
FO300011818	I see, sir. Very well. May I pour you a drink?
FO300011819	<Say nothing.>
FO300011820	Well. Like I said. Take a seat anywhere, except at Mister Tenpenny's table.
FO300011821	Whatever you say.
FO300011822	TenpennyGREETINGChoice2
FO300011823	I say! Must you be so caustic? Come now, a lot of work went into turning this husk of a tower into a place people can call home.
FO300011824	I've had help, of course. Especially in Mr. Burke, an absolute gem of a man. He certainly has a way of getting done what needs to get done.
FO300011825	Then it was a matter of getting the right type of tenants with the right type of assets, and the rest is, as they say, history.
FO300011826	You didn't build this tower, you just found it and moved in. Big fucking deal.
FO300011827	Fine. Keep wearing that trashy outfit. I don't care. You probably couldn't afford to upgrade your look anyway. Ah, I could have made you fabulous.
FO300011828	You got a problem with the way I dress?
FO300011829	It isn't cheap to live here. Is there something you want?
FO300011830	I hear doctors make a ton of caps.
FO300011831	You wouldn't know true value if it slapped you in the face!
FO300011832	This is a store?
FO300011833	I see, sir. Very well. May I pour you a drink?
FO300011834	I hate robots.
FO300011835	Most people consider mistreating food service providers as an invitation to get a little something unexpected in their meal.
FO300011836	Of course, I will do nothing of the sort.
FO300011837	I don't need a smile. What I need is some food.
FO300011838	TenpennyGREETINGChoice1
FO300011839	Righto! When I saw this place jutting up out of the horizon, I knew what I had to do! I hired some muscle and we got this place fixed up right quick.
FO300011840	I had the great fortune to run into Mr. Burke, an absolute gem of a man. He certainly has a way of getting done what needs to get done, doesn't he?
FO300011841	Then it was a matter of getting the right type of tenants with the right type of assets, and the rest is, as they say, history.
FO300011842	Indeed! I'm extremely impressed!
FO300011843	Yes. The healing art is a rewarding occupation. Is there something I can help you with?
FO300011844	Being a doctor is a great service to a community.
FO300011845	Your taste in shopping venue is impeccable. How may I assist you?
FO300011846	Nice place you have here.
FO300011847	Very kind of you to say so. Thank you!
FO300011848	And a pretty smile it is!
FO300011849	I see, sir. Very well. May I pour you a drink?
FO300011850	I'd love a drink, friend.
FO300011851	With my fashion sense and your bottlecaps, there's no limit to what we can do for your image! I can't wait to get started!
FO300011852	You really think you can improve my look?
FO300011853	You too.
FO300011854	Great. Good luck on the G.O.A.T.
FO300011855	Sure thing. How about we head down to the diner after class?
FO300011856	Thanks. Say, you want to grab some lunch later on?
FO300011857	Well, I hope it's working again soon for you.
FO300011858	Yeah, sure did. But the thing is so old, my grandpa had trouble with it when he was my age.
FO300011859	You're kidding me. Didn't you just get new parts for it last week?
FO300011860	Oh, not much. Our heater's on the fritz again.
FO300011861	Hi, Susie. What's new?
FO300011862	And if your friends decided to jump into the reactor, would you join them? Get your posterior in a chair immediately.
FO300011863	Mr. Brotch, come on! I gotta meet my friends!
FO300011864	There's more to this than you realize, Button.
FO300011865	Please explain, but I warn you, I am well versed on the tactics of the underhanded Redcoat spy. You'd do well to remember that.
FO300011866	Ummm, allow me to ponder my decision.
FO300011867	Very well, but any attempt to take the Declaration of Independence will be considered an act of war.
FO300011868	You do realize that it's about 500 years later, don't you?
FO300011869	Petty lies and deceit may be the way of Great Britain's crown, but I will not succumb to such tomfoolery.
FO300011870	Since it appears you wish to resolve this without bloodshed, may I suggest you stand down and surrender?
FO300011871	I can promise that you will be treated well; in a manner accustomed to any member of the Royal Army.
FO300011872	MQ05DadLiDeathScene
FO300011873	Please. Just monitor the pumps.
FO300011874	Madison, please. It's very important that you do this right now. Just step over to the panel while I access the computer in the control booth.
FO300011875	I need you to monitor the output levels on pumps three and four. Please step over to the panel and keep an eye on them, will you?
FO300011876	I won't help you do this James. Not after everything it took to get here.
FO300011877	James, this is wrong. You can't do this.
FO300011878	Why would you do all that over a scrap of paper?
FO300011879	This is no mere scrap of paper, sir. This is the doctrine laid down by my fellow members of the Second Continental Congress.
FO300011880	It absolves us of the tyranny of King George the Third of Great Britain. It is perhaps the greatest symbol of this free nation.
FO300011881	This is no mere scrap of paper, madam. This is the doctrine laid down by my fellow members of the Second Continental Congress.
FO300011882	It absolves us of the tyranny of King George the Third of Great Britain. It is perhaps the greatest symbol of this free nation.
FO300011883	Get out of my way you lunatic!
FO300011884	If our house be on fire, without inquiring whether it was fired from within or without, we must try to extinguish it!

FO300011886	What are you talking about? You're a robot!
FO300011887	I am not a "robot." I am Button Gwinnett, second signer of the Declaration of Independence and distinguished representative from Georgia.
FO300011888	I know your fighting prowess far exceeds my own, but I will still duel you to the death if I must.

FO300011910	It's only a scratch, I'll be fine.
FO300011911	Yeah, they got me pretty good.
FO300011912	Yeah, can't take much more of that.

FO300011918	Hey now, get outta there. Just let me know if you need a drink.
FO300011919	Whoa, bud. That stuff belongs to the restaurant. Just ask me if you need a drink.
FO300011920	Hey buddy, Bar's over here if you need something.

FO300011931	Almost ready. I'm compiling the data now.
FO300011932	Just another minute, and I'll be done.
FO300011933	It'll only be a few more moments.
FO300011934	Enough of these delays.
FO300011935	I grow tired of waiting.
FO300011936	My patience wears thin.
FO300011937	Sounds good. Let me know if there are any changes.
FO300011938	No problem. I'll have my report ready this afternoon.
FO300011939	I'd just like to keep an eye on it.
FO300011940	I was just going over them. Something you're worried about?
FO300011941	Have you had a chance to look over these results?
FO300011942	Morning, Doc. How's things?
FO300011943	Morning, Jonas.
FO300011944	Sure, sounds good. I would have done it for free.
FO300011945	Yeah right. Good luck soldier. I'm not coming after you to rescue your ass if you get in trouble. You're on your own.
FO300011946	Roy Phillips and his gang are somewhere in Warrington Station Metro tunnels. They've barred the main entrance. Try going through the train yard.
FO300011947	I'll take it. And any other help you can offer.
FO300011948	Here, you can take this rifle and ammo. But don't waste it shooting at shadows.
FO300011949	Roy Phillips and his gang are somewhere in Warrington Station Metro tunnels. They've barred the main entrance. Try going through the train yard.
FO300011950	And here. You can take this rifle and ammo.
FO300011951	But you better not screw this up!
FO300011952	Roy Phillips and his gang are somewhere in Warrington Station Metro tunnels. They've barred the main entrance. Try going through the train yard.
FO300011953	We'll see.
FO300011954	Whatever.
FO300011955	I was just kidding. Ghouls are filthy creatures that should be slaughtered.
FO300011956	Quite right! You're not such a moron after all.
FO300011957	That can be arranged. You don't look like much.
FO300011958	Are you threatening me? You're obviously an idiot, so I'll let that one slide. But I'm warning you, I won't hesitate to kill you if I have to.
FO300011959	Whatever. It's not really any of my business.
FO300011960	No, but perhaps it might be.
FO300011961	Yeah, Ghouls are too much trouble.
FO300011962	That's right. You never know when they'll go zombie on your ass. Perhaps you're smarter than you look.
FO300011963	You're all bigots.
FO300011964	Your bleeding heart is liable to get you in a lot of trouble one day.
FO300011965	Look kid, eventually all Ghouls go zombie on your ass. It's only a matter of time.
FO300011966	Kill them when you find them. It's a win-win. You put them out of their misery, and save someone else from getting torn apart.
FO300011967	MS12ResidentsGhoulsHelp
FO300011968	Like I tell my men: Don't bother reporting in, unless it's to tell me you got the job done.
FO300011969	I'm still working on getting rid of Roy Phillips and his pack of Ghouls.
FO300011970	Really? You? You're welcome to give it a try. But don't come crying to me when you get hurt.
FO300011971	They've holed up in the nearby metro tunnels. They're living with packs of Feral Ghouls. Be careful, Roy seems damn close to turning zombie himself.
FO300011972	I suppose you won't be doing this out of the kindness of your heart, huh?
FO300011973	How's 500 bottlecaps sound? Payable upon termination of that damn Ghoul, Roy Phillips, and all his followers.
FO300011974	I can help with your Ghoul problem. Where are they hiding out?
FO300011975	Perhaps the residents could be "persuaded" to let the Ghouls live here.
FO300011976	You're out of line. Those filthy bitches can stay living in those metro tunnels. They'll move in here over my dead body.
FO300011977	Have you even tried talking to the Ghouls? I bet you can work something out.
FO300011978	Tenpenny doesn't care how big their pile of bottlecaps is. He won't let Ghouls live here. Those Ghouls need to give up and go bother someone else.
FO300011979	Those Ghouls got you scared too, huh?
FO300011980	<Say nothing.>
FO300011981	Thanks.
FO300011982	Yeah, good luck with that.
FO300011983	We shall simply have to ignore them until they bugger off.
FO300011984	Cheers.
FO300011985	It's more than just interesting. It's positively horrible!
FO300011986	That's interesting.
FO300011987	If you don't mind, I have something things to attend to.
FO300011988	Yep.
FO300011989	Yeah. Thanks.
FO300011990	Good luck.
FO300011991	I suppose it is, isn't it?
FO300011992	It's only a matter of time.
FO300011993	That's not the word I'd use for it, comrade.
FO300011994	Interesting.
FO300011995	I wish I was as unconcerned as you.
FO300011996	Whatever.
FO300011997	You're a bit of a loser, aren't you?
FO300011998	<Say nothing.>
FO300011999	Don't care? You might one day.
FO300012000	Sure. Whatever you say.
FO300012001	If there's nothing else, I have better things to be doing right now.
FO300012002	Whatever.

FO300012004	I wonder if Ghouls will like your cooking?
FO300012005	You ever wonder if maybe you drink too much?
FO300012006	You ever wonder what those Ghouls think of you, and your snobby friends?
FO300012007	What? Why, I do believe you are being quite rude! Goodbye.
FO300012008	It's pretty sad, isn't it. Not being the center of everyone's attention?
FO300012009	I don't suppose you've consulted any Ghouls on your little theory?
FO300012010	I make it a point to stay clear of trouble.
FO300012011	What are you suggesting by that? I don't think I like your tone!
FO300012012	I'll go tell them there's nothing here worth dying over.
FO300012013	Are you mocking me, comrade?
FO300012014	Perhaps, comrade, the Ghouls will join your committee, comrade.
FO300012015	Perhaps you're right. But, I prefer to keep my nightmares a fantasy and not test my luck with the real thing. Thank you very much.
FO300012016	It's only natural to be afraid of the unknown...
FO300012017	I was hoping we could get to know each other better. What was I thinking?
FO300012018	I was hoping we could get along. What was I thinking?
FO300012019	You're lucky old men learn patience. But keep pushing your luck and I'll teach you a thing or two.
FO300012020	Better let the young folks handle things, old timer.
FO300012021	Ahem. I advise you to speak more civilly. Perhaps you can go enlighten Chief Gustavo. I have pressing "evil minion" things to do.
FO300012022	For an evil minion, you're not very bright. You can't "contain" Ghouls.
FO300012023	MS12ResidentsGhoulsChoiceGood
FO300012024	Really? That'd be wonderful. Talk to Chief Gustavo about it.
FO300012025	I might be able to do something.
FO300012026	Yeah? Talk to Gustavo. He may wish to employ your assistance.
FO300012027	I might be able to help deal with the problem.
FO300012028	Really? It's your funeral I suppose. You'll want to discuss it with Chief Gustavo first.
FO300012029	I might be able to take care of your unwanted neighbors.
FO300012030	Really? How? Wait! I don't really want to know - it probably entails something wickedly awful - just talking about it will give me the jeepers.
FO300012031	Chief Gustavo will want to know you will help. He might even be able to offer you something for your troubles.
FO300012032	I can take care of your little problem for you.
FO300012033	I wish you luck. You'll want to talk to Chief Gustavo first. He may be able to lend you a soldier or two.
FO300012034	I can take care of this problem once and for all.
FO300012035	Really? Perhaps you can. We'd all be terribly grateful. Chief Gustavo will want to know you're willing to help.
FO300012036	I can handle those Ghouls.
FO300012037	Hmm. You're certainly welcome to try, aren't you? Talk to Chief Gustavo.
FO300012038	I might be able to solve this problem.
FO300012039	Excellent. Speak with comrade Gustavo. He'll know what to do.
FO300012040	Really? Chief Gustavo is going to want to hear about that. You should talk to him right away.
FO300012041	Don't worry. I'll take care of the problem.
FO300012042	You're something else. Not like these other losers.
FO300012043	I'll take care of those Ghouls. Stop worrying about it.
FO300012044	Hmm. We might get to be friends after all. You're not so bad.
FO300012045	I'll take care of those Ghouls. Stop worrying about it.
FO300012046	Aha! An adventurous soul like myself. If I wasn't retired, I might come with you myself.
FO300012047	I can take care of this Ghoul situation, no problem.
FO300012048	If you can do a better job than Chief Gustavo, perhaps you can go enlighten him. I have important matters to attend to. If you'll excuse me?
FO300012049	Contained? Don't you want a permanent solution?
FO300012050	About these Ghouls...
FO300012051	That damn Roy Phillips won't take no for an answer. Keeps showing up, looking for a handout. He and his kind aren't wanted. End of story.
FO300012052	If I were a betting man, I'd place a stack of caps on him trying something violent soon.
FO300012053	And that would make Tenpenny nervous. I don't like it when Tenpenny gets nervous.
FO300012054	But I can't spare the manpower to go hunt down Roy Phillips and his band of misfits, or I'd gladly end this thing once and for all.
FO300012055	How's that Ghoul situation coming along?
FO300012056	If they got in here, they'd get their filth over everything. You can smell them a mile away!
FO300012057	I hope they come back and get killed by security.
FO300012058	Are you afraid of the Ghouls trying to get into Tenpenny?
FO300012059	They were told they can't live here. But those zombies are too stupid to understand.
FO300012060	They live in their own filth, squatting in the nearby metro tunnel. Security keeps shooting them, but they keep coming back.
FO300012061	Are you worried about those Ghouls?
FO300012062	Don't you worry about any such thing, sir. Care to wet your whistle?
FO300012063	You know anything about those Ghouls trying to get in here?
FO300012064	I'm sure it will end in bloodshed. It's serious business, comrade.
FO300012065	What do you think of the whole situation with the Ghouls?
FO300012066	They're living in the nearby tunnels. They scare me!
FO300012067	Why doesn't somebody do something!
FO300012068	You know anything about these Ghouls?
FO300012069	Are you going to do something about the problem, or not?
FO300012070	Those Ghouls sure have people worked up, don't they?
FO300012071	Some Ghouls moved into the nearby Metro tunnel. There's a bunch of the so-called Feral Ghouls in there, but a handful seem the sociable type.
FO300012072	I've tried explaining to my fellow tenants that not all Ghouls are monsters. But they don't seem to care.
FO300012073	The intelligent ones should stay away from our trigger happy protectors. If there're enough feral ones though, they could overwhelm security.
FO300012074	Are you doing something about those Ghouls?
FO300012075	Chief Gustavo assures us that he's increased the number of the security team, and will kill any zombies on sight.
FO300012076	Those Ghouls have you stressed out, too?
FO300012077	We haven't discussed this already? Apparently there's a pack of zombies living in the tunnels. Gustavo says he has it under control.
FO300012078	On the bright side, it's given me another reason to hit the drink!
FO300012079	I don't suppose you know much about those Ghouls?
FO300012080	There's a pack of zombies living nearby in some old tunnel. They asked to move in. Naturally, they were told to go to hell.
FO300012081	Gustavo's hired some additional goons. Seems to be working. Still, makes one a bit fidgety having those loathsome creatures around.
FO300012082	I wouldn't even want them as slaves!
FO300012083	Do you know anything useful about those Ghouls?
FO300012084	Hear anything interesting about the Ghouls?
FO300012085	My current theory is that the destructive disease of the Ghoul condition will always eventually render him little more than a mindless killer.
FO300012086	The proverbial Wasteland "zombie"  with a predilection for raw human flesh.
FO300012087	They can't be cured. And there's nothing to alleviate the symptoms. All in all, it seems rather sad, really.
FO300012088	Know much about those Ghouls?
FO300012089	What's it like living at Tenpenny Tower?
FO300012090	Tenpenny is always on time with the money. And we get fairly comfortable digs with side benefits.
FO300012091	It's a piece of Utopia jutting up from the Wasteland. Tenpenny is a true visionary. I do my part to assist him in unfolding his Master Plan.
FO300012092	This tower is the symbol of true progress in this world! People are dying to get in here. Just ask those Ghouls.
FO300012093	It's a great place to live. I've always dreamed of giving people fresh meals, and a place to relax and enjoy a good conversation or two.
FO300012094	Tenpenny gave me a place to do that. I'm greatly indebted to him for that.
FO300012095	It's THE place to live. The only place one finds any modicum of civilization and breeding.
FO300012096	Of course those Ghouls are trying to move in here. Can you fancy that? Disgusting zombies? Living in a place like this? Ahahaha! Really now!
FO300012097	Things haven't been the same since those Ghouls showed up. Has everyone on edge.
FO300012098	Tenpenny is a classy place. Just look at me. Look at my shop. Can't find top shelf class like that anywhere else.
FO300012099	People are healthy here, they eat well and have a strong roof over their head.
FO300012100	Only those deserving to live here can afford it. And let me tell you, those who do, live in style!
FO300012101	Well comrade, things are great. The best of the best have made a community here.
FO300012102	Well, there is that problem with the Ghouls. But I think it'll be solved soon enough.
FO300012103	It's very clean and safe here. Well, mostly safe. They say those Ghouls won't get in. But I don't know.
FO300012104	Beats living out there in Wasteland, trust me. See, I'm not like these other puffed up fogies. I earned my way into privilege. I worked to get here.
FO300012105	Well, until recently the only danger you ever faced in this fine establishment, was bumping into all the bloated egos floating around.
FO300012106	Problem is, it's hard to tell which is which. Chief Gustavo has initiated a shoot first and ask later policy. If they're smart, they'll stay away.
FO300012107	"I'm sorry" isn't good enough.
FO300012108	I'm afraid there's nothing else I can offer. When Project Purity is finished, we can sit down and really talk. I'd like to work through this.
FO300012109	For now, I need to return to Rivet City. There's still much to do.
FO300012110	I assure you, I won't. I'm going to need your help.
FO300012111	Now that I have what I came for, I need to get to Rivet City right away.
FO300012112	I don't think so.
FO300012113	Your call, kid.
FO300012114	Go for the top shelf. On me. <Give 20 caps.>
FO300012115	Whoa, twenty caps! Look at the big spender! Alright then, I can see you're in it for the big money, so I'll tell you all about Moriarty's.
FO300012116	Moriarty, he's a ratfuck bastard for sure, but he's also paranoid as all hell. So paranoid that he don't let no one handle the cash around here.
FO300012117	Every night, he takes what Gob and Nova earn and locks it in a file cabinet next to his bed.
FO300012118	Don't you know how a bribe works? You give me money, and I give you information. In order to do that, you have to have money. Christ. Kids!
FO300012119	This should buy you something. <Give 10 caps.>
FO300012120	Ha ha! You're gonna have to do better than that, kid! Thanks for the drink, though.
FO300012121	You're kidding. You don't have 10 caps? What kind of asshole doesn't even have ten fucking caps?
FO300012122	Whatever.
FO300012123	Quit bothering me with all this nonsense.
FO300012124	You're giving me a headache. Isn't there someone else you can pester with your inane ideas?
FO300012125	Who let you in here in the first place? Does Mister Tenpenny know there's a lunatic walking around his tower?
FO300012126	Um-hmm. Would you mind bothering someone else? PLEASE!
FO300012127	Why do you keep bothering me?
FO300012128	What if all your other neighbors agree?
FO300012129	Don't care. The only way those Ghoul's are getting in is over my dead body.
FO300012130	Ha! I know EVERYTHING about my neighbors, some things they don't even know themselves. I'm certain that they won't agree to this ridiculous idea.
FO300012131	And even if they did, I certainly won't!
FO300012132	Then my neighbors will have lost their minds. Just like you have. Now go away.
FO300012133	If my neighbors lose their minds and agree to such a thing, then I hope security shoots them in the head with their zombie friends.
FO300012134	There's no way they'd agree to letting Ghouls live here. We all came here to get away from things like Ghouls, and disease, and all that ugliness.
FO300012135	Good luck.
FO300012136	You'll get yours.
FO300012137	Yeah right. Watch your back.
FO300012138	When I die, it'll be your fault.
FO300012139	Whatever. My death will be on your head.
FO300012140	I got a plan. I'll talk to Tenpenny. I bet I can live in Burke's place. He's never around anyway.
FO300012141	And when he does come back, I'll make sure he's fine with the new arrangement.
FO300012142	I'll just send up for my food. I'll never even have to look at you or your Ghoul buddies.
FO300012143	I don't care. Get your stuff together and get out of here.
FO300012144	I never forget a slight. Watch your back. I'll be sending someone to pay you a little visit in the future.
FO300012145	My husband has connections. Watch your back.
FO300012146	Just you wait. I'll find a way to repay you for this.
FO300012147	You'll pay for this. Dearly.
FO300012148	I'm not going. I'll talk to Tenpenny. I bet I can live in Burke's place. He's never around anyway.
FO300012149	And when he does come back, I'll make sure he's fine with the new arrangement.
FO300012150	I'll just send up for my food. I'll never even have to look at you or your Ghoul buddies.
FO300012151	I'm sure you'll find something suitable, don't worry.
FO300012152	I found a comfortable place, but now I must leave. When I die, it will be on your head.
FO300012153	I already did. I hope one of your Ghoul buddies kills you. You'll see!
FO300012154	Don't worry? Did you just step out of a vault? Haven't you seen what's out there? I'm doomed. And it's all your fault!
FO300012155	The only suitable place is Tenpenny Tower. Everywhere else stinks and caters to low-life scum like you. I'll die out there. I just know it.
FO300012156	I'm not going anywhere. I'll talk to Tenpenny. I bet I can live in Burke's place. He's never around anyway.
FO300012157	And when he does come back, I'll make sure he's fine with the new arrangement.
FO300012158	I'll just send up for my food. I'll never even have to look at you or your Ghoul buddies.
FO300012159	This is happening. You're going to have to deal with it, or get forced out.
FO300012160	This is outrageous! Preposterous! Forced out by a bunch of dirty Ghouls, and some bleeding heart activist? Where will I live? How will I get there?
FO300012161	Damn it! This can't be happening! Why do you think I came here in the first place? To get away from Ghouls, monsters, and scum like you.
FO300012162	Now I'll have to start all over again. Where will I go?
FO300012163	You horrible little zombie-lover! What right do you and your disgusting buddies have to push honest, hardworking, important people around like that?
FO300012164	Where do you propose I live?
FO300012165	Grrr. You'll regret this. I've spent years collecting all this fabulous merchandise. I won't stand for this! Where the hell am I supposed to go?
FO300012166	I'm done with the Wasteland! And I've been everywhere else. There isn't anything better than this. Damn you and your Ghouls!
FO300012167	Would you tell Mister Tenpenny that you wouldn't mind Ghoul neighbors?
FO300012168	I guess so. Sure.
FO300012169	What the hell? Sure.
FO300012170	Sure. No problem.
FO300012171	Alright, comrade. We'll welcome them into the community.
FO300012172	I guess so.
FO300012173	Of course! I wonder if they've ever been to Underworld. Now there's an interesting vacation destination!
FO300012174	I must say, you can be quite the bore. Run along and pester someone else.
FO300012175	Whatever.
FO300012176	Are you done wasting my time?
FO300012177	Whatever.
FO300012178	Apathy is a condition of the present blight. In the future men will have passion and ideals again. Like Mister Tenpenny. Now, if you'll excuse me.
FO300012179	Whatever.
FO300012180	You're a little weird, aren't you?
FO300012181	Perhaps.
FO300012182	You're the one that asked the question. If you don't mind, I'd like to get another drink.
FO300012183	Perhaps.
FO300012184	Don't you have somewhere else you can go? Must you bother me?
FO300012185	Whatever.
FO300012186	I don't suppose you can find someone else to talk to?
FO300012187	Whatever.
FO300012188	My time is very important to me. I don't suppose you can waste your's somewhere else?
FO300012189	Whatever.
FO300012190	Is there something I can help you with? If not, why don't you find somewhere else to be?
FO300012191	Whatever.
FO300012192	Don't you have something better to do?
FO300012193	Whatever.
FO300012194	Whatever.
FO300012195	I just remembered I need to be someplace else.
FO300012196	Whatever.
FO300012197	Has anyone told you how annoying you are?
FO300012198	Whatever.
FO300012199	Don't start conversations you aren't interested in finishing.
FO300012200	Whatever.
FO300012201	Well, that's how most people feel, certainly. Talk to Security Chief Gustavo. He's managing the "Ghoul situation."
FO300012202	I was just kidding! Those zombies need to be killed!
FO300012203	So why the hell would you even suggest such a retarded idea? Are you done wasting my time?
FO300012204	Yeah, Ghouls don't belong here.
FO300012205	It best not to dwell on such things.
FO300012206	In time, after Tenpenny's projects have come to fruition, things like Ghouls and other deformations nature will be a thing of the past.
FO300012207	Ghouls are disgusting, aren't they?
FO300012208	I agree, though I wonder if they can help it. They seem rather pathetic, don't they? It seems like a horrible way to have to live.
FO300012209	You're right. Ghouls are disgusting.
FO300012210	So I've heard. I have to wonder though, if they are all mindless killing machines, why do some of them want to be treated like humans so badly?
FO300012211	It's wise to be afraid of Ghouls. They'll kill you when you aren't looking.
FO300012212	Indeed they are. Someone really should put them all out of there misery, don't you think?
FO300012213	Yeah. Ghouls are disgusting creatures.
FO300012214	So why would you even suggest they live here? Or were you kidding?
FO300012215	Hahaha! That's funny.
FO300012216	Yeah. Ghouls are disgusting creatures.
FO300012217	I'm not afraid. Just cautious. But perhaps you're right. It's better not to take chances.
FO300012218	You're a wise man, Banfield. Ghouls are meant to be feared.
FO300012219	Quite right. Perhaps you're not as stupid as you seem.
FO300012220	Yeah, Ghouls would make horrible neighbors.
FO300012221	You don't have to tell me that.
FO300012222	Yeah. Ghouls are disgusting creatures.
FO300012223	Indeed, comrade. Indeed. I wonder though, if they might also need their own community?
FO300012224	It's wise to be afraid of Ghouls.
FO300012225	It's wise to be afraid of Ghouls.
FO300012226	They sure are, so why suggest they move in here? Or, were you joking? Well, you aren't very funny.
FO300012227	Yeah. Ghouls are disgusting creatures.
FO300012228	Yes. Many will chew off your arm if given the chance. It's true. But they aren't all bad.
FO300012229	It's wise to be afraid of Ghouls.
FO300012230	MS12ResidentsNeighborsGood
FO300012231	Ha! I don't suppose I'd mind terribly if Ghouls were to live here. And it'd be a good bit of sport hunting them down if they misbehaved.
FO300012232	I dare say though, you'll have a bit of trouble convincing certain residents to go along with your novel proposition.
FO300012233	Tell you what. If you can convince  Mr. and Mrs. Wellington, Mr. Ling, Ms. Montenegro, and Ms. Lancaster, those Ghouls can live here.
FO300012234	Have you seen me shoot? I'm quite proficient, if I do say so myself.
FO300012235	What if the residents are okay with Ghoul neighbors?
FO300012236	What if Tenpenny will let Ghouls live here?
FO300012237	In time, after Tenpenny's projects have come to fruition, things like ghouls and other aberrations of nature will be a thing of the past.
FO300012238	These times are the crucible for a glorious future. One shouldn't be overly concerned with who gets burned in the process.
FO300012239	Tenpenny seems rather heartless.
FO300012240	I don't know. As long as they don't cause trouble. And they'd have to try to fit in with our established community.
FO300012241	I guess I'd be willing to give it a try.
FO300012242	What if they kept themselves clean and didn't bother anyone?
FO300012243	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
FO300012244	I'm afraid that I can't abide by that. I can't imagine Tenpenny would allow it. But I certainly won't.
FO300012245	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
FO300012246	Ha! I think I know a fair share more than some vagrant blown in off the Wastes. You are simply mistaken.
FO300012247	They may appear nice, but deep down they want to kill. It's common knowledge among the educated.
FO300012248	You clearly don't know what you are talking about!
FO300012249	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
FO300012250	I suppose I wouldn't mind too terribly. It'd give me a chance to study Ghoul physiology.
FO300012251	I've met these ghouls. They seem healthy. All things considered.
FO300012252	I think you must have been out in the sun too long. Perhaps I could sell you a nice hat to keep your brain from frying?
FO300012253	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
FO300012254	Why would you hang out with dirty vermin like that? You enjoy sifting through feces?
FO300012255	You know it's only a matter of time before they get hungry and eat you. You're crazy. Ghouls will never live in Tenpenny Tower.
FO300012256	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
FO300012257	Well, perhaps you're right, comrade. Some of these folk have a few things to learn about camaraderie, that's for sure.
FO300012258	Comrade, I've met these ghouls. They seem friendly enough. More than this lot.
FO300012259	And if they do anything stupid, I'm sure they'll get kicked out. Fine, it's ok.
FO300012260	I've met these Ghouls. They seem friendly enough.
FO300012261	Well, if you don't mind their stink, then you should go squat with them in their dirty tunnels, and leave us civilized people alone.
FO300012262	I've met these Ghouls. They aren't so bad.
FO300012263	Like I said, it's fine by me.
FO300012264	So you wouldn't mind if some civilized Ghouls moved in?
FO300012265	How would you feel about having a few Ghoul neighbors?
FO300012266	HELL NO! Tenpenny won't allow it. And I take my orders from him.
FO300012267	After Tenpenny died, I assumed full command. And since I hate Ghouls, I guess the answer to that question is pretty damn clear.
FO300012268	Those Ghouls can live here over my goddamn body!
FO300012269	However, the Ghoulish state is a bitter reminder that things aren't yet in line with Mister Tenpenny's vision for a pure and stainless future.
FO300012270	So you see, Ghouls living here is simply out of the question.
FO300012271	I know you've been pressuring people into allowing Ghouls to live here.
FO300012272	Who do you think you are, harassing honest people like that? You should be ashamed of yourself! I certainly won't allow Ghouls to live here.
FO300012273	My neighbors might be out of their minds, but I am not. Those Ghouls will NOT be living here.
FO300012274	Ah yes. I was wondering when you'd try me.
FO300012275	You may be able to coerce the others, but I'm not such a pushover. Your zombie buddies will need to find someplace else to live.
FO300012276	It's my turn, eh? Well, you won't be getting me to go along with your ridiculous plan.
FO300012277	Ghouls aren't human. They live in filth. They eat their own babies. You're out of your right freaking mind!
FO300012278	I know all about your plan to get your Ghoul pals in here, and I'm putting a stop to it. You can't just go around pushing us around like that!
FO300012279	So you can run along and tell your Ghouls they'll just have to find somewhere else to squat. Or better yet, to go off and die somewhere.
FO300012280	And I've decided that I'd be willing to give it a go. Having Ghoul neighbors, I mean.
FO300012281	Who knows, I could even publish my findings!
FO300012282	You've finally got around to asking me, comrade.
FO300012283	I've given it a lot of careful thought. I would welcome these Ghouls into our community.
FO300012284	I've already formed a welcoming committee!
FO300012285	It's my turn, eh? I'm still worried, but if the others are willing to let them live here, I guess I could try it. But they better behave!
FO300012286	I've heard they carry diseases. I'd have to sanitize everything after them all the time. Besides, they are dangerous, aren't they?
FO300012287	You've heard the stories I'm sure. About the mindless ones eating brains and the like. Well, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with all that.
FO300012288	Haha. You're joking right? You're serious? Of course not! Ghouls can't live here. They're dirty loathsome creatures.
FO300012289	Dear lord. Are you serious? Ghouls living here? With us? That's simply out of the question.
FO300012290	I'm not sure. My first responsibility is the health and welfare of the residents of Tenpenny Tower.
FO300012291	Ghouls often carry diseases due to radiation damaging their immune systems.
FO300012292	You're being serious? That's out of the question. What an absurd notion!
FO300012293	You can't be serious. Ghouls aren't human. They live in filth. They eat their own babies. You're out of your right freakin' mind!
FO300012294	Don't have any data in my files about that.
FO300012295	Ghouls wouldn't make the best of neighbors, comrade.
FO300012296	I don't know. I mean, they're all deformed and scary looking. I bet they're really mean, too.
FO300012297	I've come too far to share my digs with some droopy Ghoul!
FO300012298	Well, I wouldn't mind. But they'd better be civilized. The tenants here are real uppity and most wouldn't take kindly to Ghouls living here.
FO300012299	I've already told you no!
FO300012300	I believe I've told you NO!
FO300012301	It's not happening.
FO300012302	I will not allow Ghouls to live here.
FO300012303	I'm really tired of you and your Ghoul crusade.
FO300012304	I wouldn't mind. It would certainly liven things up around here, that's for sure!
FO300012305	Oh what the hell? It's not like anything interesting happens around here anyway.
FO300012306	It would give me a chance to do my own study of Ghoul physiology.
FO300012307	It's not really fair to deprive anyone of a community, is it? So we really ought to welcome them as comrades, shouldn't we?
FO300012308	If they behave, I suppose it'd be okay with me.
FO300012309	Okay pops, just hand over the reward and you can get back to your history books.
FO300012310	Well! The founding fathers would be disappointed in your fiery tone.
FO300012311	However, a deal is a deal. Here is your reward.
FO300012312	Thank you, it's quite an honor. Now, for my reward?
FO300012313	Please, accept this holotape as a token of my esteem and the esteem of every citizen of the United States.
FO300012314	May it bring you the vocal skills possessed by only the greatest orators of our time.
FO300012315	I have the Declaration of Independence.
FO300012316	You have earned your place in the annals of American History, yes indeed. You will be remembered for this great day!
FO300012317	I understand the road was difficult, so allow me to present you with an extra bonus to perhaps whet your appetite for future endeavors.
FO300012318	Enjoy your reward, my friend. You've earned it.
FO300012319	You have earned your place in the annals of American History, yes indeed. You will be remembered for this great day!
FO300012320	I understand the road was difficult, so allow me to present you with an extra bonus to perhaps whet your appetite for future endeavors.
FO300012321	Enjoy your reward, my friend. You've earned it.
FO300012322	Whatever. A shotgun would have been nice.
FO300012323	I'm sorry you feel that way. Maybe you haven't grown up as much as I'd thought. If you don't want it, I'm sure I can find someone who does.
FO300012324	I'm sorry you feel that way. Maybe you haven't grown up as much as I'd thought. If you don't want it, I'm sure I can find someone who does.
FO300012325	I didn't want a stupid BB Gun for my birthday.
FO300012326	You're an asshole, Jericho.
FO300012327	You love me.
FO300012328	Funny. I'll take my caps back now.
FO300012329	Alright, alright, I'm just fucking with you.
FO300012330	Thanks for the info, Jericho.
FO300012331	Anytime. It'll be worth it to see the look on that asshole's face.
FO300012332	Sounds risky. What if he catches me?
FO300012333	He'll probably blow your head off. That is, unless you can draw faster than a pissed off Irishman.
FO300012334	Why haven't you robbed him?
FO300012335	My robbin' days are over, kid. I'm just here to drink and stink.
FO300012336	So where's the key?
FO300012337	How did you know my father?
FO300012338	I have been a part of the Brotherhood for many years. Enough that I was here when Project Purity first began.
FO300012339	I did not work directly with your father; he and his team valued their independence, and I respected that.
FO300012340	Fine, whatever. Let's get to it.
FO300012341	I find your attitude and lack of respect insulting.
FO300012342	I need to find a G.E.C.K.
FO300012343	Are you quite sure? I suspect that would be a waste of time. Regardless, the Brotherhood is not in possession of such a device.
FO300012344	There is, however, a way in which we may be able to ascertain the location of one.
FO300012345	It may be possible to locate one, however.
FO300012346	Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Are you going to help or not?
FO300012347	Taking the loss in stride, are we?
FO300012348	It would seem the Brotherhood has more pressing matters to attend to than a twenty year old, defunct project.
FO300012349	Out of respect for your father, however, I will offer advice. What exactly do you need?
FO300012350	Thanks for your sympathy.
FO300012351	Think nothing of it.
FO300012352	Now, Doctor Li has explained your predicament. You need to locate some Vault-Tec equipment?
FO300012353	Well, I must speak to my husband about that. We could bring it up at the next homeowner's association meeting.
FO300012354	Ah, I do love the meetings so much. I think I'll bring muffins!
FO300012355	Wow, are you batshit insane or what?
FO300012356	Well now, there's no cause for name calling! How rude!
FO300012357	I have a pie cooling on the window sill I must attend to. Good day!
FO300012358	Why are you being so hostile?
FO300012359	Maybe it's because my wife has gone mental. No wait, I think it's because some lunatics are trying to kill us.
FO300012360	Other than that, no reason.
FO300012361	What the hell is your problem?
FO300012362	Do you understand English? I said get out!
FO300012363	Yeah right, and the second I drop my guard you pounce. No thanks.
FO300012364	Look, speak your piece then leave.
FO300012365	Calm down, pal, before I put a hole in your chest.
FO300012366	Look, "pal,", there is no way you're going to get to me or my wife so just back on out of here!
FO300012367	So, what's your take on Evan King?
FO300012368	He's a spineless wimp. His best solution to the Family is to stay inside our homes and hide. What does that tell them?
FO300012369	It tells them that we can be pushed around whenever they want. I'm sick of it, and I'm sick of King.
FO300012370	Well, he's town mayor or sheriff or whatever he calls himself. He calls all the shots.
FO300012371	When he says to get the heck indoors and stay put, we do that.
FO300012372	You've made the right choice, Leo.
FO300012373	Thanks. It'll be hard, but I'll do my best.
FO300012374	I could tell them for you.
FO300012375	No. Thanks, but no. I got myself into this problem, I need to get myself out.
FO300012376	I'll figure something out. Look, I want to thank you for your help. I guess it took a complete stranger to show me what an ass I've been.
FO300012377	That would be a good idea.
FO300012378	I just don't know what to say. I've been stealing from both of them for years to get my fix. Where do I even start?
FO300012379	Well, I'll figure something out. Look, I want to thank you for your help. I guess it took a complete stranger to show me what an ass I've been.
FO300012380	I never thought about it that way. Can you hook me up?
FO300012381	I'll only sell to you when my shift is over. Meet me in the water treatment plant if you need something.
FO300012382	You're hurting your family, Leo. Jenny and Andy care about you.
FO300012383	Never mind, Leo. It's not my business, anyway.
FO300012384	You're damn right it's not your business.
FO300012385	What's it worth to you to keep it out of the public eye?
FO300012386	I can hook you up. A solid chem dealer is hard to find out here in the Wastes, trust me. I know.
FO300012387	I can only sell to you when my shift at the Lantern is over. Meet me up at the water treatment plant if you need something.
FO300012388	It's okay, Leo. I want to help.
FO300012389	Help? What's to help? So I'm a junkie, big fucking deal. It's not like I'm hurting anyone.
FO300012390	It's about damn time.
FO300012391	Indeed. Farewell.
FO300012392	Thanks for the help.
FO300012393	You are welcome. If you require further assistance, I may be able to help.
FO300012394	I'm running short on time, here. Let's cut to the chase.
FO300012395	I elected to take time from my responsibilities to assist you. Perhaps I was in error. Nonetheless, we may have what you seek.
FO300012396	In the archives upstairs is an old, pre-war Vault-Tec terminal. I will send word that you need access to it.
FO300012397	Can you give me some information about Arefu?
FO300012398	Sure, be glad to since you're doing me a big favor and all.
FO300012399	I need to find Vault 87 right now.
FO300012400	I take it you were successful, then.
FO300012401	As it happens, the Brotherhood has some information about Vault 87. Let me show you what we know.
FO300012402	I see.
FO300012403	As it happens, the Brotherhood has some information about Vault 87. Let me show you what we know.
FO300012404	I can handle it.
FO300012405	Can you now, without even knowing what the problem is?
FO300012406	I suppose, then, you have a way to deal with lethal levels of radiation around the Vault?
FO300012407	Why, what's difficult about it?
FO300012408	The area is highly irradiated; lethal levels are all around the entrance. Gaining direct access will be quite impossible.
FO300012409	Vault 87 has a G.E.C.K., but I don't know where it is.
FO300012410	Ah. Well, that much I believe I can help with.
FO300012411	Step over here for a moment. I'll show you where it is.
FO300012412	RadioGNRDashwoodEp3
FO300012413	Quite right. We've been trying to capture these Rockopolis rodents for years. Never could have done it without you, Daring.
FO300012414	I knew it! I knew this dame was no good! But it's worse than I thought. She's the Black Widow! The leader of the Slavers!
FO300012415	Jabber all you want. In about 30 seconds, my associates from Paradise Falls will join us.
FO300012416	Here I thought we were friends. And now you have a gun in my face. Bad form, Miss Chase. Bad form.
FO300012417	Oh, I don't know, Daring darling. I find the ghoul's instincts to be... frighteningly accurate.
FO300012418	Listen to yourself, boss! This is Rockopolis! One of the safest places in the Wasteland, and you just showed a stranger where it is!
FO300012419	Oh, no, Miss Chase! I can assure you, this will be our special place.
FO300012420	Now that's what I call a getaway, Daring! So tell me, do you take all your girlfriends here?
FO300012421	So you do know where it is! Well come on then, those Super Mutants can't be far behind!
FO300012422	Now now, old chum! Miss Chase is hardly going to violate the secrets of Rockopolis. Isn't that right, Miss Chase? Besides, necessity calls!
FO300012423	Turns out you're in good company, Miss Chase. Argyle and I are old friends of Rockopolis. Know the secret knock and everything!
FO300012424	Screw this. I'm out of here.
FO300012425	Like it or not, you're stuck up here too. You can't go back.
FO300012426	So, either you stay here and run out of ammunition like we did, or we all work together and get off this roof.
FO300012427	I'd like to help, but nothing's free.
FO300012428	Heh heh. Spoken just like a merc.
FO300012429	You get us off of here, and I guarantee you'll be paid well.
FO300012430	Now, I'd suggest we go back the way you came, but I think that may be impossible. Our only chance is this express elevator to the lobby level.
FO300012431	Yeah, let's do it.
FO300012432	I know you don't know me from the shit under your boots, but I promise you when we get out of this you'll be paid well for it.
FO300012433	I'd suggest we go back the way you came, but I think that may be impossible. Our only chance is this express elevator to the lobby level.
FO300012434	I don't know a Reilly, and I'm out of here.
FO300012435	Well, I got news for you. You're stuck up here like the rest of us. There's no going back the way you came.
FO300012436	So what'll it be? You going to help us get off this roof or what?
FO300012437	I don't know any Reilly, but I do know we need to get the hell off this roof.
FO300012438	She didn't send you? Dammit, that means she might be dead.
FO300012439	Forget it then, we can talk shop later. Can you help us get out of here?
FO300012440	Reilly? Who's that? Never heard of her.
FO300012441	She's our commander. I hope she's still alive. When I saw you come up here, I assumed she'd sent you.
FO300012442	Well, we can chit-chat about all that later. Right now, can you help us get off this damn roof?
FO300012443	He really shouldn't be here.
FO300012444	I think this is the best place for him. Out there, he'd be hunted like all of us were. Sorry.
FO300012445	I could be his friend.
FO300012446	Well, that is sweet, but Vance would kick my rather gorgeous ass right out of here if I told you how to find Ian. Sorry.
FO300012447	Ian's decided to stay with the Family.
FO300012448	When you first arrived I was suspicious of your intentions. I can see now it was an error in judgement.
FO300012449	I can assure you Ian will be well cared for and safe with the Family.
FO300012450	Please, I want you to take this. Consider it as an apology to you for all the hardships you had to endure finding this place.
FO300012451	Ian's decided to leave the Family.
FO300012452	It saddens me to lose one of my flock, but I believe everyone has to follow their own path.
FO300012453	All I was attempting to do was guide him. Now it seems that responsibility has fallen upon you. I hope you will be more successful.
FO300012454	Please, I want you to take this. Consider it as an apology to you for all the hardships you had to endure finding this place.
FO300012455	That's impressive. Competition must be stiff around here.
FO300012456	Damn right it is. Last time I checked, it wasn't called the "Sisterhood of Steel." Hell, even Sarah has to prove herself to the knuckle draggers.
FO300012457	Every once in a while, we have to show 'em what's what.
FO300012458	You mean you were the best shot. I'm here now.
FO300012459	Sorry, I was just joking around.
FO300012460	Please. Like I'm afraid of you people.
FO300012461	See? That. Right there. That's the sort of shit that'll land a little girl like you in the infirmary.
FO300012462	See? That. Right there. That's the sort of shit that gets a man injured.
FO300012463	Good to know.
FO300012464	Right to the point. I like that. What do you need?
FO300012465	Dusk? Oh, let me guess! Your real name's Dawn. Or is it Twilight?
FO300012466	Ha. Funny. Here's some free advice: You're our guest, so I'd be real careful about who you insult.
FO300012467	That sort of thing might fly out in the Wastes, but here in the Citadel, it'll earn you a few broken teeth.
FO300012468	So what's your story?
FO300012469	My "story"? I blow the head off of anything more'n two hundred meters downrange.
FO300012470	I'm the best shot in the Brotherhood of Steel, bar none. Not even Colvin can match my kill count. That's my "story."
FO300012471	CitElderLyonsMealBlessing2
FO300012472	Brothers, today I offer a simple prayer.
FO300012473	Hail, Creator. Blessed is your power and mighty is your gift of Steel.
FO300012474	Bless us today, your noble warriors who dwell in this hall.
FO300012475	Let us ride upon wings of thunder and chariots of glory, to bring destruction to your enemies.
FO300012476	To bring destruction upon your wicked enemies."
FO300012477	CitElderLyonsMealBlessing1
FO300012478	Brothers, as we take our meal this day, let us reflect upon the words of Elder Patrocolus of the Montana Bunker.
FO300012479	Pledge in your hearts and minds, pledge by your guns that you will stand with them in battle until the end. Trust each of them with your life.
FO300012480	And earn the trust of each in turn. Eat well, my friends.
FO300012481	Can you repair my gear?
FO300012482	I should let you know: I'm not going to use any of our equipment to provide parts for you. You'll have to pay for them.
FO300012483	If you want to pay for the parts, yes.
FO300012484	I'd like to buy something.
FO300012485	I received word from Elder Lyons. He says that you have permission to trade with us. Good for you.
FO300012486	What do you need?
FO300012487	What is it?
FO300012488	What else would I be doing back here?
FO300012489	How do I get through the radiation?
FO300012490	Quite simply, you don't. To attempt such a thing would be certain death for you.
FO300012491	There's got to be another way.
FO300012492	You share your father's determination, it seems. And in this case, you are correct. There may well be another way.
FO300012493	Vault 87 is located very close to the site of Lamplight Caverns. It is entirely probable that the Vault may be entered from within the caves.
FO300012494	So that's it? I'm screwed?
FO300012495	There is, in fact, another potential way to reach the Vault. Lamplight Caverns is close by, and may provide an alternate means of access.
FO300012496	I really need to get by you. It's important I find what I'm looking for.
FO300012497	Alright, alright. I guess you look harmless enough.
FO300012498	If I were you, I'd speak to Vance before you poke around too much. You can usually find him on the mezzanine overlooking the common area.
FO300012499	Hang on a second. I have a letter for Ian West from his sister.
FO300012500	Oh, the new kid? Yeah, Vance said we should be expecting someone soon.
FO300012501	You can head on in, but I would speak to Vance first if I was you. You can find him on the mezzanine overlooking the common area.
FO300012502	I'm not telling you jack. Now let me get by!
FO300012503	Ok, sure. Look, I don't have time for your bullshit. Turn around and go back the way you came.
FO300012504	Otherwise, they'll be scraping you up with a shovel.
FO300012505	Just exploring, sorry.
FO300012506	Well, go explore somewhere else. This place is off limits to explorers.
FO300012507	He doesn't belong here.
FO300012508	How do you know that? If you've spoken to him like I have, I think you can see he's truly one of us.
FO300012509	Ian confides in me. We share a special bond. I might be the only friend in the world he's got!
FO300012510	He's needed at home. His family is dead.
FO300012511	Yes, I know. He told me.
FO300012512	Surprised? Well, Ian was there when it happened and did nothing to stop it. If you ask yourself why, the answer is obvious.
FO300012513	He belongs with us here. He's one of us. Don't deny him his rightful home.
FO300012514	Can't you just help out without being so mean?
FO300012515	Awwww. I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings? Sniff.
FO300012516	Tough shit! This is the real world. You want to know something, find it out your damn self.
FO300012517	You really have a bad attitude.
FO300012518	That's me. You don't like it? Tough!
FO300012519	I'm going to kick your ass all over this Metro station if you don't help me!
FO300012520	Finally! Someone with some balls around this place!
FO300012521	Great. Thanks for nothing.
FO300012522	I find it hard to believe your father raised such a child.
FO300012523	I feel pity for whatever it is you've gone through that has made you so bitter.
FO300012524	Thanks for your help.
FO300012525	I wish we could do more, but the Brotherhood potentially faces a very pressing, very real threat in the Enclave.
FO300012526	All of my efforts must now be devoted to assessing the threat they may pose to us. I'm sure you understand.
FO300012527	You're kidding me, right?
FO300012528	I ain't kidding. You're not supposed to be here, so you better leave.
FO300012529	Whoa, hold on there. I'm a friend.
FO300012530	You're big, and I don't have any big friends. You better just go out the way you came in.
FO300012531	I have no idea.
FO300012532	Then that is a mystery you will have to solve on your own.
FO300012533	Perhaps from these Laws you can discover what we are. Return to me when you are ready.
FO300012534	Not used to civilized discourse, eh? You're from out there in the Wasteland, right? You must be pretty tough to survive out there. Ever kill a Ghoul?
FO300012535	<Say nothing.>
FO300012536	You're lucky they even let you in here. I'm surprised they did, since it will only encourage those Ghouls who want to live here.
FO300012537	They don't understand they need to earn the right to live here.
FO300012538	Whatever.
FO300012539	If you don't mind, I have better things to do.
FO300012540	Like fixing up some pills to keep the residents bolstered against whatever diseases those Ghouls bring with them when they bang on the gate.
FO300012541	Sure. Whatever you say, doc.
FO300012542	You are in definite need of an attitude adjustment. Like those God-awful Ghouls scrabbling at the gate all the time.
FO300012543	Someone must do something to get rid of those vermin once and for all!
FO300012544	Blah blah blah!
FO300012545	I've never been in prison, so I wouldn't know. All I know is that I'm safe in here. Out there you got all kinds of nastiness. Like those Ghouls.
FO300012546	You ever run into Ghouls in your travels?
FO300012547	This place feels more like a prison than a home.
FO300012548	Lucky? Perhaps I should feel lucky. But really, we've all worked hard to get what we have. I think it's fair to say we DESERVE to live here.
FO300012549	Not everyone is as lucky as you.
FO300012550	Take those Ghouls out there. Tenpenny won't let them live here. Sure, it's a little sad, but that decision is keeping people in here safe and sound.
FO300012551	It must be nice having patients who can pay their medical bills, huh?
FO300012552	But luck has nothing to do with it. We deserve this. All of it. Not everyone is as smart, as pretty, or as wealthy as the cream of the crop.
FO300012553	Don't blame me. Blame mother nature. Survival of the fittest. It's the game of life. We're the winners. And those Ghouls, they are definitely losers.
FO300012554	I bet people are dying to live here. You're all lucky you can afford it.
FO300012555	Indeed. Though Tenpenny has put a lot of work into restoring it. And he's hired security to keep us safe.
FO300012556	But they seem to be having some trouble with a pack of Ghouls living in the tunnels nearby.
FO300012557	Don't suppose you've encountered many Ghouls on your travels?
FO300012558	Good thing the tower was still structurally sound after the war.
FO300012559	Indeed! Everyone who lives here has worked hard to get here.
FO300012560	That's why we can't just let those ghouls in. They demand the right to live here, but what have they done to prove themselves worthy?
FO300012561	Running a cafe can't be easy.
FO300012562	Tenpenny is very selective about who he allows to live here. The correct genes and living conditions make for a relatively disease free environment.
FO300012563	Clean water is still a concern, of course, but we've got enough chems to keep the radiation sickness at bay.
FO300012564	That's why he won't allow those Ghouls to live here. Why introduce a weakness into a healthy system?
FO300012565	I'm a little shocked by how healthy everyone looks.
FO300012566	And you can thank me for that. I'm the resident guide to all things fabulous.
FO300012567	I've noticed the quality of living is rather high here, isn't it?
FO300012568	Fine. Never mind. I thought you were a real man. Turns out you're just a scared little boy.
FO300012569	Ghouls aren't so bad, once you get to know them.
FO300012570	That's just what I thought. You're a scared little girl.
FO300012571	Ghouls aren't so bad, once you get to know them.
FO300012572	What? Have you lost your mind?
FO300012573	Ghouls are all right.
FO300012574	I guess I never thought of it that way. It's probably really hard just living day to day like that. Now I feel a little ashamed.
FO300012575	I think they've proven something just staying alive in that condition.
FO300012576	Look, I know enough about Ghouls not to hate them.
FO300012577	Then you obviously don't know anything about Ghouls.
FO300012578	I don't consider Ghouls to be a problem. If that's what you're asking.
FO300012579	I do hope you're not referring to me! I'm certainly a better conversationalist than some stupid Ghoul. And I smell better, too!
FO300012580	I'd rather spend time with Ghouls than some other people I know.
FO300012581	Sure they look a little weird, but they're not diseased vermin.
FO300012582	That's a silly question. What I have against Ghouls, is that they are Ghouls!
FO300012583	What do you have against Ghouls, anyway?
FO300012584	Perhaps you're right. My wife is always going on about how crazy I make her.
FO300012585	Don't worry about those Ghouls, comrade. You need to relax.
FO300012586	I wish I could. I get nightmares from time to time.
FO300012587	Stop worrying about those Ghouls.
FO300012588	Sure, I've met some Ghouls. They're just people, trying to get by.
FO300012589	Neither am I! I came here to get away from all that!
FO300012590	Someone really needs to take care of those Ghouls once and for all. Gustavo and his goons aren't doing the job.
FO300012591	Actually, I'm not a big fan of Ghouls.
FO300012592	Neither am I! I came here to get away from all that!
FO300012593	Something tells me you're a pretty tough chick. You made it in from the Wasteland after all. We could really use you're help around here.
FO300012594	Someone really needs to take care of those Ghouls once and for all. Gustavo and his goons aren't doing the job.
FO300012595	Actually, I'm not a big fan of Ghouls.
FO300012596	There must be something we can do. Talk to Gustavo, he might have some way for you to assist us in dealing with the problem.
FO300012597	Yeah, I wouldn't want Ghouls living here either.
FO300012598	They do seem a bit anti-social don't they?
FO300012599	Let's just say I never met a Ghoul I liked.
FO300012600	Indeed. Loathsome creatures aren't they? Someone really ought to put them out of their misery. You should talk to Gustavo about exterminating them.
FO300012601	I've seen lots of Ghouls. Hated every last one of them.
FO300012602	Perhaps you are smarter than appearances credit.
FO300012603	I don't like Ghouls any more than you do.
FO300012604	Yeah, it's what keeps those Ghouls from coming in.
FO300012605	It's a good thing those walls are so high.
FO300012606	Ha ha ha! You bet. But who would dare touch them to give it to them?
FO300012607	Most Ghouls are in need of a serious makeover. Huh? Am I right?
FO300012608	Committees won't help. You need to simply ignore them, or exterminate them.
FO300012609	Yeah. They make me nervous. They certainly are disturbing looking.
FO300012610	I've dealt with enough Ghouls to know I don't ever want to see one again.
FO300012611	If you weren't a child, I'd show you what this old man can do!
FO300012612	Only one thing I like less than Ghouls: old geezers giving me orders.
FO300012613	Well, that's not very brave, though it's not a bad policy either. If you decide to conquer your fear of Ghouls by killing a couple, talk to Gustavo.
FO300012614	When I see a Ghoul in the distance, I tend to turn around and go the other way.
FO300012615	MS12IntroToGhoul1
FO300012616	You're exactly the kind of man we need around here!
FO300012617	Chief Gustavo and his pack of goons aren't doing their job. Those Ghouls keep coming back! Somebody's bound to get hurt sooner or later.
FO300012618	I'm no stranger to violence, if that's what you're getting at.
FO300012619	Now you're talking. I've met a couple tough broads like you before. You might be just what we need around here.
FO300012620	Chief Gustavo and his pack of goons aren't doing their job. Those Ghouls keep coming back! Somebody's bound to get hurt sooner or later.
FO300012621	I'm no stranger to violence, if that's what you're getting at.
FO300012622	I bet you could. Talk to Gustavo. He could use someone like you. You could kill those Ghouls in the tunnels. Get rid of them once and for all!
FO300012623	I could kill a Ghoul or two, if I had to.
FO300012624	That's rather extreme, though near enough to the truth. Talk to Gustavo. He might be able to use you in the fight against the Ghouls.
FO300012625	The only thing a Ghoul should have to prove is how fast it can die.
FO300012626	Really? Fantastic! You can give that Gustavo a lesson or two!
FO300012627	You could say I'm an expert when it comes to dealing with Ghouls.
FO300012628	Oh my. It sounds like you might be just the person we need to take care of the situation. Talk to Gustavo.
FO300012629	I eat Ghouls for breakfast.
FO300012630	That doesn't surprise me. You should talk to Gustavo. He might be able to use someone like you.
FO300012631	I'm not afraid of Ghouls.
FO300012632	I shoot Ghouls first, and ask questions later.
FO300012633	The only good place for a Ghoul is at the end of a rope.
FO300012634	That's wonderful, comrade! Truly wonderful! Before you go Ghoul hunting, talk to Gustavo. He might be able to help you.
FO300012635	It will take more than a committee to deal with the problem. I think I can help.
FO300012636	That's terrific! A real man of action. That's just what we need!
FO300012637	I could take a whole pack of Ghouls without breaking a sweat.
FO300012638	Well. Then you know that some Ghouls aren't feral, and can be reasoned with.
FO300012639	Sure, I know lots of Ghouls. Killed my share, too.
FO300012640	MS12Greeting3
FO300012641	The strong silent type, eh? We're in luck! Ever met a Ghoul before?
FO300012642	<Say nothing.>
FO300012643	Can't find your tongue? Maybe one of those Ghouls got it. Didn't your mother tell you never to kiss a Ghoul?
FO300012644	Seriously though. You better watch out. There's a pack of those vermin hiding in some tunnels nearby. You afraid of Ghoulies, little girl?
FO300012645	<Say nothing.>
FO300012646	Not very lively are you? Perhaps you're just bored. You should go on an adventure. Nothing like a little bit of the unknown to motivate a person.
FO300012647	<Say nothing.>
FO300012648	Someone needs to talk to Tenpenny. I don't think security should let people like you just wander in like that.
FO300012649	We all need to be more vigilant with those Ghouls on the loose. Don't suppose you ran into any on your way in here, did you? Hmm?
FO300012650	<Say nothing.>
FO300012651	Not very bright, are you? Don't worry, comrade. Even the least of us have some small though important role to play in the community.
FO300012652	For example, I've appointed a committee to discuss this problem with the Ghouls trying to get in here. You know anything about Ghouls?
FO300012653	What?
FO300012654	I'm glad to meet someone who doesn't want to talk my ear off. We should get a drink together. I hate when people talk while I'm drinking. Don't you?
FO300012655	And there's plenty to drink about, er talk about, isn't there? Everyone's always prattling on about the Ghouls this, and the Ghouls that.
FO300012656	<Say nothing.>
FO300012657	Just as I thought. The end of the world happens, and everyone forgets their manners. I bet you were raised in one of those Vault things. Agh!
FO300012658	Or worse, raised by a pack of disgusting Ghouls!
FO300012659	You know much about Ghouls?
FO300012660	Sure. Whatever.
FO300012661	Is there something you want? If not, I'm busy telling my neighbors to ignore my husband and his silly committee to discuss the Ghoul situation.
FO300012662	You ever have to deal with Ghouls before?
FO300012663	Whatever.
FO300012664	Your loss. You fancy yourself a man of action? Think you're man enough to handle a couple of Ghouls?
FO300012665	I'm a little busy at the moment. Maybe we can chat later.
FO300012666	Are you calling me ugly? Nice try. I got a pile of bottlecaps that say otherwise.
FO300012667	I bet you think you're pretty butch, eh? Think you got what it takes to kill a few Ghouls?
FO300012668	From my perspective, things can't get much uglier than they already are.
FO300012669	There's no need to get snippy with me, boy!
FO300012670	We're all little perturbed on account of those Ghouls. Don't suppose you know anything about Ghouls, do you?
FO300012671	I jumped over the walls when no one was looking. How do you think I got in here?
FO300012672	There's no need to get snippy with me, girl!
FO300012673	We're all little perturbed because of those Ghouls. Don't suppose you know anything about Ghouls, do you?
FO300012674	I jumped over the walls when no one was looking. How do you think I got in here?
FO300012675	Got a fire up your butt, eh? Better put that to good use. Go out exploring. Don't hang around these fools. You'll only want to blow your brains out.
FO300012676	Shouldn't you be napping or something?
FO300012677	Ah, but not everyone has common sense. Do they?
FO300012678	True happiness flows from respecting those in charge, because they have the happiness of the people at heart.
FO300012679	For example, I've appointed a committee to discuss this problem with the Ghouls trying to get in here. You know anything about Ghouls?
FO300012680	People don't need leaders, just good common sense.
FO300012681	Well, then you'll excuse me if I don't invite you to share a drink?
FO300012682	I'm your worst nightmare.
FO300012683	Tsk. Tsk. You were raised by beasts weren't you? Poor thing.
FO300012684	Did those Ghouls send you here to torment us civilized folk?
FO300012685	Seriously though, they have everyone on edge. So mind your manners!
FO300012686	Oh look, another stuck-up bitch. How impressive.
FO300012687	Ha! You try being married to my husband for five minutes. I dare you!
FO300012688	Did you happen to see any Ghouls out there in the Wasteland? You know how to kill one?
FO300012689	Isn't a wife supposed to honor and obey her husband?
FO300012690	Me too. Especially rich fine young men!
FO300012691	Listen, you look like you can handle yourself. You survived out there in the Wasteland getting here, after all. You ever have to deal with Ghouls?
FO300012692	You bet! I like meeting new people.
FO300012693	You got a lot of nerve talking to me like that! But I can respect a woman who doesn't put up with crap.
FO300012694	Think you're tough enough to take on a couple of Ghouls?
FO300012695	I'm not lost. I'm not a little girl. And I'm not that bad. We could be friends.
FO300012696	Gustavo says he has the situation well in order, but I wonder if he's really trying. Don't suppose you ran into any Ghouls on your way in here?
FO300012697	Don't worry. I was let in at the front gate.
FO300012698	"Daring?" Bet you had to earn that nickname, huh?
FO300012699	Thanks, comrade. I'm sure you'll agree the people are only as strong as their leader. That's why I do my best to serve the community to the fullest.
FO300012700	I've formed a committee to investigate the problem.
FO300012701	It's nice to meet someone with a sense of civic duty.
FO300012702	Oh, fine. We'll have to share a drink sometime. I'm always in the Federalist Lounge. There's certainly plenty to drink about.
FO300012703	Don't suppose you know anything about dealing with their kind, do you?
FO300012704	I'm nobody in particular. But I'm sure you'll soon come to like me.
FO300012705	You're better mannered than your apparent breeding would indicate. It is nice to make your acquaintance.
FO300012706	You didn't happen to catch a glimpse of any Ghouls on your way here did you?
FO300012707	It's very nice to meet you, my Lady Wellington.
FO300012708	Do you know he tried forming a committee to discuss the Ghoul situation? A committee! He made himself Chairman, of course.
FO300012709	What we need is somebody to DO something! Not just talk about it.
FO300012710	Don't suppose you know anything about Ghouls, do you?
FO300012711	You put up with a lot from your husband, huh?
FO300012712	I'll just be going now.
FO300012713	Damn right you will. Get lost.
FO300012714	Let me think about that option.
FO300012715	Very well, but don't think too long. We don't have much time. My spies say their tall ships are sailing into our harbors even as we speak.
FO300012716	I'll try and get the ink for you.
FO300012717	Excellent! Please hasten back. There's no telling how much longer we can hold here at the fort.
FO300012718	I hear the thumping of their cannonade getting closer by the minute. Soon, our walls will be breached and the last bastion of the U.S.A. may fall!
FO300012719	How can we create a convincing forgery?
FO300012720	If you were to bring me some iron gall ink, I could produce a mirror perfect duplication.
FO300012721	The best place to find some would be in the Arlington Library, which is why I have been unable to do this myself.
FO300012722	After all, I can't abandon these fortifications.
FO300012723	Sure, whatever.
FO300012724	I'm surprised you're not reveling in the moment. This is a great day for the United States of America.
FO300012725	I think you said it best when you said: "We in America do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate."
FO300012726	It has been both an honor and a privilege to serve the United States.
FO300012727	What are your final orders?
FO300012728	Stand down, and honorably relinquish your post. You've earned a rest.
FO300012729	Coming from you, that means all the world to me. It's been an honor and a privilege to serve my country.
FO300012730	It's time for me to take a long-needed rest. I think you'll find that the rest of my men are long-due for the same.
FO300012731	I hereby relinquish command and control of this fortification to you.
FO300012732	Yes, Button. We won!
FO300012733	It's over? Amen to that. Then I suppose my posting here at the fort is complete.
FO300012734	I think you said it best when you said: "We in America do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate."
FO300012735	It has been both an honor and a privilege to serve in the army of the United States.
FO300012736	What are your final orders?
FO300012737	It will be brought to the State House for safe keeping.
FO300012738	The State House still stands? Then the Stars and Stripes truly are forever. All hail the red, white and blue!
FO300012739	It will be carried to our new President, Abraham Washington.
FO300012740	A new president? So, the Stars and Stripes truly are forever. All hail the red, white and blue!
FO300012741	A new president? So, the Stars and Stripes truly are forever. All hail the red, white and blue!
FO300012742	It will be carried to our new President, ummm, Lincoln Madison.
FO300012743	Let me prove my honesty by helping you trick the Redcoats.
FO300012744	Interesting. I had a plan for just this sort of situation. Perhaps this will prove that you're here as an ally rather than an enemy.
FO300012745	We create a forgery of the Declaration and send it off to Great Britain! It might be just the delay we need to get the document out of here safely.
FO300012746	I'd love to be at court when King George finds out he wasted all his resources gaining a forgery!
FO300012747	We have to be cautious though, the British scholars would recognize a poor duplicate almost immediately.
FO300012748	I'm Thomas Jefferson and I've returned to liberate the Declaration.
FO300012749	Saints alive! It is both an honor and a privilege, sir. I was hoping this day would arrive.
FO300012750	I hope these fortifications are up to your high standards, sir. All of my men await your command to push and retake the Capital!
FO300012751	May I ask where you intend to bring the document?
FO300012752	I'm sorry, I'm out of meds. Hang in there.
FO300012753	Thanks, I'll try and keep it together.
FO300012754	I'll try.
FO300012755	Here, take one of these Stimpaks. It should help.
FO300012756	Thanks, I'll use it right away.
FO300012757	Well, ummm. This is quite embarrassing actually.
FO300012758	I sent someone like yourself after the Declaration. She did some of the research for me, but now I haven't seen her in a few months.
FO300012759	I wouldn't worry about it. Many have died for causes far less grand than what you're about to undertake.
FO300012760	Oh, shouldn't be too long. I just need to get things set up for you. Just sit tight, and I'll be with you as soon as I can.
FO300012761	Yes, I think I'd like that. Will it take long?
FO300012762	That's still bothering you? Hmm. Well, I can run a few more tests if you like.
FO300012763	I've got this headache that just won't go away. Even with the pills you gave me last week. It's the lights, I think. They hurt my eyes.
FO300012764	Hi, Stanley. Sorry to keep you waiting; what seems to be the trouble today?
FO300012765	I'm an agent of Thomas Jefferson and I've returned to liberate the Declaration.
FO300012766	Saints alive! It is both an honor and a privilege, madam. I knew the day would arrive that Jefferson would send someone to help!
FO300012767	I hope these fortifications are up to your high standards, madam. All of my men await your command to push and retake the Capital!
FO300012768	May I ask where you intend to bring the document?
FO300012769	You recovered all of that stuff in the Preservation Society's museum?
FO300012770	Oh no. There is more than a lifetime's supply of grade A crap in that place. Couldn't possibly do it alone. Like you, he hires anyone off the street.
FO300012771	Honestly, I don't care what he does with that stuff. As long as the caps keep flowing, I'll be there to collect.
FO300012772	Oh no. There is more than a lifetime's supply of grade A crap in his museum. Couldn't possibly do it alone. Like you, he hires anyone off the street.
FO300012773	Honestly, I don't care what he does with that stuff. As long as the caps keep flowing, I'll be there to collect.
FO300012774	Have you recovered a lot of relics for Abraham Washington?
FO300012775	Since we're partners now, why don't you tell me about yourself?
FO300012776	Ha, I'm surprised that you care. Usually everyone looks out for themselves nowadays.
FO300012777	What is it you wanna know?
FO300012778	I need to leave. Can you open the gate?
FO300012779	Follow me.
FO300012780	Sure.
FO300012781	Alright. One moment.
FO300012782	Yes sir.
FO300012783	Yes ma'am.
FO300012784	What kind of place is this Rivet City?
FO300012785	Rivet City is one of the few bastions of civilization left in the land. We're working to rebuild our society; to make the world livable again.
FO300012786	We're the safest, most secure city in the Wasteland. Nothing can get in here without our say so.
FO300012787	Why did all you decide to live on this rusty old tub?
FO300012788	It's a boat. A really big boat.
FO300012789	Do you know anything about Rivet City? How they made it? Anything?
FO300012790	It's a place to live, safe from Raiders and Super Mutants.
FO300012791	With Doctor Li on our side, maybe we can even begin to rebuild the world.
FO300012792	Why are you guys living on this boat?
FO300012793	It's noisy, dark, and smelly.
FO300012794	But we're safe here. No Super Mutants or Raiders. And maybe Doctor Li will find a way to get clean water for us.
FO300012795	What's it like living on a giant ship?
FO300012796	I heard that Rivet City is run by some sort of Council?
FO300012797	Chief Harkness meets with Doctor Li and Bannon to discuss security matters.
FO300012798	It's a waste of a good Monday morning if you ask me. They should just let Chief Harkness call the shots.
FO300012799	Chief Danvers meets with Doctor Li and Bannon to discuss how to run this tub.
FO300012800	It's a waste of a good Monday morning if you ask me. They should just let Chief Harkness call the shots.
FO300012801	Doctor Li, Chief Harkness and I are all on the council. We meet every Monday morning.
FO300012802	I can be very influential, if you know what I mean. Far more than Seagrave Holmes.
FO300012803	So you're on the City Council.
FO300012804	Doctor Li, Chief Harkness and I are all on the council. We meet every Monday morning.
FO300012805	I can be very influential, if you know what I mean.
FO300012806	So you're on the City Council.
FO300012807	Doctor Li, Chief Danvers and I are all on the council. We meet every Monday morning.
FO300012808	I can be very influential, if you know what I mean. Far more than Seagrave Holmes.
FO300012809	So you're on the City Council.
FO300012810	Doctor Li, Chief Danvers and I are all on the council. We meet every Monday morning.
FO300012811	I can be very influential, if you know what I mean.
FO300012812	So you're on the City Council.
FO300012813	Bannon and Doctor Li and I all meet on Monday mornings to talk about city wide issues.
FO300012814	It's pretty informal. The council doesn't have much real power.
FO300012815	I heard you're on some sort of City Council.
FO300012816	I heard Angela Staley has a crush on Diego.
FO300012817	Oh, yes. She's crazy about him.
FO300012818	He keeps telling her no, but he also spends a lot of time with her. It's really not fair to her.
FO300012819	Haven't you heard? They're going to get married!
FO300012820	It's so wonderful. We haven't had a wedding in years.
FO300012821	How are things between Diego and Angela these days?
FO300012822	That poor girl. Diego told her to never bother him again. She was devastated.
FO300012823	What ever happened between Diego and Angela?
FO300012824	Yeah, I know. Thank God he's a priest. At least I know nothing's going on between them.
FO300012825	Father Clifford would kick him out of the priesthood if he ever found out.
FO300012826	I heard your daughter has a crush on Diego.
FO300012827	Mooning over him? Not any more. She's going to marry him! I'm so happy for my little girl.
FO300012828	Is Angela still mooning over Diego?
FO300012829	Father Clifford caught the two of them rutting like Brahmin.
FO300012830	Thank God Diego has enough good sense to make an honest woman of her.
FO300012831	Is Angela still mooning over Diego?
FO300012832	Mooning over him? You have old news, my friend. She married him! They are such a happy couple.
FO300012833	Is Angela still mooning over Diego?
FO300012834	That coward! He told her to stay away from him. She still cries about it at night. It's a good thing I would never hurt a priest.
FO300012835	I haven't seen Angela bothering Diego lately.
FO300012836	Well, one of us is. Sometimes it seems like he doesn't even know I'm there.
FO300012837	So, you and Diego are in love?
FO300012838	Oh, my God! It was so romantic.
FO300012839	Diego has left the Church. We're going to get married!
FO300012840	Did the Ant Pheromone work?
FO300012841	Father Clifford expelled Diego. So now we can get married!
FO300012842	So how are things with Diego lately?
FO300012843	It's true! I'm so happy. Diego is a wonderful man.
FO300012844	So, you and Diego are in love?
FO300012845	That rat bastard! I hate his guts.
FO300012846	He told me to leave him alone. He won't even talk to me about.
FO300012847	So, you and Diego are in love?
FO300012848	Nevermind. It doesn't matter what Angela thinks. Soon I will take vows of chastity.
FO300012849	I hear Angela Staley has a crush on you.
FO300012850	But I am an honorable man. I will make her an honorable woman. We're going to get married.
FO300012851	I thought I would be more upset about leaving the church, but she makes me so happy.
FO300012852	How are things between you and Angela?
FO300012853	Father Clifford accused me of having relations with Angela. He wouldn't listen when I told him it was a lie.
FO300012854	I am no longer an acolyte. I've been expelled.
FO300012855	Sometimes when God shuts one door though, he opens another.
FO300012856	I've asked Angela to marry me, and she said yes.
FO300012857	How are things between you and Angela?
FO300012858	Oh, yes! I had to give up being a priest, but it was worth it.
FO300012859	So, you and Angela are married?
FO300012860	That is a thing of the past. I told her to stay away from me forever.
FO300012861	Did you talk to Angela? Are you still seeing her?
FO300012862	What! If that's true, I'll defrock him. Not only is he fornicating, but he's doing with such an innocent, young girl.
FO300012863	I heard that Diego and Angela are sleeping together. <Lie.>
FO300012864	You mean that he's left the priesthood? Yes.
FO300012865	They are going to get married. Well, at least I get to perform the ceremony.
FO300012866	Is what I heard about Diego true?
FO300012867	I was forced to expel him from the priesthood. It's a shame really. He would have made a fine priest.
FO300012868	And Diego has done the right thing by asking her to marry him. Thank God for that.
FO300012869	Is what I heard about Diego true?
FO300012870	Yes, I did. It was a beautiful ceremony.
FO300012871	Unfortunately, I am now short one acolyte. But this was God's will. I'm sure it's for the better.
FO300012872	You married Diego and Angela?
FO300012873	The poor dear. I wish there was something I could do to help her.
FO300012874	That boy ought to just give her a tumble. It would be good for both of them.
FO300012875	Disgusting, isn't it? Someone should talk to that boy. He has no business hanging around that tramp if he's going to be a priest.
FO300012876	Who is this Saint Monica?
FO300012877	She is the patron saint of lost children. Very popular among the faithful of Rivet City. I'm surprised you've never heard of her.
FO300012878	If you want to hear her story, it will be the topic of my sermon on Sunday. Services begin at 8 am. You should come.
FO300012879	Saint Monica saved her own son's soul from eternal damnation.
FO300012880	She is now the patron saint of lost children for the faithful everywhere.
FO300012881	You really should come to church on Sunday mornings. The sermon will be all about Saint Monica.
FO300012882	What is the Capital Preservation Society?
FO300012883	It's some sort of museum that nutjob Abraham Washington runs.
FO300012884	I'm sorry, but we had a deal for 100 caps.
FO300012885	Oh, no no no. I offered a deal for 100 caps. You declined. So now I'm offering a new deal for 300 caps.
FO300012886	But why worry about trivialities when your father's safety could be at stake?
FO300012887	300? What the hell? You said it was 100 caps!
FO300012888	I did say it was 100 caps. And as I recall, you said no. So now I'm saying it's 300 caps. What will you say this time?
FO300012889	MegCromwellPrayEvening
FO300012890	Behold! He is coming with the clouds! And every eye shall be blind with his glory! Every ear shall be stricken deaf to hear the thunder of his voice!
FO300012891	Let the men, women, and children of the Earth come forth to gather and behold the power of Atom!
FO300012892	Let those who dwell here in his favored land attend now to the words of the Prophet of Atom!
FO300012893	Come forth and drink the waters of the Glow, for this ancient weapon of war is our salvation, it is the very symbol of Atom's glory!
FO300012894	Let it serve as a reminder of the Division that has occurred in the past and the resplendence of the promise of our division in the times to come!
FO300012895	Give your bodies to Atom, my friends. Release yourself to his power, feel his Glow, and be Divided.
FO300012896	There shall be no tears, no sorrow, no suffering, for in the Division, we shall see our release from the pain and hardships of this world.
FO300012897	Yea, your suffering shall exist no longer; it shall be washed away in Atom's Glow, burned from you in the fire of his brilliance.
FO300012898	Each of us shall give birth to a billion stars formed from the mass of our wretched and filthy bodies.
FO300012899	Each of us shall be mother and father to a trillion civilizations.
FO300012900	Each of us shall know peace, shall know an end to pain, and shall know Atom in his glory.
FO300012901	Glorious Atom, I give unto you these feeble bones. I present to your will this frail body.
FO300012902	I beg of you to use me as your vessel, guide me to your brilliance, divide each particle and give relief to this rotten flesh.
FO300012903	Cast the fragile form of this ephemeral body into new life in the forge of your Glow.
FO300012904	Yeah. Where'd that Behemoth come from? Good thing Lyons' little friend turned out to be so handy with a Fat Man.
FO300012905	Yeah. Where'd that Behemoth come from?
FO300012906	Civilians with nukes. Scary stuff. Anyway, a win's a win, right?
FO300012907	No idea. Now he's going to be stinking up the place for weeks. Oh well, a win's a win, right?
FO300012908	Well, I've looked around a bit.
FO300012909	Oh? And have you come to any conclusions?
FO300012910	This place is a dump.
FO300012911	Sigh. I was hoping seeing these pieces of the past would snap you out of your pessimism. I see I was wrong.
FO300012912	I found it quite entertaining.
FO300012913	It makes me so happy to hear that! Feel free to look around all you like.
FO300012914	Whatever, old timer.
FO300012915	Bah! Sometimes I feel like it's hopeless.
FO300012916	I wish I knew more about America.
FO300012917	Looks like a bunch of junk to me.
FO300012918	That's just the attitude I have come to expect from uneducated individuals.
FO300012919	It's people like you who will cause the name America to fade from memory. Children will think of the U.S.A. as just the Wasteland.
FO300012920	I mustn't let that happen! That's why this place exists.
FO300012921	I suppose I see your point.
FO300012922	Then we understand each other. Hundreds of years ago, people studied history as a career. Then, when the bombs fell, it was almost lost.
FO300012923	Can you imagine a country like the U.S.A. without it? It would be the same empty feeling as not knowing your birth mother.
FO300012924	We are children of this country and to respect it is to know about it.
FO300012925	So, you really care about these relics?
FO300012926	Why, of course I do!
FO300012927	If these items were lost to time, how would we ever be able to explore our heritage or appreciate the sacrifices our founding fathers made?
FO300012928	Oh my! I never expected anyone to find this! I didn't even know it was still intact!
FO300012929	Well, certainly a reward is in order for your efforts. How about 100 caps?
FO300012930	I've recovered a copy of the Magna Carta. Interested?
FO300012931	Indeed I am. Although there were several copies made of the document, I certainly never expected to come across one intact.
FO300012932	What do you say to 75 caps for it?
FO300012933	What are you up to?
FO300012934	Well, now that we brought back the Declaration, I think I'll take my cut of the earnings and head out to get drunk.
FO300012935	Look me up in Underworld if you ever need me. I usually hang there since the Ghouls don't hit on me all the time.
FO300012936	How's the museum business?
FO300012937	Oh, it treats me well. I'm sure it will be even better now that we have the Declaration of Independence.
FO300012938	Hopefully, we can add more to the collection and increase our foot traffic!
FO300012939	I don't have 300 caps.
FO300012940	Well, that's a shame for you, isn't it? You don't have the caps, and I guess I don't have the information. Disappointment all around.
FO300012941	Fine, 300 caps. Now spill it.
FO300012942	Nothing like the sound of caps jingling in your pocket is there? Always brightens my day.
FO300012943	And to brighten your day, here's what I know. Your dad said he was headed southeast, into the city. He was aiming for Galaxy News Radio.
FO300012944	No idea what he wants with them, but you can ask him all about it when you find him. Good luck with that, by the way.
FO300012945	Oh, come on now. Are people in your Vault so gullible that you think I'd fall for this?
FO300012946	You don't have the caps, so you don't get the information. I'm not stupid.
FO300012947	Okay, let's just take a step back. 100 caps was reasonable, wasn't it?
FO300012948	Well, I suppose it was. All right; because I'm such a softy, I'll honor our original agreement.
FO300012949	Your dad came through here, all right. Didn't stay long, though. Said he had some important business to attend to, and headed off to the city.
FO300012950	Something to do with Galaxy News Radio. Guess that'd be the place for you to start. Good hunting, and thanks for the caps.
FO300012951	I'm reasonable, but I'm not crazy. How can you bargain with me and not have the caps?
FO300012952	This is ridiculous. Forget it.
FO300012953	Didn't you say that last time, too? I have a feeling you'll be coming back again.
FO300012954	MegDocChurchMedicalChatter
FO300012955	Now how did THAT get in there?
FO300012956	I swear you people never learn, what do you think is out there in that Wasteland anyway?
FO300012957	Here, hold this end for me. Okay, now give it back.
FO300012958	You alright up there. Need another painkiller?
FO300012959	You weren't kidding. You love the smack, all right.
FO300012960	I'm taking food out of the mouths of some poor dealer's kids right now, you know.
FO300012961	That burning sensation you feel, all over your body? That's my patented Addiction-Be-Gone treatment at work!
FO300012962	All right, here's your money.
FO300012963	Alright, hold still.
FO300012964	Then what the hell are you wasting my time for?
FO300012965	Actually, I don't have 100 caps.
FO300012966	Alright, hold still.
FO300012967	You kiddin' me? What are you wasting my time for?
FO300012968	Actually, I don't have 100 caps.
FO300012969	Alright, hold still.
FO300012970	You kiddin' me? What are you wasting my time for?
FO300012971	Actually, I don't have 100 caps.
FO300012972	Okay, now hold still.
FO300012973	Sure, fine.
FO300012974	Stop squirming, you big mungo.
FO300012975	Sure, fine.
FO300012976	Hey! If you don't have the caps, you don't get the fix.
FO300012977	Actually, I don't have 100 caps.
FO300012978	I'd like to help, but the supplies aren't free. Sorry.
FO300012979	Actually, I don't have the caps.
FO300012980	All right, here's your money.
FO300012981	Alright, hold still.
FO300012982	Then what the hell are you wasting my time for?
FO300012983	Actually, I don't have 75 caps.
FO300012984	Here. Hold this for me while I stitch you up.
FO300012985	You kiddin' me? What are you wasting my time for?
FO300012986	Actually, I don't have 75 caps.
FO300012987	How unfortunate for you.
FO300012988	Actually, I don't have 75 caps.
FO300012989	Hold on, this is going to ouch a bit.
FO300012990	Sure, fine.
FO300012991	Okay, get ready. This'll sting. A lot.
FO300012992	Sure, fine.
FO300012993	Hey! If you don't have the caps, you don't get the fix.
FO300012994	Sure, fine.
FO300012995	I'd like to help, but the supplies aren't free. Sorry.
FO300012996	Actually, I don't have the caps.
FO300012997	That's all I need.
FO300012998	Alright. Come back anytime you have the caps to pay.
FO300012999	Alright then.
FO300013000	Okay then. Try not to get killed out there.
FO300013001	Okay then. Try not to get killed out there.
FO300013002	Acknowledged.
FO300013003	Make it quick.
FO300013004	Well, speak up then. I don't have all day.
FO300013005	Let's get on with it then.
FO300013006	Let's get on with it then.
FO300013007	Acknowledged.
FO300013008	On second thought, I'll be fine.
FO300013009	Then why are you bothering me?
FO300013010	Then stop wasting my time.
FO300013011	Then stop wasting my time.
FO300013012	Fine. Less of my supplies you're using up.
FO300013013	At those prices, I'll take care of myself.
FO300013014	All right, here's your money.
FO300013015	Alright, hold still.
FO300013016	Then what the hell are you wasting my time for?
FO300013017	Actually, I don't have 50 caps.
FO300013018	Alright, now stand still. This'll only take a second.
FO300013019	Here, bite down on this. It'll help with the pain.
FO300013020	You kiddin' me? What are you wasting my time for?
FO300013021	Actually, I don't have 50 caps.
FO300013022	Here, bite down on this. It'll help with the pain.
FO300013023	How unfortunate for you.
FO300013024	Actually, I don't have 50 caps.
FO300013025	This is going to hurt, so you'd better not start crying.
FO300013026	Sure, fine.
FO300013027	You may want to look away. I don't want you throwing up, on top of all this.
FO300013028	Sure, fine.
FO300013029	Hey! If you don't have the caps, you don't get the fix.
FO300013030	Actually, I don't have 50 caps.
FO300013031	You should come back and see me when you have enough money for the supplies.
FO300013032	Actually, I don't have the caps.
FO300013033	You too, missy. Time for the G.O.A.T. Find a seat and wait for instructions.
FO300013034	You too, mister. Time for the G.O.A.T. Find a seat and wait for instructions.
FO300013035	If you're the acolyte, who's the priest?
FO300013036	Father Clifford. The sanctuary is in the ship's fore, on the upper deck. The good father holds services every Sunday morning.
FO300013037	There's a church in Rivet City?
FO300013038	Oh, yes! Father Clifford conducts services every Sunday morning. You should come.
FO300013039	Oh, yes! I conduct services every Sunday morning. You should come.
FO300013040	Do you actually do anything here in Rivet City?
FO300013041	You mean, like fix stuff? Nah.
FO300013042	I just hang out, dude. I've got enough chems to last a while. Oh, yeah!
FO300013043	You seem pretty relaxed.
FO300013044	No point in getting all worked up. I get three squares, I got a place to crash, and nothings trying to eat me.
FO300013045	So, you report to Chief Harkness?
FO300013046	I'm his second in command. I run the night shift and he runs the day shift.
FO300013047	Is this conversation going somewhere? Because I've got things to do.
FO300013048	He's gone. I'm in charge now.
FO300013049	Did you want something, or are you just wasting my time?
FO300013050	What happened to Chief Harkness?
FO300013051	Whoa! I just wanted to ask you something.
FO300013052	Yeah, well I don't have time for newbies like you. You got something on your mind, spill it.
FO300013053	No, sir. I'm just here to drink and talk.
FO300013054	Let's keep it that way.
FO300013055	Belle can mix almost anything, as long as its beer or whiskey.
FO300013056	That depends. What makes a troublemaker?
FO300013057	Starting fights, breaking stuff, stealing. Hmmm. I think I'll keep a close eye on you.
FO300013058	Who's in charge around here?
FO300013059	It doesn't work like that. I'm in charge of security. Doctor Li runs most of everything else.
FO300013060	Bannon kind of represents the merchants. He also owns Potomac Attire.
FO300013061	Depends. Chief Harkness is in charge of security. He patrols the whole city. Security bunks down in the tower.
FO300013062	Doctor Li kind of runs everything else. She's in the aft. That's the northeast end of the city.
FO300013063	It doesn't work like that. We're just security. Doctor Li runs most of everything else.
FO300013064	Bannon kind of represents the merchants. He also owns Potomac Attire.
FO300013065	Where can I get medical help?
FO300013066	Doctor Preston is in the upper deck, fore section. That's the top interior floor in the southwest end.
FO300013067	Where are the stores?
FO300013068	Hangar deck. Right in the middle of the ship. Can't miss it.
FO300013069	Hangar deck. Right in the middle of the ship. Can't miss it.
FO300013070	But it's closed now. Check back in the morning. It opens pretty early.
FO300013071	I'm kind of lost. Can you help me?
FO300013072	I suppose.
FO300013073	Here. Have some Psycho.
FO300013074	Thanks, man. I really need this fix.
FO300013075	You shouldn't take that stuff. It'll kill you.
FO300013076	That's what Cindy says too. But I got the itch. I need it bad.
FO300013077	Why don't you just take them from your shop?
FO300013078	My wife, Cindy. She's always watching the inventory. If I take any, she'll lock me out.
FO300013079	I think Mister Lopez is suicidal.
FO300013080	Yes, I know. I've been counseling him for some time now.
FO300013081	He used to go stand on the observation balcony all afternoon. He's down to only a hour or so at three o'clock.
FO300013082	You seem depressed.
FO300013083	Is it that obvious? I suppose so.
FO300013084	My family was killed by Raiders. I don't have much to live for any more.
FO300013085	Why wouldn't I remember you?
FO300013086	Nobody does. I'm not very memorable.
FO300013087	Don't worry, it won't be a problem for much longer.
FO300013088	What is this place?
FO300013089	This is the Weatherly Hotel. It's the finest establishment in Rivet City.
FO300013090	Who's your owner, rust bucket?
FO300013091	I serve Miss Vera Weatherly, proprietor of the Weatherly Hotel.
FO300013092	Did you know that Mei Wong is a runaway slave?
FO300013093	No. Interesting.
FO300013094	Never look a gift slave in the mouth, I say.
FO300013095	Yes. I'm one of them. Have been for years. <lie>
FO300013096	No! Don't take me back! I would rather die than be a slave for that awful Allistair Tenpenny.
FO300013097	I'm not going to hurt you. What are you so scared of?
FO300013098	I suppose it doesn't matter if I tell you.
FO300013099	I used to be a slave. I saw a Slaver on this ship, his name is Sister. I'm afraid he's after me.
FO300013100	I suppose nothing, now. I've been hunted for so long, being safe here in Rivet City is strange. Sorry.
FO300013101	You don't need to be scared, son.
FO300013102	I ain't scared, and I ain't your son.
FO300013103	Any other stupid questions, asshole?
FO300013104	So, where's your family?
FO300013105	My mom is probably drunk, and my dad's dead.
FO300013106	Is that good enough for you, asshole?
FO300013107	Dead. Some asshole like you killed them.
FO300013108	You're a priest?
FO300013109	Yes. My flock is all of Rivet City. You should come to services this Sunday. I'll be telling the tale of Saint Monica.
FO300013110	You're a runaway. I had to tell Sister about you.
FO300013111	Oh, my God! What am I going to do now? How could you?
FO300013112	Get away from me!
FO300013113	You're on your own. I'm not getting involved.
FO300013114	I suppose it was wrong of me to ask you for help. I won't talk to you about this again.
FO300013115	Here's 25 caps. Maybe you can buy yourself a gun.
FO300013116	Thank you! I'll go to Flak and Shrapnel's just before closing.
FO300013117	I don't have anything to give you, but I think I can trust you with a secret.
FO300013118	If you ever go up north, there is a secret slave hide out called Temple of the Union. You might find them useful.
FO300013119	Thank you! I'll go to Flak and Shrapnel's just before closing.
FO300013120	I guess that was too much to ask for. Farewell.
FO300013121	I'd give you enough caps to buy a gun, but I'm a bit short right now.
FO300013122	Let me think about it.
FO300013123	Don't worry. I would never turn in a runaway slave.
FO300013124	Really? Oh, thank you.
FO300013125	Can you help me? I've been so worried with him around. I can hardly sleep at night.
FO300013126	No! Please, don't tell Sister. I think he's a Slaver. I don't want to be taken by him.
FO300013127	What is this I hear about the Hangar Deck and Upper Deck?
FO300013128	The Upper Deck people have more money and influence than those that live on the Hangar Deck.
FO300013129	Some of the upper deck citizens can get pretty snobby about it.
FO300013130	That's just folks blowing off steam.
FO300013131	Every place has it's haves and have nots. We got Upper Deck and Hangar Deck.
FO300013132	Don't let it bother you.
FO300013133	The people that live on the Hangar Deck are the great unwashed masses.
FO300013134	I read that somewhere. Do you like it?
FO300013135	Anyway, they need true leaders, like myself.
FO300013136	We do the best we can to take care of everyone on the Hangar Deck.
FO300013137	It's not their fault they can't do better for themselves.
FO300013138	The Hangar Deck people should know their place.
FO300013139	Leave the thinking to people who are qualified.
FO300013140	It's a sad state of affairs, but the people that live on those two decks don't trust each other.
FO300013141	The Hangar Deck folk believe the Upper Deck people are keeping them down.
FO300013142	The Upper Deck citizens believe the Hangar Deck people aren't capable of managing Rivet City.
FO300013143	It's a shame really. Everyone should just get along.
FO300013144	It's not too bad now, but if it keeps going this way, in a few years they'll start fighting in the streets.
FO300013145	Father Clifford keeps preaching about tolerance and acceptance, but nobody seems to be listening.
FO300013146	Damn Upper Deckers. They think they're better than us. Well, screw them.
FO300013147	Yeah, the folks on the Upper Deck think pretty highly of themselves. They think they're better than us.
FO300013148	Well, we do all the work, and they keep all the good stuff. Assholes, every one of them.
FO300013149	Sorry. Not interested. Get your own drinks.
FO300013150	Tightwad!
FO300013151	No! Wait, I didn't mean that. Please, mister? Just one drink.
FO300013152	Bitch!
FO300013153	These guys won't buy me a round. Just one? Please?
FO300013154	Sure. Here's 5 caps. Go ahead and pick your poison.
FO300013155	Whoa! Why is the room spinning?
FO300013156	You're nice. I can tell you a secret. I'm drunk. No, that's not the secret. I have another secret.
FO300013157	Now that's what I like in a man. Enough caps to buy a lady a drink.
FO300013158	I guess you're okay. Thanks for the drink.
FO300013159	Some kids are just born bad.
FO300013160	You got that right. My James sure is.
FO300013161	I'll be in the Muddy Rudder later. Stop by and we can have a drink together.
FO300013162	You got that right. My James sure is.
FO300013163	Sit down and buy me a drink.
FO300013164	No, I haven't seen him.
FO300013165	Figures.
FO300013166	I'm going to the Muddy Rudder for a drink later. If I see you down there, you can buy me a drink.
FO300013167	Figures.
FO300013168	You should buy me a drink now.
FO300013169	Hey, I don't want any trouble.
FO300013170	Smart move. What did you want?
FO300013171	But you're a man. Why do they call you Sister?
FO300013172	Are you making fun of my name? It's a damn good thing for you this place is crawling with security. Otherwise I'd kick your ass.
FO300013173	At ease, private. I'm here to inspect the armory.
FO300013174	Sir, you are not authorized to enter the armory. Sir!
FO300013175	Please don't make me shoot you, Sir!
FO300013176	So what's your story, slag heap?
FO300013177	Sir, this slag heap is guarding the armory. Sir!
FO300013178	Glad to see you're alive Shorty!
FO300013179	Oh Shorty! I'll tell the others you died bravely!
FO300013180	Me too! Now, let's get the hell out of here!
FO300013181	Damn it! She's dead. Damn damn damn!!! Alright, let's get the hell out of here before one of us joins her. Come on! Move it!
FO300013182	Red's fine. Let's go!
FO300013183	Alright, if you say so boss. But if we get to Big Town and she isn't there, I'll kill you.
FO300013184	Come on, let's get out of here.
FO300013185	Alright! Move it!
FO300013186	MS01RedShortyDead
FO300013187	Shorty's dead.
FO300013188	That sucks! Really? She's dead? Damnit. Let's get out of here, and maybe we can kill a few Super Mutants on the way out! Come on!
FO300013189	Red's dead.
FO300013190	Red was taken with the others in the last attack by the Super Mutants. She's the doctor. If you rescue her, I'm sure she'll give you your money.
FO300013191	Those damn Muties took her with the others when they raided the town last. If you rescue her, I'm sure she'll pay you whatever Sticky owes.
FO300013192	Red was the only decent person in this hellhole, and the Mutants took her in the raid. That Sticky is a doofus, but I bet Red will cover his debts.
FO300013193	The Super Mutants took Red along with the others. She was the only person that really ever listened to me.
FO300013194	Don't tell Sticky, though. He's liable to kill himself if he knew Red was gone.  And that would conflict with my own suicide plans.
FO300013195	Okay, fine. But just this once. Here's another collar. Be more careful this time.
FO300013196	Nah, maybe another time.
FO300013197	Alright. Whatever you say, boss; it's your loss. But you can make a pile of caps. Let me know when you change your mind.
FO300013198	Sure, I'll buy another one. Here's 100 caps.
FO300013199	Try to be more careful next time.
FO300013200	You ain't got enough caps, asshole. This ain't a soup kitchen, and those collars ain't easy to come by. Come back when you got some money.
FO300013201	Tell me how this all happened.
FO300013202	What we didn't expect was to get jumped by dozens of those damn Super Mutants. They came out of the woodwork.
FO300013203	We had to retreat into the hospital next door and fight our way to the roof like you did. It was the only direction we could manage.
FO300013204	Long story short, we got stuck on the roof with no supplies and Reilly went for help. That's the last we heard from her.
FO300013205	I'd like permission to trade.
FO300013206	<Continue to say nothing.>
FO300013207	...
FO300013208	I'm glad that we understand one another.
FO300013209	<Continue to say nothing.>
FO300013210	...
FO300013211	<Say nothing.>
FO300013212	...
FO300013213	You don't say much, do you?
FO300013214	No. I don't.
FO300013215	What do you want?
FO300013216	CitGladeTeachExplosives04
FO300013217	You're damn right you will. And you'll keep at it until you learn to keep that mouth shut. We've got no room for braggarts here.
FO300013218	Good choice. Pride has taken down more Brothers than I can count. You'd best remember that.
FO300013219	Soldier, don't you dare start running that mouth until you can put one of those grenades through a fourth story window at 200 yards.
FO300013220	Yeah, sure. That's one dead mutant. But the Brother who was using that car for cover is dead too. Learn to check your zone, maggot.
FO300013221	Did you see, sir? I nailed it. Right under the target. Boom! That's a dead mutie right there.
FO300013222	All right! That was perfect! I got it dead on! What do you think of that, sir? Good enough to take out a mutant, right?
FO300013223	Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation,
FO300013224	conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
FO300013225	Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
FO300013226	We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
FO300013227	We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
FO300013228	It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
FO300013229	But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot hallow--this ground.
FO300013230	The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.
FO300013231	The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
FO300013232	It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
FO300013233	that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--
FO300013234	that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--
FO300013235	and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
FO300013236	You have any info on where this Commonwealth android is hiding?
FO300013237	We got a man at Rivet City. Been looking for a long time. I doubt he's even still there. Either way, don't go sticking your nose in our business!
FO300013238	We got a man at Rivet City. Been looking for a long time. I doubt he's even still there. Either way, don't go sticking your nose in our business!
FO300013239	We got a man at Rivet City. Been looking for a long time. I doubt he's even still there. Either way, don't go sticking your nose in our business!
FO300013240	I found this recording from the android. Care to elaborate?
FO300013241	Trail led to Rivet City. Sister's our inside man. I think he's long given up looking for that android, and is just living it up on that boat.
FO300013242	Trail led to Rivet City. Sister's our inside man. I think he's long given up looking for that android, and is just living it up on that boat.
FO300013243	Trail led to Rivet City. Sister's our inside man. I think he's long given up looking for that android, and is just living it up on that boat.
FO300013244	I found this recording from the android. Care to elaborate?
FO300013245	Why has Zimmer hired you too? I can't find a trace of that robot. I'm sure he's here somewhere though. Don't tell Eulogy I told you, though.
FO300013246	Why has Zimmer hired you too? I can't find a trace of that robot. I'm sure he's here somewhere though. Don't tell Eulogy I told you, though.
FO300013247	Why has Zimmer hired you too? I can't find a trace of that robot. I'm sure he's here somewhere though. Don't tell Eulogy I told you, though.
FO300013248	I found this recording from the android. Care to elaborate?
FO300013249	You know anything about an android who needed some surgery?
FO300013250	All I know is Zimmer, the guy contracting to find this slave, is hot to retrieve him. He's starting to get other people looking. So it's a race now.
FO300013251	All I know is Zimmer, the guy contracting to find this slave, is hot to retrieve him. He's starting to get other people looking. So it's a race now.
FO300013252	All I know is Zimmer, the guy contracting to find this slave, is hot to retrieve him. He's starting to get other people looking. So it's a race now.
FO300013253	Despite all his grumbling, I think Eulogy still wants us finding that guy. Zimmer is asking around hiring other people. Makes us look bad.
FO300013254	I'd hunt down surgeons and bang on their heads to get leads, but I'm tired of chasing after that android thing.
FO300013255	Despite all his grumbling, I think Eulogy still wants us finding that guy. Zimmer is asking around hiring other people. Makes us look bad.
FO300013256	I'd hunt down surgeons and bang on their heads to get leads, but I'm tired of chasing after that android thing.
FO300013257	Despite all his grumbling, I think Eulogy still wants us finding that guy. Zimmer is asking around hiring other people. Makes us look bad.
FO300013258	I'd hunt down surgeons and bang on their heads to get leads, but I'm tired of chasing after that android thing.
FO300013259	I guess I can trust you not to spread it around. Zimmer has put it out that he will pay to find this slave, but he wants him alive.
FO300013260	Hey! You aren't thinking of signing up with him are you?
FO300013261	It wouldn't be healthy for you, if you know what I mean.
FO300013262	Don't know anything about a surgery, but I do know that Zimmer has put a bounty on his head.
FO300013263	A word of advice. You don't want to be competing with me for this one. I'd hate to have to waste a bullet on you.
FO300013264	I guess I can trust you not to spread it around. Zimmer has put it out that he will pay to find this slave, but he wants him alive.
FO300013265	Don't get in my way on this one. My competition tends to end up dead.
FO300013266	What do you know about an android from the Commonwealth?
FO300013267	Here's a copy of the so-called "android recording." We're done wasting resources on that job.
FO300013268	We're done wasting resources on that job.
FO300013269	Tell me more about this android.
FO300013270	Here's a copy of the so-called "android recording." I'm done wasting my time on that old job.
FO300013271	I'm done wasting my time on that old job. Forget it.
FO300013272	Tell me more about this android.
FO300013273	Here's a copy of the so-called "android recording." I'm done wasting my time on that old job. Don't tell Eulogy though. I kinda like it here.
FO300013274	I'm done wasting my time on that old job. Don't tell Eulogy though. I kinda like it here.
FO300013275	Tell me more about this android.
FO300013276	I found this info about an android from the Commonwealth. Care to elaborate?
FO300013277	What can I tell you about it, beyond it not being any of your business, you mean?
FO300013278	Nothing really. Just some run away android from the Commonwealth. Naturally they asked the Paradise Falls crew for help retrieving their property.
FO300013279	The job pays well, but so far it's been mostly a distraction. Certainly hasn't been a priority for us.
FO300013280	Nothing really. Just some runaway slave from the Commonwealth. Eulogy had us running around like morons looking for him. I'm done with that.
FO300013281	It's none of your God damn business.
FO300013282	Nothing really. Just some run away slave from the Commonwealth. Naturally they asked the Paradise Falls crew for help retrieving their property.
FO300013283	The job pays well, but so far it's been mostly a distraction. I think most have pretty much given up and forgotten about it.
FO300013284	Do you know where this android had his face or memory replaced?
FO300013285	Pinkerton at Rivet City took care of him a while back. Was a complete success. No one will recognize that robot now. I'm glad.
FO300013286	But you hush yourself about all that. The hounds are still out sniffing around.
FO300013287	I know you know where this android received his operations. Talk.
FO300013288	To Pinkerton at Rivet City. He doesn't remember his old life, and now he can't be forced to betray us.
FO300013289	The Lord will protect us, but just to be safe we've shut down the railroad. Agents of the Commonwealth are still looking for him.
FO300013290	I know you know where this android received his operations. Talk.
FO300013291	He was delivered to Pinkerton at Rivet City a long while back. It's been a complete success. No one will recognize that robot now.
FO300013292	We can all breathe easier, but we've shut down the Railroad until we are sure this has all blown over. Agents of the Commonwealth are still looking.
FO300013293	I know you know where this android received his operations. Talk.
FO300013294	Heard Pinkerton at Rivet City fixed him up good. That robot doesn't even know he's a robot. But they are still after him. So we all better lay low.
FO300013295	I know you know where this android received his operations. Talk.
FO300013296	Are you part of the Railroad? What do you know about this android?
FO300013297	A while back they were asking around for a computer genius to give our friend a new set of memories. You know, a clean slate and all that.
FO300013298	I know you're part of the Railroad. What do you know about the android?
FO300013299	He's one of God's creatures, just like you and I.
FO300013300	He wanted new memories and a new face. Sadly, I couldn't help him. He left to look for a tech, someone with pre-war skills.
FO300013301	I know you're part of the Railroad. What do you know about the android?
FO300013302	Shhh! Not so loud! Whoever brought you in should have told you to be more discreet!
FO300013303	They were looking for a tech-wizard awhile back. Someone who could give our friend a new set of memories. You know wipe them clear and replace them.
FO300013304	Not sure how that'd be accomplished. If you know anything, send word by the regular channels. Now go before someone overhears us!
FO300013305	I know you're part of the Railroad. What do you know about the android?
FO300013306	They were looking for a tech wizard a while back. Someone who could fiddle with the android's memories.
FO300013307	But you better stop poking around. Those Commonwealth hunters are still out there, tracking him down. We shut down the Railroad for safety.
FO300013308	I know you're part of the Railroad. What do you know about the android?
FO300013309	I know you know something about this android from the Commonwealth.
FO300013310	Last I heard, they were looking for a surgeon and a computer technician. But you best keep your head down, honey. Those hounds are still out there.
FO300013311	I know you know something about this android from the Commonwealth.
FO300013312	It's true. They found him a place to hide. It's not easy. The Commonwealth always sends someone looking. Someone ruthless and determined.
FO300013313	They had been searching for a surgeon and computer programmer. I hope they found them. It's too dangerous to be out in the open now.
FO300013314	He must be important if the hunter is still looking after all this time. May God guide his footsteps.
FO300013315	Be careful who you talk to. These are dangerous topics.
FO300013316	I know you know something about this android from the Commonwealth.
FO300013317	I heard they found him a place to hide. It's not easy. The Commonwealth always sends someone looking. Someone ruthless and determined.
FO300013318	They were looking for a surgeon and a computer wiz. But that's old news.
FO300013319	Lay low for a while. We've had to temporarily shut down the railroad.
FO300013320	I know you know something about this android from the Commonwealth.
FO300013321	They were looking for a surgeon and a techie to do some advanced stuff to make him seem like a different person.
FO300013322	But you better forget about all that for now. They shut down the Railroad. Those Commonwealth agents were starting to get close.
FO300013323	I know you know something about this android from the Commonwealth.
FO300013324	I'm interested in this android from the Commonwealth.
FO300013325	We don't do that anymore. Well, not until the heat dies down. The Railroad isn't operating anymore. Best forget it about it now.
FO300013326	I wouldn't betray one of God's children. Besides, we don't do that anymore. It's been too risky of late. We shut the Railroad down.
FO300013327	We don't do that anymore. Well, not until the heat dies down. For now, the Railroad is shut down.
FO300013328	Used to help them escape from the Commonwealth. Find them places to lay low. The last one was someone real important. They are still looking for him.
FO300013329	Ooh. We had to shut down the Railroad. Got too hot. You're endangering people by talking about it. Those Commonwealth hunters are deadly serious.
FO300013330	Do you know who did the memory transfer on the escaped android?
FO300013331	I sure do! No one believes me though. It was old Pinkerton. You know, the "ghost" of Rivet City. He's a genius!
FO300013332	I sure do! No one believes me though. It was old Pinkerton. You know, the "ghost" of Rivet City. He's a genius!
FO300013333	I sure do! No one believes me though. It was old Pinkerton. You know, the "ghost" of Rivet City. He's a genius!
FO300013334	Heard a rumor a while back that it was some guy named Pinkerton at Rivet City. Apparently he's got some sweet tech stashed on that boat.
FO300013335	Heard a rumor a while back that it was some guy named Pinkerton at Rivet City. Apparently he's got some sweet tech stashed on that boat.
FO300013336	Heard a rumor a while back that it was some guy named Pinkerton at Rivet City. Apparently he's got some sweet tech stashed on that boat.
FO300013337	Yep. Old Pinkerton. They say he helped found Rivet City. Must be some sort of crazy genius.
FO300013338	He kind of vanished a long time ago. I don't know where he went, but you might ask around the ship.
FO300013339	Yep. Old Pinkerton. They say he helped found Rivet City. Must be some sort of crazy genius.
FO300013340	He kind of vanished a long time ago. I don't know where he went, but you might ask around the ship.

FO300013342	He kind of vanished a long time ago. I don't know where he went, but you might ask around the ship.
FO300013343	It was old cranky Pinkerton who did it. Over at Rivet City. One day I mean to visit him and chat him up about it.
FO300013344	It was old cranky Pinkerton who did it. Over at Rivet City. One day I mean to visit him and chat him up about it.
FO300013345	It was old cranky Pinkerton who did it. Over at Rivet City. One day I mean to visit him and chat him up about it.
FO300013346	You know anything about the mind wipe on that escaped android?
FO300013347	That Commonwealth robot was real! I have proof. Listen to this!
FO300013348	Well, not sure how they'd do the mind wipe. Maybe with a giant magnet or something. But I know this for sure. That Commonwealth robot was real!
FO300013349	I found some information on a Circuit Neuralizer. Care to elaborate?
FO300013350	Some say it was all a hoax. But it's real. Here. Check out this holotape I found. That Commonwealth robot was real!
FO300013351	Some say it was all a hoax. But they're wrong. That Commonwealth robot was real!
FO300013352	Some say it was all a hoax. But they're wrong.  I've seen diagrams of that Neuralizer, it's real. And so is that android!
FO300013353	I found some info on a Circuit Neuralizer. Care to elaborate?
FO300013354	Shhh! They might be listening.
FO300013355	The Commonwealth has tried to make it out to be a hoax, but the escaped android is real I tell you!
FO300013356	Listen to this holotape. It will make you a believer too.
FO300013357	The Commonwealth has tried to make it out to be a hoax, but the escaped android is real I tell you!
FO300013358	The Commonwealth has tried to make it out to be a hoax, but the escaped android is real I tell you!
FO300013359	I found some info on a Circuit Neuralizer. Care to elaborate?
FO300013360	Most believe it's a hoax. Here's some evidence for you to consider for yourself. Take this holotape.
FO300013361	Most believe it's a hoax. There's some evidence for it being real. I'm not convinced either way.
FO300013362	Most believe it's a hoax. There's some evidence for it being real. I'm not convinced either way.
FO300013363	I found some info on a Circuit Neuralizer. Care to elaborate?
FO300013364	I used to this it was all so much bullshit. But then I got this holotape. Here, listen to it yourself.
FO300013365	I used to think it was all so much bullshit. I'm not so sure anymore. But it's ancient news. So who cares, right? Doesn't change my life none.
FO300013366	I used to think it was all so much bullshit. I'm not so sure anymore. But it's ancient news. So who cares, right? Doesn't change my life none.
FO300013367	I found some info on a Circuit Neuralizer. Care to elaborate?
FO300013368	What do you know about the android from the Commonwealth?
FO300013369	Ah maaaan. I wish it wasn't just a giant practical joke. Here's a spare copy of that old holotape. Think how cool it would be if it were true!
FO300013370	How cool it would be if it were true! It was a huge joke they pulled. They sent those to lots of people. I bet other people got tapes like that.
FO300013371	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013372	Have you heard the so called "android recording?" It sounds like an ordinary man! Here's a spare copy of that old holotape. It's a hoax for sure.
FO300013373	I guess they sent those tapes to lots of people. Especially people like me who are interested in technology. Boy, I wish androids were real, though!
FO300013374	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013375	Some dang fool was selling android recordings. I was just as big a fool for buying one.
FO300013376	Here, have mine. Nothing but a damn hoax anyway.
FO300013377	Yeah, I know. I got "DUMMY" written on my forehead. They sent those tapes to lots of people. You know, gullible and technically minded folk like me.
FO300013378	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013379	It's a hoax. Here listen to this "android recording." We analyzed it. That's clearly a human man speaking.
FO300013380	They sent tapes like that to various people who were interested in gadgets and technology. Our analyses concluded it was an ordinary man.
FO300013381	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013382	A bunch of bullshit, that's all that was. Here, take this old holotape. It's just some guy pulling a clever prank. Had lots of folk convinced though.
FO300013383	So much bullshit. Though I have to admit, it was a clever hoax. They sent tapes like that to various technically minded people. Ha! Couldn't fool me.
FO300013384	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013385	Do you know anything about an android from the Commonwealth?
FO300013386	They were talking about that a while ago. He needed some special surgery and brain hack or something. Was really cool.
FO300013387	Turns out it was just joke though. Wish it was real. How cool would a living robot be?
FO300013388	Something about facial surgery and reprogramming its memory. But that seems to have been a hoax. Haven't heard anything about it in a long time.
FO300013389	I reckon you're talking facial surgery and memory reprogramming.
FO300013390	I always liked that story best. Boy, Wastelanders sure can spin a yarn. It's been a while since I heard that one.
FO300013391	Supposedly he needed facial reconstruction and memory wipe. At first we were thrilled about the idea of androids. Turns out it was just a hoax.
FO300013392	Rumors about facial surgery and reprogramming its memory. That's ancient gossip by now. Forget about it, smoothskin.
FO300013393	You know who might have a Lipoplasticator or Micro Dermal Graftilizer?
FO300013394	I heard old Pinkerton at Rivet City had a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
FO300013395	I heard old Pinkerton at Rivet City had a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
FO300013396	Old Pinkerton over at Rivet City's rumored to have done it. Damn fool. High risk of infection and death. Though, I admit, I'm slightly jealous.
FO300013397	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
FO300013398	Probably down at Rivet City. Anything that has any use out here, they snatch up for themselves. That damn Pinkerton don't share nothin'.
FO300013399	Dammit! Why are you wasting my time? I already told you, ask Pinkteron down at Rivet City.
FO300013400	If you are lookin' to change your face, I'd try Pinkerton at Rivet City. That boy's got no sense of ethics. And you're a fool if you try it.
FO300013401	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
FO300013402	They say old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow got his hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. Amazing really.
FO300013403	They say old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow got his hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. Amazing really.
FO300013404	Pinkerton's the only surgeon crazy enough to try it. Too risky. Go to Rivet City if you want. But don't expect to come out looking better than me.
FO300013405	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
FO300013406	Try Pinkerton at Rivet City. Heard he has the goods. Hope he doesn't try to actually use them on anyone. Bet he would though. He's nuts.
FO300013407	Try Pinkerton at Rivet City. Heard he has the goods. Hope he doesn't try to actually use them on anyone. Bet he would though. He's nuts.
FO300013408	I tell these assholes to just stop looking in the mirror. But if you want to mess up your face, try Pinkerton at Rivet City. He's crazy enough.
FO300013409	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
FO300013410	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech. He might have what you're looking for.
FO300013411	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech. He might have what you're looking for.
FO300013412	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech and knows how to use it. He could probably rearrange your face for you if you wanted.
FO300013413	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
FO300013414	I heard a rumor that old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow conjured up a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
FO300013415	I heard a rumor that old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow conjured up a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
FO300013416	Pinkerton's the only surgeon crazy enough to try a facial reconstruction. I'd advise my patients against it. Due to high risk of deadly infection.
FO300013417	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
FO300013418	Rumor had it Pinkerton at Rivet City found a Lipoplasticator and Graftilizer. Good luck to any fool that let Pinkerton test them on him though.
FO300013419	Rumor had it Pinkerton at Rivet City found a Lipoplasticator and Graftilizer. Good luck to any fool that let Pinkerton test them on him though.
FO300013420	I know it's foolish to cut into the body unnecessarily. Leads to infection. Heard Pinkerton's willing to give it a try though. Try him at Rivet City.
FO300013421	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
FO300013422	Ever do any facial surgery? Maybe on someone from the Commonwealth?
FO300013423	Facial surgery's too dangerous. Plus you need some specialized prewar equipment. Hmm. That reminds me of an old hoax. Here's a copy of that holotape.
FO300013424	Need specialized equipment and and expertise. It's also prone to infection. Too dangerous.
FO300013425	That's all just a hoax. You'd need specialized equipment and expertise. It'd be prone to infection. Too dangerous. Never happened.
FO300013426	I found some info about an android. What do you know about his facial surgery?
FO300013427	Damn stupid idea. That reminds me of this old hoax. Here, take a listen to this crusty holotape and see for yourself.
FO300013428	Now, you know I hate repeating myself. Damn stupid idea.
FO300013429	Damn stupid idea if you ask me. That was all just an elaborate hoax.
FO300013430	I found some info about an android. What do you know about his facial surgery?
FO300013431	Medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity.  Hey, but that reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
FO300013432	Medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity.
FO300013433	That was all just an elaborate hoax. Besides, medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity.
FO300013434	I found some info about an android. What do you know about his facial surgery?
FO300013435	No one's got the tech to do that without risking infection.
FO300013436	It's clearly a joke. No one's got the tech to do that without risking infection.
FO300013437	I found some info about an android. What do you know about his facial surgery?
FO300013438	Oh if I got my hands on the right gear I might try it. It's dangerous though. Prone to infection. Reminds me of an old hoax. Listen to this holotape.
FO300013439	Oh if I got my hands on the right gear I might try it. It's dangerous though. Prone to infection.
FO300013440	That's an old hoax. Though if I got my hands on the right gear I might try it. It's dangerous though. Prone to infection.
FO300013441	I found some info about an android. What do you know about his facial surgery?
FO300013442	Facial surgery's way too dangerous to try. Need special equipment and expertise. Hmm. Reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
FO300013443	Facial surgery's way too dangerous to try. Need specialized equipment and expertise.
FO300013444	That was all just an elaborate hoax.
FO300013445	I found some info about an android. What do you know about his facial surgery?
FO300013446	Nah. You need specialized gear that doesn't exist anymore. And why risk infection? That reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
FO300013447	Nah. You need specialized gear that doesn't exist anymore. And why risk infection?
FO300013448	Forget that old practical joke. You need specialized gear that doesn't exist anymore. Besides, who'd want to risk infection?
FO300013449	I found some info about an android. What do you know about his facial surgery?
FO300013450	What do you know about this android from the Commonwealth?
FO300013451	Have you heard the so called "android recording?" Didn't know what to make it of myself.  Here's a spare copy of that old holotape. Take a listen.
FO300013452	It was a hoax. End of story. Those holotapes were sent to practically everyone doctor in the Wasteland. Go bother someone else.
FO300013453	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013454	Thought that hoax was long in the grave. Here take this holotape and hear it for yourself. That was just some bored prankster. Forget about it.
FO300013455	You got wax in your ears? I said it was a hoax. Practically every doctor in the Capital Wasteland got a holotape like that. Go bother someone else.
FO300013456	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013457	I've learned a thing or two about not taking things on appearances. That was an elaborate hoax. Take this holotape and give a listen. Clearly fake.
FO300013458	It was clearly faked. You can ask practically any doctor in the Wasteland. We all got a tape like this.
FO300013459	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013460	That old "android recording?" Some of the boys took that seriously. Clearly it was a hoax. Here's a copy of the holotape. Listen for yourself.
FO300013461	You don't take that seriously do you? They sent tapes like that all over the Wasteland. Try bothering someone else.
FO300013462	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013463	Oh you mean that old "android recording?" Have you heard it? It's great. Here's a spare copy of that old holotape. It's either real or a great joke.
FO300013464	Yeah! It's really great isn't it? I mean, if it's real it's amazing, if it's fake, it's really funny. They sent tapes like that to doctors all over.
FO300013465	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013466	Story was there was an android, escaped from the Commonwealth up north. From someplace called the Institute.
FO300013467	Like I said, it's a hoax. Don't bother with it. Someone sent tapes like that to pretty much every doctor in the Wasteland. None of us believed it.
FO300013468	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013469	I had forgotten about that old hoax. Have you heard it? Here's a copy of that old  "android holotape." It's just some practical jokester.
FO300013470	It's a pretty elaborate practical joke. I mean, they sent a bunch of tapes like that to doctors all over the Wasteland.
FO300013471	Tell me more about this holotape about the android.
FO300013472	Do you know anything about some android who needed a surgeon?
FO300013473	Some VIP from up north looking for surgery and computer expertise. I don't pay attention to that crap, and neither should you.
FO300013474	Now that's an old story. If I recall, some runaway android was looking for a surgeon and, what? A computer expert, if I remember correctly.
FO300013475	You believe that ancient crap? Rumors of an escaped robot looking for a hacksaw and a computer expert. Forget about it.
FO300013476	Oh yeah! That crazy old story about an escaped robot, right? He was looking for a surgeon and a computer expert. Yeah, that sounds right.
FO300013477	MS08GREETING3
FO300013478	This could be an opportunity of a lifetime for you! I've misplaced some very sensitive property. And you will help me find it!
FO300013479	I'm listening.
FO300013480	MS08GREETING2
FO300013481	How amusing. You've mistaken my metaphor for a derogatory remark. I need a local, you see. Someone with verve.
FO300013482	I've misplaced some very sensitive "property."
FO300013483	You have a problem with the way I look?
FO300013484	MS08GREETING1
FO300013485	To the point. I like that. Well, as it turns out, I've misplaced some very sensitive "property."
FO300013486	That depends. What exactly are we talking about, here?
FO300013487	You should be nervous. Who says that I'm not here to kill you all?
FO300013488	"Give way your suspicions to the wisdom of thine Elder. Where he shows trust, so shall you," says the Codex.
FO300013489	Even if I don't understand why he would trust someone like you, I obey him and welcome you here. I only hope that you are a man of honor.
FO300013490	"Give way your suspicions to the wisdom of thine Elder. Where he shows trust, so shall you," says the Codex.
FO300013491	Even if I don't understand why he would trust someone like you, I obey him and welcome you here. I only hope that you are a woman of honor.
FO300013492	There's no need to be nervous. You can trust me.
FO300013493	It is not personal, anybody who has not taken the Oath of Fraternity is suspicious to us.
FO300013494	The Codex says: "Fear those who do not pledge to the Brotherhood for though their eyes may be opened through service, they are now blind"
FO300013495	But it also tells us "Give way your suspicions to the wisdom of thine Elder. Where he shows trust, so shall you".
FO300013496	Elder Lyons trusts you, so you are free to stay here.
FO300013497	"Give way your suspicions to the wisdom of thine Elder. Where he shows trust, so shall you," says the Codex.
FO300013498	Even if I don't understand why he would trust someone like you, I obey him and welcome you here. I only hope that you are a man of honor.
FO300013499	"Give way your suspicions to the wisdom of thine Elder. Where he shows trust, so shall you," says the Codex.
FO300013500	Even if I don't understand why he would trust someone like you, I obey him and welcome you here. I only hope that you are a woman of honor.
FO300013501	Understandable. I've met a lot of dangerous people myself.
FO300013502	It's not simply the outsiders that we are wary of, anybody who has not taken the Oath of Fraternity is suspicious to us.
FO300013503	The Codex says: "Fear those who do not pledge to the Brotherhood for though their eyes may be opened through service, they are now blind"
FO300013504	But it also tells us "Give way your suspicions to the wisdom of thine Elder. Where he shows trust, so shall you".
FO300013505	Elder Lyons trusts you, so you are free to stay here.
FO300013506	The honor is all mine, Squire.
FO300013507	You seem nervous, kid. Do I make you nervous?
FO300013508	And when we do, they're usually visiting Brothers. Outsiders are not to be trusted, so says the codex.
FO300013509	"Shield yourself from those not bound to you by steel, for they are the blind. Aid them when you can, but lose not sight of yourself".
FO300013510	Relax, Squire. I don't bite.
FO300013511	I plead for your pardon if my behavior offends you, sir. We don't get many visitors in the Citadel.
FO300013512	The Brothers and Elder Lyons are excellent teachers, but I get nervous about the protocols. The codex says that outsiders are not to be trusted.
FO300013513	"Shield yourself from those not bound to you by steel, for they are the blind. Aid them when you can, but lose not sight of yourself," it says.
FO300013514	I plead for your pardon if my behavior offends, ma'am. We don't get many visitors in the Citadel.
FO300013515	The Brothers and Elder Lyons are excellent teachers, but I get nervous about the protocols. The codex says that outsiders are not to be trusted.
FO300013516	"Shield yourself from those not bound to you by steel, for they are the blind. Aid them when you can, but lose not sight of yourself," it says.
FO300013517	Huh. Yeah, I guess I hadn't thought of it like that. Thanks… I appreciate the pick-me-up.
FO300013518	Look, the Enclave has the tech, they have the resources. But do they have the heart? I don't think so. We'll hold true.
FO300013519	Please. We'll win this. You know why? We need to. Hasn't that always been enough? You worry too much.
FO300013520	You're kidding me, right? Tin soldiers in devil suits, and you lose your nerve? Those Enclave troops are a joke.
FO300013521	The truth? We can barely fend off the Super Mutants. Now we have a new threat to contend with? Doesn't look good.
FO300013522	Have you seen that Enclave Power Armor? That's the Advanced Mark II! I don't know if a standard round can even penetrate that stuff!
FO300013523	Scribe Peabody was telling me about those Enclave Plasma weapons. You know they can turn a man to goo? How the hell do you defend against that?
FO300013524	CitTalk2
FO300013525	You heard what the others have been saying? About the Enclave?
FO300013526	I heard Elder Lyons talking to Rothchild. Sounds like even he's worried about the Enclave. Think I'm just being paranoid?
FO300013527	So what do you think?  Can we take these Enclave guys?
FO300013528	I ran some scans on the Enclave positions at the purifier. That's some serious firepower they're packing. What do you think?
FO300013529	Does this sound noble enough? "Quail before me, foul Super Mutant! Thine end is at hand! Yield, that I may ease thine suffering!"
FO300013530	Yes?
FO300013531	What's on your mind?
FO300013532	What is it?
FO300013533	I'm listening.
FO300013534	This is starting to sound risky, but I'll do anything to find my dad.
FO300013535	It IS risky. I would never lie to you.
FO300013536	But there's something behind those eyes of yours that screams "I'm the one who can get shit done"!
FO300013537	Your dad had that same look in his eyes too. That's why Three Dog's helping you.
FO300013538	This is starting to sound risky.
FO300013539	It IS risky. I would never lie to you.
FO300013540	But there's something behind those eyes of yours that screams "I'm the one that can get shit done"!
FO300013541	Your dad had that same look in his eyes too. That's why Three Dog's helping you.
FO300013542	I don't like the sound of this at all.
FO300013543	Oh, it gets worse.
FO300013544	So, after it gets blown up I look into how to replace the sucker.
FO300013545	Guess what? The factory that made the relay dishes is long gone. Leveled. As in, we'll never find that part again.
FO300013546	I see where this is going.
FO300013547	Yep. That shiny thing was our broadcast relay. Now it's swiss cheese. Without it, our broadcast range is quite limited.
FO300013548	Of course the factory that made the relay dishes is long gone. Leveled. As in, we're never gonna' scavenge that part again.
FO300013549	This is all a bit much for me. Let me get back to you.
FO300013550	Wow, I thought you were in a rush. Whatever, man. Chat me up when you're ready.
FO300013551	To find my Dad, I'm ready for anything.
FO300013552	Good, 'cause this isn't going to be easy.
FO300013553	Galaxy News Radio is my baby. I love it, I feed it, I keep it changed. But there's one problem, no one outside D.C. can hear her cry.
FO300013554	You see, some brainless Super Mutant thought it would be funny to shoot at the shiny round thing on the Washington Monument.
FO300013555	I'm ready for anything.
FO300013556	Good, 'cause this isn't going to be easy.
FO300013557	Galaxy News Radio is my baby. I love it, I feed it, I keep it changed. But there's one problem, no one outside D.C. can hear her cry.
FO300013558	You see, some brainless Super Mutant thought it would be funny to shoot at the shiny round thing on the Washington Monument.
FO300013559	Just wipe that stupid look off your face and answer my questions!
FO300013560	Whoa, whoa. Smoke a peace pipe. Take a deep breath and count to ten. Whatever it is you need to do to calm down.
FO300013561	You need Three Dog's help, and Three Dog needs your help. Let's get together and make it work.
FO300013562	What could I ever do for you? You seem to have everything you need here.
FO300013563	I have the name and the talent, but what I don't have are people to run out and do the stuff I need.
FO300013564	Sure, the Brotherhood watches over the place, yeah. But that's all they can spare.
FO300013565	Galaxy News needs a doer. Someone who can go out there into that wild, wooly world and get shit done. So, you game?
FO300013566	I hear things all the time. Most things aren't useful, but once and a while something will sneak up behind your girl and lift her dress.
FO300013567	Consider this your lucky day. I just so happen to know the location of an old military weapons cache untouched by time.
FO300013568	If you want to know more, you're going to have to contribute to the Good Fight.
FO300013569	If you know anything that can help me, I'd appreciate it.
FO300013570	You want to find your dad, and it just so happens his location is known to yours truly.
FO300013571	He was here, at Galaxy News. We had a great conversation. He's a real stand-up guy.
FO300013572	If you want to know more, you're going to have to contribute to the Good Fight.
FO300013573	You don't seem like you have much to offer if you spend all your time up here.
FO300013574	Hey, I may have the biggest mouth in the Capital Wasteland, but I've also got the biggest ears.
FO300013575	All sorts of people pass through our little oasis in the rubble and tell all sorts of interesting things.
FO300013576	You want to know something? Ask and we'll work it out.
FO300013577	Wait, why do you trust me so easily? I've never met you before.
FO300013578	The fact that the Brotherhood let you get up here tells me you're all right with them. That, and your Dad seemed a decent enough guy.
FO300013579	Besides, you're giving off a pretty sweet vibe right now. Maybe we can help each other out.
FO300013580	But enough yakkin'. Tell me why we're talking.
FO300013581	You know my father? Is he here? Please, I've been looking for him!
FO300013582	Hey, hey. One thing at a time. Nah, your old man ain't here. Not anymore.
FO300013583	He heard ole Three Dog on the radio, figured I knew what was what out here in the Capital Wasteland. And he was right. So I filled the old man in.
FO300013584	Nothing. Just wishing me a happy birthday.
FO300013585	Ha ha. Sure he was.
FO300013586	Anyway, I'm glad you're having a good time. I was afraid he would find some way to ruin your party.
FO300013587	Well, yeah! Where's my Dad gone?
FO300013588	When your dad passed through here, he and I talked for a good long time. He's a real stand-up kind of guy.
FO300013589	He mentioned some scientific mumbo-jumbo which didn't make sense to me and mentioned something called "Project Purity".
FO300013590	He also said something about going to visit a Doctor Li in Rivet City. Then, he left in a hurry.
FO300013591	Then Rivet City is where I'm headed. Goodbye, Three Dog.
FO300013592	Goodbye. Remember to keep us tuned in while you're out there, and watch yourself.
FO300013593	Rivet City? Where's that?
FO300013594	Well, a whole bunch of people got together and turned a beached aircraft carrier into a town. Pretty cool, huh?
FO300013595	Yeah, yeah. It was the thrill of a freakin' lifetime.
FO300013596	I suppose that's what you wanna know about that military weapons cache next?
FO300013597	I suppose that's what you wanna know next?
FO300013598	Thanks, Three Dog. I was just glad to help with the Good Fight.
FO300013599	Hey, you're the one who deserves all the thanks! You struck a major blow against tyranny!
FO300013600	Now GNR can be heard clear across the Capital Wasteland again. That'll give Eden and those Muties something to think about.
FO300013601	Hey, you're the one who deserves all the thanks! You struck a major blow against tyranny!
FO300013602	Now GNR can be heard clear across the Capital Wasteland again. That'll give Eden and those Muties something to think about.
FO300013603	But before I get back to my calling, I bet you wanna hear about that military weapons cache.
FO300013604	Hey, you're the one who deserves all the thanks! You struck a major blow against tyranny!
FO300013605	Now GNR can be heard clear across the Capital Wasteland again. That'll give Eden and those Muties something to think about.
FO300013606	But before I get back to my calling, I bet you wanna hear about your Dad.
FO300013607	Where's the Washington Monument?
FO300013608	Well, it's only the tallest thing left in the city.
FO300013609	When you step out of the Museum, take a good look across the Mall. You can't miss it.
FO300013610	Just be careful, there may still be a security barrier around it.
FO300013611	What's the best way to get to the Museum?
FO300013612	Head out the back door of GNR and take the Collapsed Car Tunnel to the other side of Dupont. Then take the metro tunnels until you're there.
FO300013613	So, what's your story?
FO300013614	Three Dog's seen it all. The Capital Wasteland at its ugliest.
FO300013615	People killed for scraps of food, wounded children wandering aimlessly. Some seriously fucked up shit.
FO300013616	If it wasn't for the Good Fight, I think I would have gone crazy by now.
FO300013617	Do you know anything helpful about the Museum of Technology?
FO300013618	Ha! Man's monument to his own demise. All the garbage they displayed in there is the reason half of the world was blown to shit.
FO300013619	That shithole is located just off the Mall. You know, that huge space in the center of the city in front of the Capitol.
FO300013620	Be careful, the whole place is swarming with Super Mutants.
FO300013621	Galaxy News Radio, huh? What's it all about?
FO300013622	Without this place, D.C. would be filled with that crap the Enclave keeps shoveling out on their "radio station," and festering with Muties.
FO300013623	Someone's got to tell the Wastelanders what time it is, and Three Dog is the one to do it.
FO300013624	No one knows what Eden and his Horsemen of the Apocalypse are up to, but you can be sure it isn't in the common man's best interest.
FO300013625	Tell me more about this relay.
FO300013626	Well, if you check out your radio, you can hear pretty good in this place. Get a few blocks away, still not too bad, maybe a little static.
FO300013627	With the relay back on, you'll hear GNR clearly in the whole Capital Wasteland area like it used to be.
FO300013628	No, the Vaults have been so much more. But only the Overseers have known the truth, and we've passed it down very carefully.
FO300013629	I had hoped to tell Amata when she took over, but with the way things are now, that doesn't seem likely to happen.
FO300013630	But if you could convince her and the rebels to give up this foolish demand to leave, then we can return to our Vault's vital mission.
FO300013631	I had no idea Vault 101 was so important. I just thought it was a fancy bunker.
FO300013632	I'm trying to save my people. Possibly the only pure, safe humans left in the world.
FO300013633	Don't destroy humanity's last chance just because you don't like the choices I've had to make to protect it.
FO300013634	I think you've got a good point. But things still need to change down here.
FO300013635	I'm glad we're in agreement, there. He left us all behind and caused quite a deal of trouble, all because he apparently got tired of the Vault.
FO300013636	As useful as his services were, in the end, he just wasn't willing to make sacrifices for the community.
FO300013637	Yeah, he was an asshole, all right. We're all better off without him.
FO300013638	No, but he didn't risk bringing you out into it, either.
FO300013639	You have to wonder, is that why he left you behind? He wanted to know you were someplace safe?
FO300013640	And then, like a fool, you squandered the greatest gift he ever left you.
FO300013641	At least my father didn't hide from the outside his whole life.
FO300013642	It's about time someone finished you!
FO300013643	And you're dead.
FO300013644	I expected nothing more from you.
FO300013645	And you're dead.
FO300013646	MS16OverseerWelcome3C
FO300013647	And what makes you so certain about that? I can't imagine you're still so naive after spending time in that hell outside.
FO300013648	None of them know what the outside is like, and most of them would die out there. Then the rest of us inside would eventually die out, too.
FO300013649	I won't risk all of our lives just for few people's passing fancy of taking a Wasteland vacation. I hope you can understand that.
FO300013650	The Vault doesn't have to be isolated in order to keep its residents safe.
FO300013651	I'm afraid you're the shortsighted one, here. I'm simply keeping them safe and untouched by the war above.
FO300013652	The real danger are the rebels and insurgents who insist on risking all of our lives just to die out there in the Wastes.
FO300013653	If they weren't trying to throw our lives away like that, we could go back to the peaceful life we once had. Everyone would be happy again.
FO300013654	You're not protecting your people, you're destroying them. Can't you see that?
FO300013655	Hardly. If anything, the only thing keeping it safe and pure is my strict supervision.
FO300013656	But I wouldn't expect you to understand. You were never really one of us, anyway. Your father was from the Wastes, and that's where you belong.
FO300013657	I think our meaningful discussion is at an end. I'm going to have to ask you to leave and never return. But death's always an option, too.
FO300013658	It won't ever be pure while you're in charge.
FO300013659	I've spent many nights asking myself exactly that. He certainly didn't tell me before he left.
FO300013660	I blame myself, really. I should have known better than to let him enter our home in the first place. He certainly showed his true colors in the end.
FO300013661	Were he raised in the cleanliness of our Vault, perhaps your father would have shown more dedication to the important things in life.
FO300013662	Just as well that he left. We mustn't let humanity's last pure specimens be sullied with his type.
FO300013663	Do you have any idea why my father left the Vault in the first place?
FO300013664	Ah, you're paying attention. Good for you.
FO300013665	These Vaults were designed to be safe havens for humanity, you see. But more than that, they were designed to test and protect us.
FO300013666	And none more so than our Vault 101. We are to be a pure and protected breed of humans, never tainted by the ravages of the war above.
FO300013667	What do you mean by the Vault's "future success"?
FO300013668	Spoken with all of the eloquence I'd expect from a wastelander.
FO300013669	Farewell, and feel free to enjoy your brutal hellscape above, savage.
FO300013670	Fine. You bastards can rot and die down here.
FO300013671	Spoken like someone who's never had to make difficult decisions. Like someone who's never had to lead.
FO300013672	Jonas was leaving with your father. Their departure would lead to others leaving as well. And before you know it, half of the Vault would be gone.
FO300013673	Don't try to justify your murders and lies. They were never threats.
FO300013674	I will. I know there are some that will miss you, much as there are still some that miss your father.
FO300013675	Not me, of course, but some of the others. Sentimental fools. But, you've restored peace to the Vault, and in that way, you're a hero.
FO300013676	And you have to leave. Thank you, and goodbye, Wastelander.
FO300013677	Please, pass along my farewell to everyone in the Vault.
FO300013678	First of all, I didn't kill Jonas. I commanded Chief Hannon to do so. But only because it had to be done.
FO300013679	Jonas was going to leave with your father. If he left, others would have left to join them. And they'd all vanish into the Wastes, never to return.
FO300013680	And with our numbers so depleted, we wouldn't be able to last beyond another generation. Assuming our expatriates didn't lead Raiders to us, first.
FO300013681	I'm sick of your lies! You murdered Jonas in cold blood!
FO300013682	I really don't recommend that sort of ultimatum. If you leave now, we can simply lock down the door controls and everyone can be happy.
FO300013683	But if you insist, we can always toss your corpse out the gate after you're killed.
FO300013684	The choice is yours. Goodbye.
FO300013685	I'll never leave Vault 101 again in my life.
FO300013686	What's the matter, runt? Did I hit a sore spot?
FO300013687	I always knew we shouldn't have taken him in, and it looks like I was right all along. A perfect example of why we need to keep the Vault shut!
FO300013688	Now, I'll make this easy for you. You can walk away and let me handle the Vault, or I can put you down like a rabid dog. Your choice, kid.
FO300013689	You shut up about my dad! Just shut up!
FO300013690	Really? And here I had expected you to be full of bullets and bravado, but short on brains. Perhaps you've grown up since you left our Vault.
FO300013691	I regret the unfortunate events of that night, but I'm afraid that once your father left us, they were unavoidable.
FO300013692	The sad truth is that his actions presented a real and direct threat to the future success of our Vault. And so, regrettably, they had to be opposed.
FO300013693	Lay off the evil banter. I'm just curious about your side of all this.
FO300013694	G.E.C.K.? We never had one of those things in the first place. We weren't supposed to ever leave, remember?
FO300013695	But take this Modified Utility Jumpsuit. I guess the rebels thought it would be useful when they left. Obviously, that won't be happening now.
FO300013696	Congrats, you saved the Vault. Now, get out.
FO300013697	I'll take your G.E.C.K., and whatever technology you can spare.
FO300013698	I'm afraid that, instead of a G.E.C.K., our Vault was supplied with technology better suited to functioning indefinitely.
FO300013699	But take this Modified Utility Jumpsuit. It seems the rebels thought it would be useful when they left. Obviously, that won't be happening now.
FO300013700	Thank you for saving our Vault. Now, you'll have to leave.
FO300013701	I'll take your G.E.C.K., and whatever technology you can spare.
FO300013702	Sure, fine. As it turns out, Brotch modified himself a utility jumpsuit for survival in the Wastes. As if he was ever getting out there.
FO300013703	Here, it's yours. Don't say I never repaid a favor. Now, get the hell out of my Vault.
FO300013704	I'll take scientific equipment. That's one thing you've got plenty of.
FO300013705	I think we may have just the thing, taken from the rebels not long ago. Edwin Brotch modified a utility jumpsuit for "survival in the Wastes."
FO300013706	It was a foolish idea, but that seems par for the course for them. I suppose they'd be happy to think it found its intended use, eventually.
FO300013707	But enough of that. Thank you for saving our Vault. Now, you'll have to leave.
FO300013708	I'll take scientific equipment. That's one thing you've got plenty of.
FO300013709	MS16OverseerWelcome1B
FO300013710	Really? Because you weren't here to talk with the last Overseer. That's why I'm in charge, now.
FO300013711	So you'll excuse me if I don't trust you, and if I don't think you've got my Vault's best interests at heart.
FO300013712	Now, I'll make this easy for you. You can walk away and let me handle the Vault, or I can put you down like a rabid dog. Your choice, kid.
FO300013713	Hold on, I'm here to talk.
FO300013714	That would be where you're wrong, young man. By locking down this Vault, I'm protecting its future.
FO300013715	In fact, I was protecting its future when I had to make those unpleasant choices the night you and your father abandoned us.
FO300013716	I only wish I could have stopped your father before he left. If anyone's to blame for the unpleasantness, it's him.
FO300013717	With your leadership, no one in this Vault has much of a future.
FO300013718	Useful stuff out there, I'll bet. And if it'll get you back out there faster, then all the better.
FO300013719	We don't have much, but here you go. Now, get.
FO300013720	I'll take my payment in food and ammo.
FO300013721	Ah, of course. The basic currency of a lawless society. Maybe you'd like a few pointed sticks and fighting dogs, as well?
FO300013722	We don't have much ammunition down here, but we should be able to spare some packaged meals.
FO300013723	Here, perhaps it'll be of some comfort to you once you return to the Wastes. Now, go.
FO300013724	I'll take my payment in food and ammo.
FO300013725	Is that what they say? And you believed them? Ha!
FO300013726	Why, if it weren't for me, they'd go outside and die in seconds flat. They're just caught up in the idea of a change, is all.
FO300013727	Now, I'll make this easy for you. You can walk away and let me handle the Vault, or I can put you down like a rabid dog. Your choice, kid.
FO300013728	You're the one who's been holding his people hostage!
FO300013729	I assume you're talking about the unpleasantness when you left, yes?
FO300013730	Jonas and your father were endangering the future success of this Vault and the safety of its residents.
FO300013731	I did what I had to do to keep them from destroying all we had achieved here. I only wish I could have prevented it from happening at all.
FO300013732	Tainted? You're the crazy bastard who murdered Jonas!
FO300013733	You really think I'll let you stay? You're out of your tiny little mind.
FO300013734	Now, pick something I can shove in your arms before tossing you outside for good.
FO300013735	Returning to stay in the safety of the Vault is reward enough.
FO300013736	Did you really think you would be allowed to stay? Yes, you've saved the Vault, to be sure. And, thus, probably the last pure humans in the world.
FO300013737	All the more reason to keep you from returning to our community and polluting it with the taint of outside barbarism.
FO300013738	Now, reconsider your request and pick a reward you can take with you when you return outside, wastelander.
FO300013739	Returning to stay in the safety of the Vault is reward enough.
FO300013740	The person you should be convincing is the Overseer. Go talk with him.
FO300013741	I'll find a way to convince you, just wait.
FO300013742	I deeply doubt it. But your naive ramblings do have a certain entertainment value.
FO300013743	I'll find a way to convince you, just wait.
FO300013744	You mean, there really are deadly threats out there? It hasn't all just been lies to keep us down here?
FO300013745	I guess I never thought that was actually true. But I can tell you really mean it about the Enclave. I couldn't risk leading them to the Vault.
FO300013746	The Overseer's actually protecting you from a deadly group called the Enclave.
FO300013747	Damnit, I told them I won't let this degenerate into violence again! The Vault simply can't take the instability anymore!
FO300013748	But maybe you're right. They simply can't stand the pressure anymore, and now the purity and perfection of my Vault is crumbling all around me.
FO300013749	You can't even keep your security in line. They're planning to raid the rebels.
FO300013750	It is? Even with a crazy dictator running the show?
FO300013751	I guess we do have renewable food and water, impenetrable defenses, and a wealth of active technology. Those must be rare outside, huh?
FO300013752	Isolation keeps the Vault safe. It's insane to give that up.
FO300013753	And I still say we're not giving up on our chance to with the outside world.
FO300013754	I still say it's insane to give up the safety of the Vault.
FO300013755	My God, you're right. We won't last another hundred years, whether or not we get supplies from the outside.
FO300013756	We're the last bastion of pure humanity, and we're doomed.
FO300013757	You simply don't have enough people to stay isolated down here forever.
FO300013758	The mission of this Vault has always been to ensure a safe haven for pure humans. We owe it to our species to keep to that mission.
FO300013759	You'll never survive down here, isolated from the rest of the world.
FO300013760	I should have remembered. I was just worried, I don't know, maybe your time outside had changed you.
FO300013761	Thanks, and good luck talking to him. Let me know when you change his mind!
FO300013762	You know violence isn't my style, Amata. Don't worry.
FO300013763	Maybe he has some reason. Just, please don't kill him. We've already had too many deaths.
FO300013764	Sorry, I'm not promising anything. He'll be stopped, one way or another.
FO300013765	I understand, but please don't kill him. We've already lost so many, and violence isn't going to bring them back.
FO300013766	Sorry, I'm not promising anything. He'll be stopped, one way or another.
FO300013767	Please, for my sake, don't hurt him.
FO300013768	Don't hurt him? Are you crazy? He tried to kill you!
FO300013769	Please, for my sake, don't hurt him.
FO300013770	Don't hurt him? Are you crazy?
FO300013771	But we don't even have that chance while my father's got the place locked down. Please, something has to be done. You know that better than anyone.
FO300013772	It's a dead world out there. You're better off down here, even with a madman.
FO300013773	But we don't even have that chance while the new Overseer's got the place locked down. Please, something has to be done!
FO300013774	It's a dead world out there. You're better off down here, even with a madman.
FO300013775	And all this time, we're living in a tiny world that's been falling apart for two hundred years.
FO300013776	If we don't take a chance out there, we're just going to die down here.
FO300013777	But none of that can happen while my father's got the place locked down. Please, something has to be done. You know that better than anyone.
FO300013778	There's more out there than we ever imagined. Good, bad, and in-between.
FO300013779	And all this time, we're living in a tiny world that's been falling apart for two hundred years.
FO300013780	If we don't take a chance out there, we're just going to die down here.
FO300013781	But none of that can happen while the new Overseer's got the place locked down. Please, something has to be done. You know that better than anyone.
FO300013782	There's more out there than we ever imagined. Good, bad, and in-between.
FO300013783	But none of that can happen while my father's got the place locked down. Please, something has to be done. You know that better than anyone.
FO300013784	There are other survivors -- some are even doing better than the Vault.
FO300013785	But none of that can happen while the new Overseer's got the place locked down. Please, something has to be done. You know that better than anyone.
FO300013786	There are other survivors -- some are even doing better than the Vault.
FO300013787	It turns out that all of our parents were in on it. Your dad more than most, I guess.
FO300013788	But for some reason, they closed the door when we were babies, and swore to pretend the outside was uninhabitable.
FO300013789	But now people have died for that lie, and even though we know the truth, the Overseer still won't let us try to contact the outside!
FO300013790	What? How long did you know about this?
FO300013791	You know what? Never mind. What's important is that now we know that we were lied to all our lives, and that people have died for that lie.
FO300013792	And even now, when we most need help, the Overseer still won't let us try to communicate with the outside!
FO300013793	Yeah, I found out about that when I left. I guess I should have told you.
FO300013794	I heard we sent a couple of scouts outside, long ago. Maybe the suit was theirs.
FO300013795	The Vault was open for a while, but for some reason, they closed it off when we were babies and everyone swore to deny it had ever happened.
FO300013796	But then Jonas died, and they're keeping us locked in here, all to protect that fantasy of remaining "untainted" by the outside world!
FO300013797	That explains why I found an old Vault 101 suit outside.
FO300013798	After that night, I heard Wally's father say we should never have taken you or your dad into the Vault.
FO300013799	I found out the Vault used to be open, but for some reason, they closed it off when we were babies and swore to hide it had ever happened.
FO300013800	But keeping that lie meant Jonas's death. And even though we know the truth, the Overseer still won't let us make our own decisions!
FO300013801	What? How did you find that out?
FO300013802	What the hell do you mean? Take a look around! If we weren't dying down here before that night, we're definitely on our way now.
FO300013803	How much worse could it be if we tried to leave? There has to be something out there worth finding.
FO300013804	What? You think they've got some explanation for their side of the story? You think you can trust anything they say?
FO300013805	All those people died because my father claimed he wanted to keep the Vault safe and secure. But all this time, that's been a lie!
FO300013806	I found out that he opened the Vault years ago, before we were born. And they've been lying to us about it for our entire lives!
FO300013807	Let's not be hasty. I need to know more before I make any decisions.
FO300013808	Chaos doesn't even cover it! It's a nightmare down here!
FO300013809	People died that night, and all because my father went crazy to keep someone from opening the Vault.
FO300013810	I may have left, but this is still where I grew up. I can't leave it in chaos.
FO300013811	There are still so many things to repair, and a lot of bad feelings to mend. Some people still blame you for what happened.
FO300013812	So I have to ask you to leave. I'm sorry, but the situation is just too delicate for you to stay.
FO300013813	Please, if you really want to help the Vault, you have to go.
FO300013814	I've got a bad feeling about this. What is it?
FO300013815	You saved us. But that doesn't change the fact that you killed one of us to do it, and I can't let that sort of thing stand here.
FO300013816	I guess it's a bit familiar. You've already been forced out of the Vault once before. At least now you know what's out there.
FO300013817	I've got a bad feeling I know where this is going.
FO300013818	I just wish we could have saved more people. Jonas, and the Hannons, and so many others died that night.
FO300013819	It was bad enough they died because my father was trying to keep the door closed, but then I found out it was all to protect a lie!
FO300013820	I found out, the Vault wasn't always closed! They've lied to us about it for our entire lives!
FO300013821	You saved my life back then, Amata. The least I can do is help out now.
FO300013822	I know you are, and on behalf of the Vault, I thank you for all you've done. But there are still many who blame you for everything that happened.
FO300013823	So I have to ask you to leave. I'm sorry, but the situation is just too delicate for you to stay.
FO300013824	Please, if you really want to help the Vault, you have to go.
FO300013825	Whatever it is, I'm glad to help.
FO300013826	I realize that. And I don't blame you. If you hadn't been here, maybe one of us would have done the same.
FO300013827	You saved us. But that doesn't change the fact that you killed the Overseer in cold blood to do it, and I can't let that sort of thing stand here.
FO300013828	I did what had to be done. And I'd do it again if necessary.
FO300013829	Most of the people in here will just get themselves killed out there. You know that better than anyone. But down here, they've got a safe life.
FO300013830	And while we're down here, I'm in charge. Like the G.O.A.T. said: "To whom do we owe everything you have, including our lives?"
FO300013831	The Overseer! And that's me!
FO300013832	I just want to know why you won't open the Vault.
FO300013833	What? Have you gone crazy from radiation or sunstroke or whatever they've got out there?
FO300013834	This place is a police state and we're on the edge of a civil war. If you won't help for me, at least do it for your home!
FO300013835	Don't flatter yourself, Amata. I'm just here to take care of a few loose ends.
FO300013836	Well, thanks for keeping your cool and not resorting to violence. That sort of thing would only lead to more problems in the future.
FO300013837	It's time for our dusty old Vault to have a new beginning. And it'll start by opening it up again, and this time for good.
FO300013838	He didn't even realize how wrong he was. But I set him straight.
FO300013839	You bastard, that's still my father you're talking about!
FO300013840	As new Overseer, my first action is to banish you from Vault 101 forever. Whatever sort of friend you used to be, the Wasteland's changed you.
FO300013841	Now get out of my Vault, murderer.
FO300013842	It shouldn't be a surprise. I said I'd kill him, and I did.
FO300013843	You bastard, that's still one of our people you're talking about!
FO300013844	As new Overseer, my first action is to banish you from Vault 101 forever. Whatever sort of friend you used to be, the Wasteland's changed you.
FO300013845	Now get out of my Vault, murderer.
FO300013846	It shouldn't be a surprise. I said I'd kill him, and I did.
FO300013847	I missed your sense of humor, but I really don't think this is the time for jokes.
FO300013848	We're in real trouble, and your help could make all the difference. So could you please take this seriously, for me?
FO300013849	I just happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop by.
FO300013850	It's hard to forgive what he's done, but I suppose I can understand why he did it. I'm glad you brought him to his senses.
FO300013851	But now there's a new Overseer in charge! And I'm planning on opening the Vault, this time for good.
FO300013852	Oh, I will, believe me. We can open up limited trade with nearby settlements and other areas, and see the world we've been missing.
FO300013853	But it's still important that I protect our Vault, and keep the people within it safe from the dangers of the Wasteland.
FO300013854	Even when those dangers have helped us in the past. And that makes the rest of this even harder.
FO300013855	That's the way these things go. Now do the right thing for your Vault.
FO300013856	Oh, thank you! Everything's gone crazy since you left, and now that you're back, you can help set things straight.
FO300013857	I came as soon as I heard you were in trouble.
FO300013858	You and him? Civil? I expected you to change out in the Wasteland, but not that much!
FO300013859	But I guess we'll all be learning a bit about the outside now, won't we? As the new Overseer, I'm planning on opening the Vault, this time for good.
FO300013860	I just had a little talk with him and explained a few things. All quite civil.
FO300013861	But you're right. I don't have time to grieve just because I lost my father. The Vault needs a leader now.
FO300013862	That makes the rest of this even harder.
FO300013863	I'm sorry about your father, but now the Vault can have a real leader.
FO300013864	But you're right. We don't have time to grieve. The Vault needs a leader now. That makes the rest of this even harder.
FO300013865	I'm sorry it had to end that way, but now the Vault can have a real leader.
FO300013866	I can't do that. Not officially, at least. As much as some of the rebels would like to talk with you, the Overseer said you weren't welcome back.
FO300013867	Of course, if you survived whatever's out there, none of us could stop you if you really wanted to cause problems. But I'd prefer if you don't.
FO300013868	Well, let me through. I've got work to do.
FO300013869	I probably ought to put you under arrest and take you in to the Overseer, but frankly, I know better than to try that.
FO300013870	Meanwhile, some of your old friends think opening the Vault is a good idea. I bet those rebels would like a word with you. Now, more than ever.
FO300013871	Of course, if you want, you can just walk away as if you were never here. Out of respect for your dad, I won't even tell anyone I saw you.
FO300013872	So what now?
FO300013873	To tell the truth, I don't really blame him for all that. I don't know why he left, but I do know he'd never intend for all that to happen.
FO300013874	But when the smoke cleared, other people started thinking about opening the vault permanently. And that didn't go down well with the Overseer.
FO300013875	He's been coming down hard on them, and that's where it stands now. At least, until you walked in here.
FO300013876	Yeah, Dad screwed up all of our lives that day, didn't he?
FO300013877	To tell the truth, I don't really blame him for all that. I don't know why he left, but I do know he'd never intend for all that to happen.
FO300013878	Even so, we lost a lot of people that night, including the Overseer himself. He was replaced by Allen Mack, Wally's dad, and things seemed all right.
FO300013879	But some of your friends started talking about opening the vault for good, and he came down hard on them. Things are pretty tense, now.
FO300013880	Yeah, Dad screwed up all of our lives that day, didn't he?
FO300013881	Matter of fact, a lot of folks started thinking he had the right idea. He usually did. So if it was safe out there, why stay down here forever?
FO300013882	Well, the Overseer didn't like that one bit, and started cracking down on that sort of thought. Guess he didn't plan on you coming back.
FO300013883	You're not alone in that, though. In all the chaos, Amata lost her dad, too. Lots of us lost family, to tell the truth.
FO300013884	Now Allen Mack's the Overseer, and he's taking a hard stance against those who want the vault to open again.
FO300013885	Really? Well, that would explain a few things, all right. It's a good thing you're here, after all.
FO300013886	After that night, a lot of your friends started thinking, "If it's safe to go outside, why stay down here forever?"
FO300013887	And that's not the sort of thing the Overseer likes to hear. Things have gotten pretty tense.
FO300013888	That was never supposed to happen! That was the Overseer's fault!
FO300013889	He wasn't the only one who didn't make it to morning. It was a horrible, horrible night.
FO300013890	Believe it or not, it was Allen Mack who really stepped up in the crisis. Wally's dad really saved some lives, and got named the new Overseer for it.
FO300013891	Then, just when some hoped he might open the door for good, he declared martial law and said the place would stay sealed off forever.
FO300013892	That was the Overseer's fault, and he paid for it that night.
FO300013893	That'd be Allen Mack. You remember, Wally's dad.
FO300013894	He was something else when those fires started burning. In fact, if it weren't for him, we'd have lost a lot more than we did.
FO300013895	Afterwards, well, he seemed like a natural for the job of Overseer. He's tough, but I guess we could probably use that right about now.
FO300013896	So, who's the Overseer now?
FO300013897	Technically, this means I'm supposed to report her. To tell the truth, I'm supposed to report you being here, too.
FO300013898	But I've been getting mighty forgetful in my old age, you know? We've got more than enough trouble without me adding to it.
FO300013899	That's a risk I'm willing to take.
FO300013900	Maybe. She isn't the only one, that's for sure.
FO300013901	Ever since that night, it's been madness down here. Nothing but trouble.
FO300013902	I mean, I just had a hunch she was in trouble.
FO300013903	It wouldn't have if your father hadn't ruined everything by opening that door!
FO300013904	Things were just fine until he decided to take a little walk! Then we had bug attacks, confusion, and chaos! And with no doctor, too!
FO300013905	Everything went crazy, is what happened. Your dad opened that door, bugs started attacking, and people started going crazy.
FO300013906	When the smoke cleared, there were a lot of casualties and not many answers.
FO300013907	Didn't help that our doctor had just left, either.
FO300013908	What's happened down here since I left?
FO300013909	Let me bring you up to speed. It seems like it's been a mighty long time.
FO300013910	The night you and your dad left, everything went crazy. Between the bugs and the confusion, we lost a lot of people.
FO300013911	When your dad opened up that gate, he let loose a whole lot of crap, if you'll pardon my language.
FO300013912	What sort of trouble do you mean?
FO300013913	This isn't some sort of hotel, you know! You don't just come and go as you please. I thought you were raised better than that!
FO300013914	Sorry, it's just been pretty rough down here since you and your dad left.
FO300013915	There's real trouble brewing, and you don't want to be a part of it.
FO300013916	Don't mind me. I'm just here to pick up some stuff I left behind.
FO300013917	MS16Violence
FO300013918	The way I see it, if you and the rebels are dead, all these problems are over.
FO300013919	What a coincidence! I was thinking just the same thing!
FO300013920	I think I'll just kill you, now.
FO300013921	I expected nothing less from you.
FO300013922	I still owe you for Jonas. Now shut up and die, you son of a bitch.
FO300013923	What exactly do you mean by that?
FO300013924	You need to understand the dangers outside, and why you should stay here.
FO300013925	You know what? I hear the last Overseer tried being reasonable about things, and you killed him for his efforts.
FO300013926	I think I'll skip the "reasonable" thing and just kill you now.
FO300013927	Be reasonable. You need to open the Vault.
FO300013928	Oh, do you? What makes you think you know how better to protect this Vault?
FO300013929	The rebels are right. You need to open the Vault.
FO300013930	You will? Thank goodness for that. No matter what I say, he just doesn't listen. He just spends all day up in his office.
FO300013931	But you've actually been outside, so you can tell him what it's like with firsthand experience!
FO300013932	I swear, I'll stop your father and his guards. Just watch.
FO300013933	You will? Thank goodness for that. No matter what I say, he just doesn't listen. He just spends all day up in his office.
FO300013934	But you've actually been outside, so you can tell him what it's like with firsthand experience!
FO300013935	I swear, I'll stop the Overseer. Just watch.
FO300013936	I'm okay, I just worry about how long we have before someone does something rash.
FO300013937	I'm trying to stop the Overseer. Just be patient.
FO300013938	Huh. I wasn't expecting to hear that!
FO300013939	Okay, here's the deal: You go and get them to quit this Vault-opening nonsense, and I'll let you leave. Heck, I'll even throw in some pay.
FO300013940	I agree with you. Let me get the rebels to stop.
FO300013941	Hmm. You always have held a certain sway with them that neither I nor my guards have enjoyed.
FO300013942	All right, then. Go to my daughter and convince her to leave this rebellious nonsense behind.
FO300013943	I'll put a stop to the rebels. Just let me have a word with them.
FO300013944	You're lucky I'm in a good mood. Get to it.
FO300013945	I'm working on stopping the rebels. Give me a little more time.
FO300013946	All right, but I expect results. Get to work.
FO300013947	I'm working on stopping the rebels. Give me a little more time.
FO300013948	You're leaving us? You're leaving me?
FO300013949	I guess what my father said was right. Now that you've been out there, you stopped caring about anyone but yourself.
FO300013950	We don't need your help. We'll take care of ourselves. You can just get out, and never come back!
FO300013951	The more I hear, the less I want to be involved at all. I'm leaving, forever.
FO300013952	You're leaving us? You're leaving me?
FO300013953	I guess what the Overseer said was right. Now that you've been out there, you stopped caring about anyone but yourself.
FO300013954	We don't need your help. We'll take care of ourselves. You can just get out, and never come back!
FO300013955	The more I hear, the less I want to be involved at all. I'm leaving, forever.
FO300013956	That should save us all some trouble. Now get moving, before I decide to make an example of you.
FO300013957	You know, I just don't care anymore. Let me leave and I'll never come back.
FO300013958	As I always suspected. You never cared about the Vault. Now that you've been outside, you're nothing more than a ignorant savage.
FO300013959	But by all means, feel free to see yourself out. I'm sure you know the way.
FO300013960	You know, I just don't care anymore. Let me leave and I'll never come back.
FO300013961	MS16GuardViolence
FO300013962	What?
FO300013963	There's only one solution, here. Death, and lots of it. You get to be first!
FO300013964	Well, I can't blame you. I'll change the passwords behind you, and we'll figure out a way to work things out for ourselves.
FO300013965	We've made it on our own for this long. I'm sure this'll blow over in time, too.
FO300013966	Best of luck to you out there, kid. Don't worry about us.
FO300013967	This is too messed up. I'm leaving again. Just pretend I never came back.
FO300013968	Okay, let's try this slowly. When you and your daddy left, there were problems. Those problems were bad.
FO300013969	Amata and some others said we should try opening the door and going outside more. The Overseer said that was bad, too, and he got angry.
FO300013970	Now, just about everyone's angry down here. And things are still bad. Really bad.
FO300013971	I still don't get what's going on.
FO300013972	Okay, follow me.
FO300013973	I need to see Amata. Lead me to her.
FO300013974	We're already headed there. Just stay quiet and follow me.
FO300013975	I need to see Amata. Lead me to her.
FO300013976	<sighs> Okay. Hope no one asks too many questions.
FO300013977	Actually, could you escort me to Amata? I need to talk to her about all this.
FO300013978	As chance would have it, she was one of the first people to talk about life outside the vault after you left. No surprise; she always did like you.
FO300013979	Could you escort me to Amata? I need to talk to her about all this.
FO300013980	Okay, follow me.
FO300013981	I think I'd like to have a talk with the Overseer. Take me to him.
FO300013982	We're already headed there. Can't you smell the fire and brimstone?
FO300013983	I think I'd like to have a talk with the Overseer. Take me to him.
FO300013984	You sure you know what you're doing?
FO300013985	On second thought, maybe I don't want to know. Just follow me.
FO300013986	I think it's time to have a talk with the Overseer. Take me to him.
FO300013987	I hope you know what you're doing. I don't think he's going to be happy to see you.
FO300013988	Follow close to me, and I'll escort you down to him.
FO300013989	I think I'd like to have a talk with the Overseer. Take me to him.
FO300013990	You just thought you'd pop in? Don't take this the wrong way, but you probably ought to just turn around and not come back.
FO300013991	This isn't the happy vault you grew up in, anymore. There's real trouble.
FO300013992	I just thought I'd stop back home for a bit. How's the old Vault?
FO300013993	Amata's message? I don't know what you're talking about, but I'd keep that under your hat, for her sake.
FO300013994	She could get in real trouble if people found out she sent you a message. So could I, just for talking with you now.
FO300013995	I need to talk with Amata. I got her message.
FO300013996	Hell no, crazy girl. I won't be your lab rat.
FO300013997	Well, I'll still be here if you change your mind. Plenty to work on without that book, anyway.
FO300013998	Okay, I guess I'll help with this "Survival Guide."
FO300013999	All right, then! Now, I think the first chapter will have to be about surviving day-to-day dangers.
FO300014000	Things like where it is and isn't safe to find food, the dangers of radiation, and how to avoid and even profit from dangerous landmines.
FO300014001	Ooh, sounds like fun, doesn't it? Which do you want to do first?
FO300014002	Well, you do what you have to, I suppose. But the offer'll still be open, if you change your mind.
FO300014003	It's tempting, but I'll have to pass.
FO300014004	Oh sure, because the angel of death really needs a helping hand out there. I guess "almost everyone in the world" didn't quite meet his quota.
FO300014005	Just stay out of my way until you reconsider that, okay? Some of us actually give a damn about the survival of the species.
FO300014006	Doesn't sound like my style. I'm out.
FO300014007	Let's see, dealing with radiation, testing an experimental device, and I won't lie, it may include some reading. That sort of stuff, you know?
FO300014008	But for all that, I can pay you with caps, meds, chems, and maybe even a few of those unique inventions, if you do a good job. Interested?
FO300014009	Pay? What sort of pay? And what sort of work?
FO300014010	"Target"? Whoa, no, no, no! It's not that sort of job! No, I'm talking about researching things like surviving in the Wastes and such.
FO300014011	And I can offer caps and meds and a few of my inventions in return. I guess I can even get you some ammo, if that's more your style.
FO300014012	Pay? You just said the magic word. Name the target.
FO300014013	Not interested. I'm just here to do some shopping.
FO300014014	Well, okay, I guess. But I promise, you'll love it when you hear about the guide. Maybe later, huh?
FO300014015	Sorry, I must have you confused with somebody else. Forget I mentioned it.
FO300014016	Hmph. No one else could do it, that's for damn sure.
FO300014017	Just get out of here. Can't you leave an old man in peace? And stay away from my stuff!
FO300014018	Hope the Mirelurks get you, damn nosy kid.
FO300014019	Maybe 100 caps will jog your memory?
FO300014020	It's things like bottlecaps, and property, and ownership and all that nonsense that makes a person think he's better than another. Bah!
FO300014021	But I'll take your caps just the same. This android came in as one person, and he left as someone else. I replaced his face AND his memories!
FO300014022	Don't believe anyone's done that before. Certainly not down here. That Commonwealth tech isn't all that fancy when it comes down to it.
FO300014023	I'm also the only one in the Wasteland with the skill and the nerve to perform facial surgery. That android flesh ain't so different than ours.
FO300014024	You want proof? I documented the whole thing. So I could rub it in the face of Dr. Li when I need to rankle her feathers. I hate that snooty bitch.
FO300014025	Let's just say it's in your best interest to tell me what I want to know.
FO300014026	Fine, whatever. This android, calls himself Harkness now, comes in and wants a memory job. I took new memories, and replaced his old ones.
FO300014027	Don't believe anyone's done that before. Certainly not down here. That Commonwealth tech isn't all that fancy when it comes down to it.
FO300014028	I'm also the only one in the wasteland with the skill and the nerve to perform facial surgery. That android flesh aint so different than ours.
FO300014029	You want proof? I documented the whole thing. So I could rub it in the face of Dr. Li when I need to rankle her feathers. I hate that snooty bitch.
FO300014030	Let's discuss the facial reconstruction and mind wipe you did for the Android.
FO300014031	What're you talking about, boy? I don't know anything about any of that, and a what-did-you-call-it? An android? What's that?
FO300014032	What are you talking about, girl? I don't know anything about any of that, and a what-did-you-call-it? An android? What's that?
FO300014033	Like I've said, I suspect he's had facial reconstruction, and possibly even a mind wipe.
FO300014034	Start with Doctor Preston. He lives on this leaky boat. See if he knows anything. He's a "doctor" after all.
FO300014035	Now, if you'll excuse me. I'm busy trying to ignore my surroundings.
FO300014036	Like I've said, I suspect he's had facial reconstruction, and possibly even a mind wipe.
FO300014037	Search the offices of doctors or techies for android information. If he's come into contact with these people, there may be records.
FO300014038	Start with Doctor Preston. He lives on this leaky boat. See if he knows anything. He's a "doctor" after all.
FO300014039	Now, if you'll excuse me. I'm busy trying to ignore my surroundings.
FO300014040	I've found your android. It's Harkness, Rivet City's security chief!
FO300014041	Thank you for your discreet assistance, and continued discretion regarding this matter.
FO300014042	And now for your payment. This combat module will directly affect your central nervous system. I think you will find it quite beneficial.
FO300014043	I'm still looking, don't worry. I'll find him.
FO300014044	How quaint. Of course you'll be rewarded! I have at my disposal advanced technology from the Commonwealth.
FO300014045	I'd be willing to share some of it with you. Just think, you'll be the envy of all your friends!
FO300014046	Tell me, Zimmer. Is your wallet as big as your mouth?
FO300014047	I'm sorry, it slipped my mind. I have at my disposal advanced technology from the Commonwealth.
FO300014048	I'd be willing to share some of it with you. Just think, you'll be the envy of all your friends!
FO300014049	I'm not sure how it is up north, but around here, we get paid for our work.
FO300014050	Of course. I have at my disposal advanced technology from the Commonwealth.
FO300014051	I'd be willing to share some of it with you. Just think, you'll be the envy of all your friends!
FO300014052	I'll be compensated for my services, right?
FO300014053	Isn't it quite clear? You are to locate my android!
FO300014054	He must have done something drastic, like facial surgery and a mind wipe, or else I would have found him by now.
FO300014055	It will be no easy task. He may not even realize he's an android. Don't upset him by talking with him. Just come get me immediately. I'll handle it.
FO300014056	Enough techno-babble, Zimmer. Just tell me what you want me to do.
FO300014057	MS08GREETINGB2
FO300014058	You're helping me retrieve this android! Aren't you?
FO300014059	I've tracked him this far. He's out there, somewhere. In the Capital Wasteland.
FO300014060	He must have done something drastic, like facial surgery and a mind wipe, or else I would have found him by now.
FO300014061	It will be no easy task. He may not even realize he's an android. Don't upset him by talking with him. Just come get me immediately. I'll handle it.
FO300014062	Nonsense! This is a machine we're talking about. Can you enslave a generator, or a water purifier? Of course not. The same principle applies.
FO300014063	But let's get back to your mission. You are to find this missing android. I've tracked him to somewhere here in the Capital Wasteland.
FO300014064	He must have done something drastic, like facial surgery and a mind wipe, or else I would have found him by now.
FO300014065	It will be no easy task. He may not even realize he's an android. Don't upset him by talking with him. Just come get me immediately. I'll handle it.
FO300014066	Sounds like slavery to me. You sure they don't "wander off" on purpose?
FO300014067	MS08GREETINGA3
FO300014068	You'll be searching for an android! Do you know what an android is? No, I imagine you don't.
FO300014069	Cut to the chase, Zimmer. What's the job?
FO300014070	Ah, a woman of action. I knew I picked the right person for the job! Let me be clear, you won't be looking for a lost puppy or family heirloom.
FO300014071	You'll be searching for an android! Do you know what an android is? No, I imagine you don't.
FO300014072	You see, we've moved beyond those primitive buckets you call robots, and have created Artificial Intelligence. Sentient machines!
FO300014073	Artificial persons that think and feel what we program them to. Occasionally their programming miscalculates, they get confused and wander off.
FO300014074	Cut to the chase, Zimmer. What's the job?
FO300014075	You see, in the Commonwealth, we've made artificial persons. Synthetic humanoids! Programmed to think and feel and do whatever we need.
FO300014076	Missing property? What kind of property?
FO300014077	Looks like you could use a weapon.
FO300014078	I'll take whatever you've got at this point.
FO300014079	Hell, yeah! Lay it on me.
FO300014080	Oh wow, cool. What've you got for me? Minigun? Flamer? Maybe a missile launcher?
FO300014081	You're going to need a weapon if you want to live to see Big Town.
FO300014082	MS01RedA3
FO300014083	You think I asked those Super Mutants to wait until I got all my caps together before abducting me?
FO300014084	Don't get me wrong. I'm terribly grateful. I'll gladly give you a reward.  But let's get out of here first.
FO300014085	"Thanks"? That's all I get for risking my life to save you? How about some caps?
FO300014086	That's right, his birthday was recently. I can't wait to talk with him!
FO300014087	I'm glad you're safe. There's a guy name Sticky that wants to see you.
FO300014088	That's right, his birthday was recently. Did he make it to Big Town already? I can't wait to see him!
FO300014089	I'm glad you're safe. There's a guy named Sticky that wants to see you.
FO300014090	Don't I know it! Now the trick is getting out of here.
FO300014091	You're lucky I happened along.
FO300014092	Me too! I'm extremely lucky you came along!
FO300014093	I'm glad you're alive.
FO300014094	Okay, I'll help you.
FO300014095	Then let's get out of here! Don't forget we've got to get Red, too. She's still upstairs in the holding pens.
FO300014096	You don't have to tell me twice. Let's get out of here!
FO300014097	Sorry, I'm not here to rescue you. In fact, I've got to get going.
FO300014098	You can't just leave me here! They're going to eat me!
FO300014099	What makes you think I'm here to rescue you?
FO300014100	That isn't funny! We've got to get out of here before the Super Mutants come back to have me for lunch!
FO300014101	Hold on, short stuff. Who are you and what are you doing here?
FO300014102	What does it look like? The Super Mutants raided Big Town and dragged me off here. I'm sure they're about to eat me. You can't just leave me here!
FO300014103	Mock you? I'd rather kill you.
FO300014104	All right then, let's go.
FO300014105	Right behind you.
FO300014106	No, I just wanted to look at it.
FO300014107	This is no time for games! This is my life we're talking about here! Look, are you ready to go? Let's just get out of here.
FO300014108	Yeah, it's jammed good. I can't help you.
FO300014109	Sure can. Here, just pull this back to clear the chamber.
FO300014110	Sure can. Here, just pull this back to clear the chamber.
FO300014111	Damn! Look, I'll just keep my head down and follow you. You do your best to cover me.
FO300014112	Don't worry about it. Just keep your head down and let's get out of here.
FO300014113	Okay, just be sure to cover me. With my gun jammed, I'm pretty useless in a fight.
FO300014114	Your gun is jammed? Can I take a look at it?
FO300014115	Sure, I guess. Can you fix it?
FO300014116	So, you're a representative of the mighty Brotherhood? Please.
FO300014117	You can mock me all you want, I don't care. Just get me out of here.
FO300014118	Calm down. I'm here to help.
FO300014119	Oh, thank God. Paladin Hoss sent you, didn't he? I knew he wouldn't leave me behind.
FO300014120	When they attacked, we were cut off so quickly. My gun jammed and I never even got a shot off. I couldn't do anything but hide.
FO300014121	I've heard enough. Let's go get your man.
FO300014122	Excellent. We will advance forward slowly until we make contact with the Mutants and clear the area in front of the building.
FO300014123	Once that space is under our control, we will hold position while you enter and recover the Initiate. Then you both should evac to the exterior.
FO300014124	You will receive your payment when the Initiate is returned to us alive. Let's move out.
FO300014125	Excellent. We will advance forward slowly until we make contact with the Mutants. Then clear the area in front of the building.
FO300014126	Once that space is under our control, we will hold position while you enter and recover the Initiate. Then you both should evac to the exterior.
FO300014127	What's in it for me?
FO300014128	100 caps is all I can offer you. Take it or leave it.
FO300014129	100 caps? How much is really in it for me?
FO300014130	Typical. You wasteland dogs have no honor. Very well, I will pay you 100 caps for your aid.
FO300014131	What sort of exercise were you doing out here?
FO300014132	Long range recon. We typically do them in areas that have already been swept and are thought to be clear.
FO300014133	Knight Church fell in the initial strike, the Initiate was cut off, and we were forced to retreat.
FO300014134	Is the initiate still alive?
FO300014135	He's had enough training that he should know that when facing overwhelming odds, a Brother's best recourse is to wait for reinforcements.
FO300014136	I suspect that he is making a stand inside of that building, but an Initiate won't be able to stand for long against those Mutants
FO300014137	I'm sorry, I can't help you.
FO300014138	What's wrong, merc? Price not high enough? Be gone. This is better handled without the aid of an outsider.
FO300014139	Unfortunate, but understandable. However, we must make haste. Farewell, stranger.
FO300014140	Fuck off, boy scout. I'm not here to help you.
FO300014141	Very well, then. I should have expected as much from an outsider.
FO300014142	What's happening here?
FO300014143	We were performing a training exercise with one of the Initiates when we were cut off by the Super Mutants.
FO300014144	We saw him flee into a building up ahead during the attack, but before we could link up with him, we were pushed back.
FO300014145	Now that we've cleared this area, we can press forward and attempt to recover the initiate. I only pray that he is unharmed.
FO300014146	Have you seen C.J. Young lately?
FO300014147	I thought I saw her and James heading to the gate bridge.
FO300014148	They know better than to cross over though. It's dangerous out there.
FO300014149	I thought I saw them running over the bridge.
FO300014150	It couldn't have been them though. Children aren't allowed over there alone.
FO300014151	Yeah. I caught them trying to sneak over the bridge.
FO300014152	Children aren't allowed to leave without an adult, so I chased them off.
FO300014153	Same thing happened a few months ago, but they found a way to get over there anyway. I hope that hasn't happened this time.
FO300014154	Christie told me they were missing. I'll alert the rest of the security guards.
FO300014155	Henry told me her and James were missing. I'll have security keep an eye out for them.
FO300014156	I heard she and James were missing. I'll have security keep an eye out for them.
FO300014157	You mean that brat my James hangs around with?
FO300014158	No. I'm not surprised they've gone missing. The two of them are always causing trouble.
FO300014159	You brought her back to me!
FO300014160	Thank you for saving my little girl.
FO300014161	I found C.J. She was on the lower deck with James Hargrave.
FO300014162	Thank you for finding C.J.
FO300014163	I was worried sick about her.
FO300014164	I found C.J. She was on the lower deck with James Hargrave.
FO300014165	This is your mess, kid. Get yourself out of it.
FO300014166	You're still an asshole. Well, guess what. I'm going to follow you anyway.
FO300014167	And if you aren't going back, we'll just stay here.
FO300014168	You're just mean! I hope your Mom and Dad die!
FO300014169	Sure, kid. Sorry I said those things. Let's get you home.
FO300014170	Thanks, mister.
FO300014171	Thanks, lady.
FO300014172	Thank you, mister. I promise to be good from now on.
FO300014173	Thank you, ma'am. I promise to be good from now on.
FO300014174	Ooh! That hurt! Do us all a favor and just run away from home.
FO300014175	I'll show you. I'll show all of you!
FO300014176	When I'm gone, my mom will really miss me.
FO300014177	Go jump off the flight deck, asshole.
FO300014178	Your mother's a bitch and you're a spoiled little punk.
FO300014179	I've met your mother. No wonder you're such a brat.
FO300014180	Poor James. His mother drinks too much. When she does, she doesn't treat him very well.
FO300014181	Personally, I think she blames him for his father leaving her, which is ridiculous.
FO300014182	What's the deal with that little punk, James Hargrave?
FO300014183	James' mom, Tammy, is a real bitch. She treats him like crap.
FO300014184	I think it's because she drinks too much.
FO300014185	Why is James Hargrave such a brat?
FO300014186	That poor child. His mother, Tammy Hargrave, is a very troubled woman.
FO300014187	She spends too much time down in the Muddy Rudder, drinking and using foul language.
FO300014188	I feel so sorry for him. I think CJ is a good influence on him, but I do worry about the two of them.
FO300014189	Why do you let that James Hargrave kid play with your daughter?
FO300014190	He's trouble, that's what he is.
FO300014191	I don't trust him, and neither should you.
FO300014192	His mother is a drunk. Spends all her time in the Muddy Rudder.
FO300014193	What's up with that James Hargrave kid? He acts like such a brat.
FO300014194	I don't think so. I've got questions.
FO300014195	Just make it quick. There's a bottle with my name on it.
FO300014196	What do you mean, my Dad is "gone"?
FO300014197	Leave me alone. I'm trying to get some sleep.
FO300014198	No! You've got to get up. Right now! If my father's men catch you here, I don't know what will happen.
FO300014199	Don't be a smart-mouth! This is serious!
FO300014200	My father's men are looking for you. They've already killed Jonas. You've got to get out of here!
FO300014201	Oh, gross! Knock it off, this is serious!
FO300014202	My father's men are looking for you. They've already killed Jonas. You've got to get out of here!
FO300014203	Huh? What's wrong, Amata?
FO300014204	You've got to get out of here! Your dad is gone and my father's men are looking for you!
FO300014205	But this is impossible. I can’t be a robot! I’m a human being.
FO300014206	I breathe, I eat. Hell, I cut myself shaving this morning. I was bleeding! Robots don’t bleed!
FO300014207	Threaten me all you want, but I have pictures and an audio testimony!
FO300014208	This doesn't prove anything. All it proves is someone took a picture of me, and took a picture of some other guy.
FO300014209	You'll need more than this, though I can see why you thought it was important. But stop worrying about it. I'm sure this is just some kind of joke.
FO300014210	Threaten me all you want, but it won't change the facts. I have pictures!
FO300014211	I need to SEE something to believe it.
FO300014212	You'll need more than this, though I can see why you thought it was important. But stop worrying about it. I'm sure this is just some kind of joke.
FO300014213	Threaten me all you want, but it won't change the facts. Listen to this!
FO300014214	Proof
FO300014215	But this is impossible. I can’t be a robot! I’m a human being.
FO300014216	I breathe, I eat. Hell, I cut myself shaving this morning. I was bleeding! Robots don’t bleed!
FO300014217	The facts will speak for themselves. I have pictures and an audio testimony!
FO300014218	This doesn't prove anything. All it proves is someone took a picture of me, and took a picture of some other guy.
FO300014219	You'll need more than this, though I can see why you thought it was important. But stop worrying about it. I'm sure this is just some kind of joke.
FO300014220	I know you don't believe me, but it won't change the facts. I have pictures!
FO300014221	I need to SEE something to believe it.
FO300014222	You'll need more than this, though I can see why you thought it was important. But stop worrying about it. I'm sure this is just some kind of joke.
FO300014223	I know you don't believe me, but it won't change the facts. Listen to this!
FO300014224	Threaten me all you want, but it won't change the truth!
FO300014225	Truth? If there's one thing I've learned it's this: There is no such thing as "THE Truth," just the appearance of truth.
FO300014226	And for anyone to try to sell their version of the truth, they need evidence.
FO300014227	You have no evidence for your ridiculous claims. So I have no more time to waste talking with you.
FO300014228	I know you don't believe me, but I'm telling the truth!
FO300014229	Truth? If there's one thing I've learned it's this: There is no such thing as "THE Truth," just the appearance of truth.
FO300014230	And for anyone to try to sell their version of the truth, they need evidence.
FO300014231	You have no evidence for your ridiculous claims. So I have no more time to waste talking with you.
FO300014232	It's your decision. I'm sure you'll do the right thing.
FO300014233	But I clearly can't stay here where Zimmer can find me and expose my true nature. I'll figure something out.
FO300014234	You're more than "just a machine." You're a person, Harkness. You belong here.
FO300014235	You're right. I have friends here. And Rivet City needs me to protect it.
FO300014236	Even if they found out, they know me. They won't care if I'm made of real flesh and bone, or synthetic parts. Right?
FO300014237	I'll need to take care of Zimmer, though, one way or the other.
FO300014238	Thanks for warning me. Here's a little token of my gratitude. It's the best weapon I've ever had. And it seems like I've had it forever.
FO300014239	People will kill you when they find out. The Commonwealth is where you belong.
FO300014240	You're right. It's not safe for me here. I don't know what I'll face in the North, but from the way Zimmer talks about it, it sounds like a paradise.
FO300014241	Thank you for helping me make the right decision. Here's a little token of my gratitude. It's the best weapon I've ever had. And I've had it forever.
FO300014242	Go tell Zimmer I'm ready to go home.
FO300014243	Zimmer's waiting. He'll want to take you home now.
FO300014244	I don't know what I should do. I have a good life here. I protect these people and take care of them. I'm important here.
FO300014245	But what if people were to discover I'm not human? That I'm really... a machine?
FO300014246	Don't worry, Harkness. Your secret is safe with me.
FO300014247	Here's a little token of my gratitude. Best weapon I've ever had, and I've had it forever.
FO300014248	I suppose if I'm careful I could trump up some charges and throw him out...
FO300014249	I want to thank you for warning me about Zimmer, and for keeping this a secret. Here's a little token of my gratitude.
FO300014250	Sometimes you have to kill the bad guys.
FO300014251	Thank you for warning me about Zimmer, and for keeping this a secret. Here's a little token of my gratitude. Best weapon a man could ask for.
FO300014252	Just do me a favor and don't go blasting up my boat. People discharging weapons on my boat tends to get me nervous.
FO300014253	Unless I'm the one doing the shooting. To kill dangerous thieves from the Commonwealth, for instance.
FO300014254	Actually, I was hoping you'd let me kill him.
FO300014255	Don't think this gives you license to run around shooting anyone you want. Just Zimmer, and that bodyguard, if he gets in the way.
FO300014256	Here, use my weapon. I've had it forever, and it's never let me down. Consider it a token of my appreciation.
FO300014257	What are you going to do about Zimmer? He's the one you were running away from.
FO300014258	I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to shove him into a very small box, and send him north where he belongs.
FO300014259	I can see you aren't going to believe me. Never mind. Forget I said anything.
FO300014260	Quit wasting my time! If I catch you bothering anyone else, I'll make you wish you never set foot on this boat.
FO300014261	Now get out of my sight!
FO300014262	You're a robot from the Commonwealth. You belong to a man named Zimmer.
FO300014263	Are you out of your mind? I've never been to the Commonwealth. I never even heard of the place before Zimmer arrived.
FO300014264	I'm definitely NOT a robot. Do I look like a robot? And I'm certainly no man's property. Did Zimmer put you up to this?
FO300014265	You have exactly five seconds to explain what it is you're trying to do here, or you'll be leaving Rivet City by way of the nearest porthole.
FO300014266	Those memories of your wife aren't real. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
FO300014267	But I'm not here to talk about my private life. You're starting to piss me off. Did Zimmer put you up to this?
FO300014268	You have exactly five seconds to explain what it is you're trying to do here, or you'll be leaving Rivet City by way of the nearest porthole.
FO300014269	We need to talk.
FO300014270	That's what my wife said right before she left to go live with her mother.
FO300014271	What's the problem?
FO300014272	I'm being completely serious. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
FO300014273	Have you been hitting Paulie's private stash? Just what I need. More strung-out chem heads on my boat.
FO300014274	You have exactly five seconds to explain what it is you're trying to do here, or you'll be leaving Rivet City by way of the nearest porthole.
FO300014275	I don't suppose you know that you're a robot, do you?
FO300014276	I had a feeling you were going to be a problem. I should never have let you in here.
FO300014277	Is this your idea of a practical joke? In case you haven't noticed: I'm not laughing.
FO300014278	This isn't an existential debate. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
FO300014279	Excuse me?
FO300014280	Look, kid. You have exactly five seconds to explain what you're trying to do here, or you'll be leaving Rivet City by way of the nearest porthole.
FO300014281	What's that supposed to mean?
FO300014282	Look, kid. I don't have time for existential debate. And I'm not interested in whatever religion you're peddling.
FO300014283	Look, I know he's in here. I mean, in the Vault.
FO300014284	Your father? Oh, I had no idea. This is simply too rich.
FO300014285	He's the reason you came here? I mistakenly assumed you had simply blundered in here on your own.
FO300014286	Well, this certainly changes things, doesn't it? I daresay it gives you a whole new level of motivation to avoid angering me.
FO300014287	You mean the man that came here is your daddy?
FO300014288	And you're only here because you're looking for him?
FO300014289	Oh, this is just too much fun! We're going to have SUCH a good time! Let's play right now!
FO300014290	He's an older guy, around 50 or so.
FO300014291	Well now, doesn't this just change everything!
FO300014292	I should have suspected there was some reason behind my recent good fortune.
FO300014293	Perhaps you'll get to see him, in time.
FO300014294	He looks like me, but older. He's got to be here.
FO300014295	And he's new here too, isn't he?
FO300014296	Oh, boy. He's your daddy, huh? I had no idea!
FO300014297	That makes this even MORE fun! Let's play!
FO300014298	He's a scientist. He's looking for Doctor Braun.
FO300014299	Oh my. What a splendid turn of events. I had no idea the two of you were related!
FO300014300	Yes, I have indeed seen him. I'm afraid he's rather unavailable at the moment.
FO300014301	Ha ha ha! THAT'S your daddy?
FO300014302	Oh, we're going to have SO much fun! This is going to be the best game ever!
FO300014303	What the hell's going on here?
FO300014304	We're going to play a game now, silly. That's what's going on.
FO300014305	No thanks. No games for me.
FO300014306	Ha ha. You don't get to say no.
FO300014307	If I want to play a game, you're going to play. And I want to.
FO300014308	I knew you would!
FO300014309	It's a really simple game. All you have to do is make Timmy Neusbaum cry.
FO300014310	Oh goodie!
FO300014311	It's a really simple game. All you have to do is make Timmy Neusbaum cry.
FO300014312	What? I don't live here.
FO300014313	You do now.
FO300014314	You live here until I say you don't.
FO300014315	I know! Why don't we play a game?
FO300014316	Is this some kind of a game?
FO300014317	Do you like games? I love to play games!
FO300014318	I know a really fun game we can play.
FO300014319	I'm looking for my father. Have you seen him?
FO300014320	Gee, I don't know. What's he like?
FO300014321	How do you know who I am?
FO300014322	I know everything, my dear boy.
FO300014323	I know everything, my dear girl.
FO300014324	You've seen my father? Where is he?
FO300014325	Oh, I don't think we're quite ready to talk about that. We haven't even been formally introduced yet.
FO300014326	Who is Betty?
FO300014327	Oh, you know Betty.
FO300014328	You really shouldn't keep her waiting.
FO300014329	I'm Betty. I live here on Tranquility Lane. Want to play a game?
FO300014330	George Neusbaum. Proud resident of Tranquility Lane. Good to meet you, sport.
FO300014331	Where am I?
FO300014332	This is Tranquility Lane. We all live here, and now so do you.
FO300014333	Ha ha, such a kidder. You're on Tranquility Lane, of course! Where else would you be?
FO300014334	I'm trying to convince Harkness he's an android, but he wants proof.
FO300014335	There's an audio log he himself recorded before the mind wipe. I've already told you, it's on my computer. There's also before and after pictures.
FO300014336	Download those things and show him. That will be all the proof he needs.
FO300014337	But I'm telling you, be careful. Harkness is wound tight. If you go poking holes in his reality, he might come undone. Trust me. You don't want that.
FO300014338	RCPackageEnd
FO300014339	Damn! I forgot to eat breakfast again.
FO300014340	I'd better get back to the museum.
FO300014341	Oh! Look at the time. I'd better go get something to eat.
FO300014342	I'd better get back.
FO300014343	Dad, my shift's over. I'm going to do some shopping.
FO300014344	I'd better get home. Dad will be worried.
FO300014345	See you tomorrow night, Diego.
FO300014346	Well, I need to go open up.
FO300014347	I'm out of here.
FO300014348	Closing time.
FO300014349	<yawn> I'm tired.
FO300014350	Another day, another dollar.
FO300014351	Shit. I've got a Council meeting.
FO300014352	Think I'll get something to nibble on.
FO300014353	Where did I put that food?
FO300014354	I'm getting tired. Watch the bar, Brock.
FO300014355	Belle! Time to get up!
FO300014356	Maybe I'll go topside.
FO300014357	That's enough fresh air for one day.
FO300014358	I suppose I can make do with my old gun for another week.
FO300014359	Let me know if you get anything new in, Bannon.
FO300014360	I'm going to take a food break, Belle.
FO300014361	Enough chit-chat. I need to get to work. Those halls won't clean themselves.
FO300014362	This deck is as good as it's going to get today. I need to move on to the mid-deck.
FO300014363	My feet are killing me. Time to go home. I'll finish this up tomorrow.
FO300014364	I hope Paulie hasn't injected all our inventory.
FO300014365	Bannon! Wait for me!
FO300014366	Oh, boy! I'm hungry.
FO300014367	I'm going to go play with James.
FO300014368	Bye, James.
FO300014369	<burp> Time to go on patrol.
FO300014370	I think I'll get some air out on the Flight Deck.
FO300014371	I'm full. Time for a nap.
FO300014372	I'm getting kind of hungry.
FO300014373	Think I'll go exploring.
FO300014374	Good morning, Father Clifford.
FO300014375	We should go get some breakfast, Father Clifford.
FO300014376	It's time for our evening meal, Father Clifford.
FO300014377	We should be heading to the clinic, Father Clifford.
FO300014378	Angela, let's go up to the Flight Deck. It's more private up there.
FO300014379	It's late. We should go home, Angela.
FO300014380	Think I'll go get some lunch.
FO300014381	Well, if anyone needs me, I'll be in my room.
FO300014382	That was a fine meal. I've got to get back to my patients.
FO300014383	Well, Janice, I need to get going.
FO300014384	Doctor Li, it's been a pleasure, but it's late and I have to go.
FO300014385	Doctor Preston, I'll be back in a couple of days to visit with your patients again.
FO300014386	Church services are held every Sunday morning. I hope to see you there.
FO300014387	Mister Buckingham, it was delicious, as always.
FO300014388	Vera, it was a feast. God bless you.
FO300014389	I've heard enough for tonight.
FO300014390	Think I'll go have some fun.
FO300014391	Better open up. The breakfast crowd will be here soon.
FO300014392	I'm beat, I'm going to go take a nap.
FO300014393	I'm going to grab a bite to eat.
FO300014394	Time to lock up. Tomorrow starts early.
FO300014395	Whoa! Almost overslept. Angela wouldn't be happy about that.
FO300014396	I'm going top side for a while.
FO300014397	Time to call it a day.
FO300014398	Time for my walk around.
FO300014399	Think I'll walk the flight deck.
FO300014400	I'm bushed. Think I'll turn in.
FO300014401	Time for the Council meeting. Don't want to be late.
FO300014402	Time for breakfast. Let's go.
FO300014403	We'll be late for church. Hurry up.
FO300014404	I'm off to work.
FO300014405	I need to run up to the tower for a few hours.
FO300014406	Quittin' time. I can't wait to get home.
FO300014407	Quitting time. I'm heading home.
FO300014408	<yawn> Time to go to bed.
FO300014409	I'm done, mom. I'm going to go play with C.J.
FO300014410	I'm done, mom. I'm going to go play.
FO300014411	I've got to go home, or my mom will kill me.
FO300014412	Thank you, Cindy.
FO300014413	I should get back.
FO300014414	It's getting late. I should go.
FO300014415	Think about what I've said Ted.
FO300014416	Someday, maybe I'll get courage.
FO300014417	Thank you, Father Clifford. I'll think about what you've said.
FO300014418	Oh! Got to get to the store. Cindy will kill me if I'm late again.
FO300014419	Oh! Got to get to the store.
FO300014420	Man, that is some good shit! I am really jazzed now.
FO300014421	Closing time. I hope Vera waits for me.
FO300014422	Goodnight Vera.
FO300014423	Damn. I feel hung over.
FO300014424	Finally. Time to close shop.
FO300014425	I suppose I ought to get to work.
FO300014426	Almost out of caps. I'd better go.
FO300014427	Time to get drunk.
FO300014428	I'll get you yet, you bastard.
FO300014429	Time to go get drunk.
FO300014430	I gotta go to bed. Gotta sleep this off.
FO300014431	I need a drink.
FO300014432	Where's James? I've got to go find my brat.
FO300014433	Sit down and mind your manners.
FO300014434	Don't embarrass me, brat.
FO300014435	Oh, man. I got the itch. I'm heading up to see Cindy.
FO300014436	This should do it. Thanks, Cindy.
FO300014437	Oh, yeah. That's what I needed.
FO300014438	I should check in with my guests.
FO300014439	Maybe I'll get Buckingham to fix me something to eat.
FO300014440	I think I'll just pop up to the Flight Deck.
FO300014441	I'm getting a chill. I should go home.
FO300014442	No sign of him, Armitage. Let's look elsewhere.
FO300014443	Well, he's obviously not here.
FO300014444	Let's search a different deck today, Armitage.
FO300014445	I should really begin the search.
FO300014446	Sure, kid. Whatever you say.
FO300014447	That's right! It IS whatever I say! Boy, you learn fast.
FO300014448	Hey, I know! Let's play a fun game!
FO300014449	Look, kid. I'm not interested in playing games.
FO300014450	I said, I want to play a game.
FO300014451	Then I guess you'll never find out where your daddy is.
FO300014452	I said, I want to play a game.
FO300014453	They've never loved you. In fact, they both hate you and wish you were dead.
FO300014454	No, no! Not my mommy and daddy! Nooo!
FO300014455	[crying]
FO300014456	They know what you did, and they're leaving you here all alone.
FO300014457	I won't wet the bed again, I promise! I promise!
FO300014458	[crying]
FO300014459	Sorry, Timmy. I just thought you should know.
FO300014460	No, no! Not my mommy and daddy! Nooo!
FO300014461	[crying]
FO300014462	Hey, I heard your parents are getting a divorce because of you.
FO300014463	What? Did I do something bad?
FO300014464	What kind of a game is this?
FO300014465	It'll be funny. Come on, you'll see.
FO300014466	Make him cry, and then come back here, and we'll talk some more.
FO300014467	That's it? I can do that.
FO300014468	You can? I guess we'll see, huh?
FO300014469	Good luck!
FO300014470	What? That's crazy!
FO300014471	No, Timmy's the one who's crazy. You'll see.
FO300014472	Make him cry, and then come tell me. Maybe we can talk some more then.
FO300014473	What's the Brotherhood doing here?
FO300014474	We have a relationship with the station here. We stay in this reinforced structure, and protect it from the Super Mutants.
FO300014475	This is the only real safe spot in the ruins of D.C. The rest of the place is crawling with those walking abominations.
FO300014476	It's nice to have a port in the storm, you know?
FO300014477	"Free voice of the people"? What does that mean?
FO300014478	Well, the only other station that comes through nice and clear on the radio is the Enclave's station.
FO300014479	All they spew is a bunch of nonsense and propaganda. Galaxy News Radio reports on what's really happening.
FO300014480	I need to speak to Three Dog.
FO300014481	You can head right on up. He's waiting for you.
FO300014482	Oh, go right on up. You were expected.
FO300014483	Three Dog is right upstairs.
FO300014484	What's this building for?
FO300014485	You got a Pip-Boy. Tune into Galaxy News Radio and listen. It's the only radio station in the Capital Wasteland that tells it like it really is.
FO300014486	This is the last free radio station in the entire D.C. area. The rest of the airwaves are clouded up with Enclave propaganda.
FO300014487	I wouldn't believe a word they say anywhere else.
FO300014488	This is Galaxy News Radio, the last free voice of the people of the Wasteland. The Brotherhood of Steel makes sure of that.
FO300014489	Nah, I guess you're right.
FO300014490	Sorry, sir. I'll do my best.
FO300014491	Good. Then I can show you who's a better shot!
FO300014492	Yes, sir. Sorry sir!
FO300014493	Hehe. You'll get your chance, brother. Be patient.
FO300014494	Very good, sir. I'll be sure and keep my eyes open.
FO300014495	Thanks, brother. It takes a great amount of practice and even more patience.
FO300014496	Agreed, brother. That was a little too close for comfort. I'll be more careful.
FO300014497	Besides the Super Mutants, just anything out of the ordinary. Citadel's orders.
FO300014498	Good, carry on, soldier.
FO300014499	I'm always expecting something. I just don't want to be caught unawares when it springs on us.
FO300014500	What's up, sir? Expecting something in particular?
FO300014501	I always do, sir. Is there something we should be expecting?
FO300014502	Anything in particular we should be looking out for?
FO300014503	Yes, sir. I am locked and loaded.
FO300014504	Yes, that was an excellent shot, brother. I can only hope to be as good as you someday.
FO300014505	It was a good thing you did, brother. He was about to have you for lunch. You shouldn't be so reckless.
FO300014506	Just ready to take down some Super Mutants, brother. Otherwise, all quiet.
FO300014507	No new orders yet, brother. We're to remain here until further notice and assist any reinforcements that may arrive.
FO300014508	Don't worry brother, we'll see plenty of action here, I can promise you that.
FO300014509	If it's action you want, how about cleaning up this pigsty of a barracks!
FO300014510	If you'd rather run around out there with all those Super Mutants, be my guest.
FO300014511	You'll do what our orders say, soldier. I'm getting a bit tired of your complaints.
FO300014512	CitTalk5
FO300014513	Pretty dire, huh? Thanks for completely ruining my day.
FO300014514	MS16GomezStopEscort
FO300014515	If you want to go on alone, it's your call.
FO300014516	Just... don't stir up too much trouble down here, okay? You may be used to the outside, but this is all the world some of us have.
FO300014517	I can take it from here.
FO300014518	Okay, then.
FO300014519	Never mind.
FO300014520	Yeah, real funny.
FO300014521	It is kind of funny, but for a different reason. Tranquility Lane is different than most places. People here don't stay dead.
FO300014522	You stay dead, so you better watch out.
FO300014523	How can I have another chance?
FO300014524	Tranquility Lane is special. If people die here, they don't really stay dead. Well, most people anyway.
FO300014525	Now, Timmy will be back to normal any second now. Then you can try again.
FO300014526	If your father killed Jonas, I'm going to make him pay.
FO300014527	And they think you're part of it! You know how paranoid my father is anyway. This has pushed him right over the edge.
FO300014528	You can worry about revenge later. Right now you've got to get away before security gets here!
FO300014529	What does any of this have to do with me?
FO300014530	Maybe you don't know anything about it, but my father sure thinks you do.
FO300014531	You can't let him catch you. I think he'd kill you. I really do.
FO300014532	What? Jonas is dead? What the hell is going on?
FO300014533	Big deal. Your dad's mad at my dad. What's that got to do with me?
FO300014534	Aren't you listening? Your dad is gone! From the Vault! He opened the main door and left!
FO300014535	My father has completely flipped out. I've never seen him like this. He ordered the guards to beat Jonas. To death. And now they're looking for you!
FO300014536	Good for Dad. About time someone stood up to the Overseer. No offense.
FO300014537	You don't understand! Your dad somehow opened the main door and left the Vault!
FO300014538	I'm not afraid of your father's thugs. You should know that by now.
FO300014539	Well, you'd better start being afraid! I just watched them beat Jonas, over and over again! They killed him!
FO300014540	Now shut up and listen to me!
FO300014541	Why would they be looking for me? I haven't done anything.
FO300014542	This isn't about some stupid prank. Your dad left the Vault somehow, and now my father's gone crazy. Jonas is dead!
FO300014543	So you'd better listen to me and get moving if you don't want to end up like him!
FO300014544	CitScribeReport1
FO300014545	Power systems are 90% at startup, but are running at 37% efficiency after coming fully online. I'm looking into what might be causing the leak.
FO300014546	CitScribeIFFResponse
FO300014547	Damn it. Well, he's not loaded but I still don't like the idea of him viewing us all as targets. See if you can lock it down.
FO300014548	How do I get out of here?
FO300014549	Simply put, you leave when I say so. This place is under my control, and I dictate the terms. If I decide to let you go, you may go.
FO300014550	Where's my father?
FO300014551	Ah, yes. A predictable question, I suppose.
FO300014552	Your father is here, in Tranquility Lane. He is quite safe for now, though he can no longer hound me with his incessant questioning.
FO300014553	Perhaps you will see more of him in time.
FO300014554	Your father?
FO300014555	What is this place?
FO300014556	Tranquility Lane is a simulation, a reality designed to play home to the denizens of Vault 112.
FO300014557	It was my last and greatest project. I am quite grateful that I was placed directly in charge of it.
FO300014558	Just who are you?
FO300014559	I was known as Dr. Stanislaus Braun, but here I choose this identity.
FO300014560	Do you find it unsettling? In this place I can choose to be whatever I wish, and this is what I have chosen.
FO300014561	You will find that I control a great deal around here.
FO300014562	That's crazy even for your father. What's happening?
FO300014563	They think you're part of it. And I don't think they'll be interested in listening to your explanations!
FO300014564	Shutting up and listening.
FO300014565	Jonas must have helped him escape, and when my father found out, he kind of went crazy.
FO300014566	They think you're part of it. And I don't think they'll be interested in listening to your explanations!
FO300014567	You're not going to cry, are you?
FO300014568	No. Why should I cry? He was your friend, not mine.
FO300014569	I came here to help you. If you still want my help, we'd better get going.
FO300014570	Yeah. Don't worry about me. I'm just sorry you had to find out like this. I know Jonas was your friend.
FO300014571	But we've got to go, now. My father's men will be here any minute!
FO300014572	So I guess maybe it is time to get moving.
FO300014573	I finally got your attention, huh? Jonas is dead, in case you were wondering. He helped your dad escape, and they killed him for it!
FO300014574	Now let's get you the hell out of here before you're next!
FO300014575	I'm listening now. What's happened to Jonas?
FO300014576	I snuck out to warn you as soon as they were gone.
FO300014577	Why didn't you say they were killing people? Let's get out of here!
FO300014578	That's what I've been trying to tell you!
FO300014579	Maybe it's none of my business, but... you seem just as surprised as me to learn your dad has left. Didn't he tell you what he was planning?
FO300014580	Tell me who killed Jonas. They won't get away with this!
FO300014581	I don't know! Some of my father's men.
FO300014582	Look, that doesn't matter right now! You need to worry about getting out of here alive! Revenge will have to wait.
FO300014583	So, Mr. Paranoid has finally gone over the edge?
FO300014584	Goddamn it! Stop making jokes and listen to me! Jonas is dead! Do you understand what I'm saying to you? My father ordered the guards to do it!
FO300014585	And now they're coming here to do the same thing to you! This is not a joke! You need to get out of here!
FO300014586	I've never seen you so scared, Amata. What's happened?
FO300014587	I'm not sure that I can handle this, Three Dog.
FO300014588	Well, I guess I was wrong about you. Maybe you don't have that spark.
FO300014589	I would never make a man do what he doesn't want to do. That's what freedom is all about.
FO300014590	But I have to stick to the deal. No dish, no dad. You'll be on your own. You sure you want it that way?
FO300014591	All right. How can I help?
FO300014592	One of the Brotherhood guys that passed through here mentioned seeing a dish in one of D.C.'s old museums.
FO300014593	It's the dish off of the old Virgo II Lunar Lander in the Museum of Technology.
FO300014594	I want you to get it and bring it to the Washington Monument to replace the bad one. That's it.
FO300014595	Super Mutants? Blowing things up? This sounds out of my league.
FO300014596	Hey, I understand this isn't easy. I mean, most people would be crazy to even try what I'm about to propose.
FO300014597	But there's something behind those eyes of yours that screams "I'm the one who can get shit done"!
FO300014598	Your dad had that same look in his eyes too. That's why I'm helping you.
FO300014599	What else do I have to do?
FO300014600	An excellent question. Timmy was easy, and therefore boring. I desire some real entertainment.
FO300014601	The Rockwells are the picture of a happy marriage. Change that. Split them up, without killing either of them.
FO300014602	If you can do that, I'll have a good laugh and then we'll talk some more.
FO300014603	You can't do this to me!
FO300014604	On the contrary, I believe you'll find that here, I can do most anything I like.
FO300014605	Now, let's discuss your next task.
FO300014606	The Rockwells live such a happy life. Their marriage is the cornerstone of that life.
FO300014607	Destroy their marriage. How you do it is up to you, but you may not kill either of them.
FO300014608	I'm not playing anymore of your games.
FO300014609	No? Then I'm afraid you'll never be leaving.
FO300014610	I decide when you may leave, and unless you start cooperating, you're going to have a very long stay here on Tranquility Lane.
FO300014611	MQ08GuardSay01a
FO300014612	Yes sir! I'll have the techs come down and remove it immediately, sir.
FO300014613	Right away, sir!
FO300014614	Excellent. Prepare her for transport immediately.
FO300014615	Excellent. Prepare him for transport immediately.
FO300014616	Yes sir! She'll pass out shortly, but we can revive her.
FO300014617	Yes sir! He'll pass out shortly, but we can revive him.
FO300014618	You're certain she's unharmed?
FO300014619	You're certain he's unharmed?
FO300014620	Good work, soldier. Make sure the G.E.C.K. is secured aboard my Vertibird.
FO300014621	Objective is secured sir.
FO300014622	No. I'm not doing anything else for you.
FO300014623	Then once again we find ourselves at an impasse. How disappointing.
FO300014624	If you're in charge, get me the hell out of here!
FO300014625	Ha ha. You're not really in a position to be demanding anything, are you?
FO300014626	Still, you've proven amusing thus far. Let's see if you can keep it up.
FO300014627	Isn't it obvious by now? You've only been here a short while and you're already doing just as I ask.
FO300014628	And now we come to your next game. Succeed, and there may be something in it for you.
FO300014629	What kind of benefits?
FO300014630	Ah ah ah! That's another question, and you've already had your answer for now.
FO300014631	If you want more, you'll have to prove you're worth my time. Continue to amuse me, and I may answer more questions.
FO300014632	What do I have to do to see him?
FO300014633	Ahhh, now that is just the sort of question you should be asking.
FO300014634	You understand that I am in control, then. Excellent. You are far more promising than your father.
FO300014635	What have you done to him?
FO300014636	Were I you, I'd be more concerned with myself at the moment.
FO300014637	And besides, we're done with questions for now. Perhaps we'll address it at a later time. First, I have something else for you to do.
FO300014638	I want to see him. Now!
FO300014639	Hmm. No, no I don't think so.
FO300014640	We haven't yet plumbed the depths of your ability to amuse me. I think you'll do a few more things for me first.
FO300014641	You're safe up here in your fortress. What do you know about fighting?
FO300014642	You've got to understand! If I die, so does the voice of the people! I can't take that risk.
FO300014643	Your idea of saving the world means combing through the rubble and using a gun. I use my voice. We're two sides of the same coin.
FO300014644	If you think always being a target of your enemies is "safe," then you got a funny way of looking at things.
FO300014645	Why bother operating Galaxy News Radio?
FO300014646	Why candy-coat the news when the world is in danger?
FO300014647	People like the Enclave would have you believe everything is calm and totally under control. They're lying.
FO300014648	Hell, President Eden goes around spreading peace, love and government, but no one even knows how old that Enclave signal really is.
FO300014649	People need to hear the truth. It's a harsh world. We've got to work together to make it better. Not wait for Uncle Sam to ride in and save the day.
FO300014650	Why candy-coat the news when the world is in danger?
FO300014651	And now that we know the Enclave isn't a figment of everyone's imagination, my work is even more important.
FO300014652	People need to know the truth about President Eden and his goons. Those fascists won't stop until they control every last one of us.
FO300014653	Why is Galaxy News Radio so important?
FO300014654	You're out of your goddamn mind. You know that, right?
FO300014655	Oh, come now. Would you court death so brazenly?
FO300014656	I suggest you think twice before insulting me again. Now, there are things for you to do.
FO300014657	If you're in control here, can you please help me?
FO300014658	But I am helping you!
FO300014659	Why the hell would you want to look like a little girl?
FO300014660	Why not? I have been in this place for two hundred years. This is something to keep me amused.
FO300014661	Much like my willingness to entertain your questions. Though now I grow bored, so I think I shall set you to a new task.
FO300014662	What do you want me to do?
FO300014663	Pay a visit to the Rockwells. They're very happily married, and I'd like you to change that.
FO300014664	Put an end to their marriage, and we'll talk.
FO300014665	That's all I needed.
FO300014666	Very well.
FO300014667	Certainly.
FO300014668	Let me know if you need something else.
FO300014669	What Order are you a part of?
FO300014670	Actually, I am proctor of the Order of the Quill. I oversee the Archives and Library here in the Citadel.
FO300014671	We are dedicated to preserving the history of the Brotherhood as well as unearthing the secrets of the pre-war civilizations.
FO300014672	We have a single field associate: Scribe Yearling. She operates out of the former Library of Congress to the northeast.
FO300014673	Sword! Of course! Weapons, my boy! You name it, I've helped someone kill it.
FO300014674	Let me guess. You belong the Order of the...
FO300014675	Sword! Of course! Weapons, my girl! You name it, I've helped someone kill it.
FO300014676	Let me guess. You belong the Order of the...
FO300014677	I am Proctor of the Order of the Shield. I oversee the others in my Order, and make sure our defenses are up to snuff.
FO300014678	Do you know how long it took to fortify these ruins? From the husk of the Pentagon I carved a grand Citadel! No easy task, my friend!
FO300014679	Which Order do you serve, Squire Bowditch?
FO300014680	What are the Orders?
FO300014681	The Order of the Quill preserves the written knowledge of the ancients, seeking out all manner of books and holotapes.
FO300014682	Order of the Sword, Order of the Shield, Order of the Quill. Weapons, defenses, and research. Respectively.
FO300014683	Of course. There's the Order of the Sword, Order of the Shield, and Order of the Quill.
FO300014684	The Order of the Sword develops and maintains the Brotherhood's weapons. The Order of the Shield does the same for our Power Armor and defenses.
FO300014685	The Order of the Quill is responsible for recovering and preserving knowledge, ancient and otherwise.
FO300014686	Could you name the Orders?
FO300014687	What do you Scribes do?
FO300014688	Why, a great many things!
FO300014689	There are three Orders within the Scribes, you see. Each dedicated to a different field of study.
FO300014690	Indeed I can!
FO300014691	Pay no heed to those headstrong Knights, with their pop guns and bravado.
FO300014692	It is the Scribes, the Scribes who make the Brotherhood what is truly is! The brawn is useless without the brain, hmm? He he he.
FO300014693	Each Order of Scribes is dedicated to a unique field. All equally important. All more important than those dim-witted grunts.
FO300014694	Can you tell me something about the Scribes?
FO300014695	Tell me a little bit about the Scribes.
FO300014696	That's all I need to know.
FO300014697	Very well.
FO300014698	What does the Brotherhood believe?
FO300014699	We believe in technology, in the triumph of the creations of the ancients over the horrors and evils of the Wasteland.
FO300014700	We believe in trust. Trust in technology. Trust in our fellow Brothers. Trust in our Elders.
FO300014701	Ah, and we believe in victory. Our forces have dwindled, but still we fight on. Super Mutant, Enclave, it matters not. Surrender is not an option.
FO300014702	Who are the members of the Brotherhood?
FO300014703	Elder Lyons leads us. Star Paladin Cross is his seneschal. Sentinel Lyons', the Elder's daughter, commands the Lyons' Pride, our elite combat squad.
FO300014704	Scribe Rothchild oversees the Scribes in their duties to seek knowledge and restore the technology the Brotherhood has acquired.
FO300014705	I have some questions about the Brotherhood.
FO300014706	Ah, one of my favorite subjects, of course! What would you like to know?
FO300014707	You want to talk to Scribe Jameson. She's the archivist, not me.
FO300014708	You must see a lot of things. What's been going on?
FO300014709	What's been going on? Well, let's see. For years, we've been draining our resources defending the ungrateful residents of this no man's land.
FO300014710	Most of my best friends have either been ripped apart by Super Mutants or left to join the Outcasts.
FO300014711	And now an enemy we faced more than thirty years ago has resurfaced, and their tech is still better than ours.
FO300014712	What's been going on with you?
FO300014713	That's all I needed.
FO300014714	Very well.
FO300014715	Certainly.
FO300014716	Can you describe the layout of the Citadel?
FO300014717	You are currently in A Ring. Here, you will find the Great Hall, the Lyons' Den, and the Archives.
FO300014718	Beyond this area is B Ring, quarters for the Knights, Scribes, and Elder Lyons.
FO300014719	Outside in the Bailey are the training areas and access to the Initiates' barracks.
FO300014720	Other than that, down those steps is the Lab. Be careful around there, the Scribes are touchy about who goes near their toys.
FO300014721	This is B Ring. Here you'll find the general barracks, sick bay, and Elder Lyons' quarters.
FO300014722	Outside in the Bailey are the training areas and access to the Initiates' barracks.
FO300014723	Other than that, go through A Ring to get to the Lab. The Scribes do most of their work on the projects down there, so watch what you touch.
FO300014724	You are currently in the lab. This area belongs mainly to the Scribes. They do their technological R&D down here.
FO300014725	Up those stairs is A Ring, our main gathering area. The Great Hall is there, as well as the Lyons' Pride quarters and rec room, and the Archives.
FO300014726	Head through A Ring to get to B Ring, general quarters are there, our doc is across the hall from those, and Elder Lyons' quarters are in the back.
FO300014727	Outside in the Bailey are the training areas and access to the Initiates' barracks.
FO300014728	This is the Inner Bailey. These are the training areas and access to the Initiates barracks is across the cut.
FO300014729	Through those doors to the east is A Ring. The great hall is there, as well as the Lyons' Pride quarters and rec room, and the Archives.
FO300014730	Head through A Ring to get to B Ring, general quarters are there, our doc is across the hall from those, and Elder Lyons' quarters are in the back.
FO300014731	The lab is underground. That area belongs mainly to the scribes. They do their technological R&D down there, so watch your step.
FO300014732	I need some supplies. Who would I see about that?
FO300014733	Word came down that you got permission from Elder Lyons to trade, so just head down to the lab and talk to Knight Captain Durga.
FO300014734	Word came down that you got permission from Elder Lyons to trade, so go talk to Knight Captain Durga. She's here in the lab.
FO300014735	Well, any one of us would see Knight Captain Durga down in the lab. But since you're an outsider, you'll need permission from Elder Lyons.
FO300014736	Well, any one of us would see Knight Captain Durga, here in the Lab. But since you're an outsider, you'll need permission from Elder Lyons.
FO300014737	Do you have a medic?
FO300014738	You could say that. We have an old Robo Doc. He's a bit creepy, but he does the job. You'll find him in B Ring.
FO300014739	You could say that. We have an old Robo Doc. He's a bit creepy, but he does the job. He's here in B Ring.
FO300014740	I have a few questions about the Citadel.
FO300014741	What do you need to find?
FO300014742	I can help with that. What do you need?
FO300014743	Escape the Vault? How?
FO300014744	Listen. There's a secret tunnel that leads directly from my father's office to the exit. You'll have to hack the computer in his office to open it.
FO300014745	Use these to get into his office. That's how I always get in.
FO300014746	Come on, your dad did it. And he didn't even have my help.
FO300014747	It won't be easy, though. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from following your dad.
FO300014748	I need to escape the Vault. And you're going to help me.
FO300014749	That's exactly what I had in mind.
FO300014750	Listen. There's a secret tunnel that leads directly from my father's office to the exit. You'll have to hack the computer in his office to open it.
FO300014751	Use these to get into his office. That's how I always get in.
FO300014752	That's exactly what I had in mind.
FO300014753	It won't be easy, though. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from following your dad.
FO300014754	Oh, so you don't trust me now? Thanks a lot. You think it was easy for me to get here? With the Radroaches and security all over the place?
FO300014755	You're the Overseer's daughter! Can't you fix this?
FO300014756	But that doesn't matter. I can take care of myself. It's you he's looking for.
FO300014757	And I have a plan. I know how to get you out of the Vault. Well, I think it will work.
FO300014758	Fine. Escape first, payback later.
FO300014759	Good. You're finally talking sense.
FO300014760	My God, this is all so crazy. I can't believe your dad didn't tell you he was leaving.
FO300014761	I've heard enough. I'm going to make them pay.
FO300014762	Don't be an idiot! What are you going to do, fight the whole security force by yourself?
FO300014763	No, I've thought about it. There's only one way. You have to follow your dad. You have to leave the Vault.
FO300014764	You're right. I can't stay here. But where can I go?
FO300014765	I'm sorry, but I think you'll have to follow your dad. You'll have to escape from the Vault.
FO300014766	If you want me to find Ian, I'll need to equip myself. That costs money.
FO300014767	Fine. Fine. Here, this is all I have left to feed myself, you selfish asshole!
FO300014768	I don't care anymore. I just want to know where my brother is.
FO300014769	That's all I have in the world I told you!
FO300014770	Sorry. I agreed to go to Arefu. That's it.
FO300014771	Fine. Be an asshole. I don't care.
FO300014772	If you find Ian, and you have a change of heart, come back here and tell me. If not, fine! Screw you!
FO300014773	All right, Lucy. Calm down. I'll find Ian.
FO300014774	I'm sorry. You don't even know me, and you've already helped this much.
FO300014775	I'm not stupid, I know he's probably dead. I just need to know for sure.
FO300014776	There's no sign of him, but I'm sure he's alive.
FO300014777	You must find him! Please! He's all I have left in this world now.
FO300014778	I just gotta know if he's alive or dead. It can't just end this way!
FO300014779	Ha! That's it? No problem.
FO300014780	Excellent. I so enjoy that "can-do" spirit.
FO300014781	No, I won't do that to them.
FO300014782	Then I'm afraid we have nothing more to say to one another.
FO300014783	Fine, but it's only because I want more answers from you.
FO300014784	Rationalize it any way you'd like. If you succeed, we'll continue our discussion.
FO300014785	Hey, maybe you should mind your own business.
FO300014786	Why, I never!
FO300014787	You're the one who asked ME about it, you little brat!
FO300014788	Hey, thanks for the tip.
FO300014789	Tip? Oh, I wouldn't call it that. Just something I heard, is all.
FO300014790	So they've had some problems in the past?
FO300014791	Well sure, sweetie. Doesn't everyone?
FO300014792	Martha Simpson must've been mortified, hearing Janet call her all those names. She's never said one word about it, though.
FO300014793	What do you mean, "worked everything out"?
FO300014794	Janet thought there was something going on with Roger and Martha Simpson. He eventually convinced her it wasn't true.
FO300014795	But I've seen the way Martha looks at him. Janet may believe him, but I sure don't.
FO300014796	Betty wants me to break up your marriage.
FO300014797	What? Now that's a ridiculous thing to say. You kids need to find some different games to play!
FO300014798	Now that's not funny. Not one bit.
FO300014799	Oh, come on. You know something, don't you? What's the story?
FO300014800	But Roger pushed me away. Tried to deny it. Even Janet knew it was there. She fought with him over it.
FO300014801	I think she still suspects something. I try to stay away from Roger, just to avoid giving her a reason to hate me more.
FO300014802	Okay, if you say so.
FO300014803	People around here should mind their own business.
FO300014804	Spill it, Amata. How do I get to the exit?
FO300014805	Lucky for you, I know another way through. There's a secret tunnel that runs from the Overseer's Office to the Vault door!
FO300014806	Security doesn't even know about it. Nobody except my father -- and me.  "One of the Overseer's secrets," he says.
FO300014807	Lucky for you, I know of another way in.
FO300014808	There's a secret tunnel that runs from the Overseer's Office to the Vault door!
FO300014809	Security doesn't even know about it. Nobody except my father -- and me.  "One of the Overseer's secrets," he says.
FO300014810	Nothing. I just wanted to see if you were still waiting for me to come back.
FO300014811	I don't even know why I bother with you.
FO300014812	I may have been a little hasty earlier. I'm ready to hear your plan.
FO300014813	Not exactly an apology, but probably the best I can expect.
FO300014814	You'd better listen, because you'll never escape without my help.
FO300014815	There's a secret tunnel that leads directly from my father's office to the exit. You'll have to hack the computer in his office to open it.
FO300014816	Use these to get into his office. That's how I always get in.
FO300014817	Not exactly an apology, but probably the best I can expect.
FO300014818	You'd better listen, because you'll never escape without my help.
FO300014819	It won't be easy. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from following your dad.
FO300014820	I was wrong. I'm sorry. I do need your help.
FO300014821	Was that an actual apology? From you? Wow. You must really be desperate.
FO300014822	You're right though. You do need my help. You'll never get out of here on your own. You're lucky I'm such a good friend.
FO300014823	There's a secret tunnel that leads directly from my father's office to the exit. You'll have to hack the computer in his office to open it.
FO300014824	Use these to get into his office. That's how I always get in.
FO300014825	Was that an actual apology? From you? Wow. You must really be desperate.
FO300014826	You're right though. You do need my help. You'll never get out of here on your own. You're lucky I'm such a good friend.
FO300014827	It won't be easy. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from following your dad.
FO300014828	Lights out? Radroaches? Maybe you'd better tell me more about what's going on.
FO300014829	Your sense of self-preservation never fails to rise to the surface.
FO300014830	Lucky for you, I have a plan. I can help you follow your dad and escape from the Vault!
FO300014831	Whatever. In any case, I don't need any more of your "help."
FO300014832	Fine! You're on your own, then. I'll wait here and see how long until you come crawling back, begging for my help.
FO300014833	Sorry, Amata. I do trust you. It's just a lot to take in.
FO300014834	I understand. It must be rough, waking up suddenly to find your dad gone and everything turned upside down.
FO300014835	Dad didn't need your help, and neither do I.
FO300014836	Fine. I can't stop you. You don't deserve it, but I'll wait here so when you change your mind you'll know where to find me.
FO300014837	Good. Now will you shut up and listen to me for a second?
FO300014838	There's a secret tunnel that leads directly from my father's office to the exit. You'll have to hack the computer in his office to open it.
FO300014839	Use these to get into his office. That's how I always get in.
FO300014840	You're such a jerk. Maybe I don't want to help you anymore.
FO300014841	No, don't worry. If I got sore that easily we couldn't have stayed friends all these years. You being such a jerk and all.
FO300014842	Listen. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from escaping.
FO300014843	I don't need help from anyone. Especially not from the Overseer's daughter.
FO300014844	Fine. Be that way. Good luck with the whole Vault in lockdown, Radroaches everywhere, and security guarding every door.
FO300014845	I'm sure you'll have no trouble escaping on your own.
FO300014846	I don't have time to explain everything. You're just going to have to trust me this time.
FO300014847	Listen. There's a secret tunnel that leads directly from my father's office to the exit. You'll have to hack the computer in his office to open it.
FO300014848	Use these to get into his office. That's how I always get in.
FO300014849	Come on, be serious. This will work. It has to.
FO300014850	Listen. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from escaping.
FO300014851	You're right. It's none of your business.
FO300014852	I'm sorry I asked. And I'm not just saying that -- I shouldn't have pried.
FO300014853	But it doesn't matter. I can help you escape. I have my own plan!
FO300014854	Of course he did! My dad tells me everything. <Lie.>
FO300014855	Uh, okay. Sure.
FO300014856	But it doesn't matter. I can help you escape. I have my own plan!
FO300014857	No, I had no idea he was planning to leave.
FO300014858	Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sure he had his reasons. Maybe Jonas was supposed to explain everything to you?
FO300014859	But it doesn't matter. I can help you escape. I have my own plan!
FO300014860	I just have to break into the most heavily guarded place in the Vault? That it?
FO300014861	If you have a better plan, let's hear it! Look, I know for a fact that the office isn't guarded -- everyone's out looking for you.
FO300014862	Here, you'll probably need these to pick the lock on the office door. They've always worked for me.
FO300014863	Oh, one more thing. I stole my father's pistol. I hope you won't need it, but you'd better take it just in case.
FO300014864	I'll be keeping my father from catching you hacking into his computer.
FO300014865	Here, you'll probably need these to pick the lock on the office door. They've always worked for me.
FO300014866	Oh, one more thing. I stole my father's pistol. I hope you won't need it, but you'd better take it just in case.
FO300014867	I don't have a password to his computer, so you'll have to hack it. But that shouldn't give you any trouble.
FO300014868	I'll find my father and make sure he doesn't go back to his office. But you'd better hurry.
FO300014869	Oh, one more thing. I stole my father's pistol. I hope you won't need it, but you'd better take it just in case.
FO300014870	I don't have a password to his computer, so you'll either have to hack it or find the password somewhere in his desk.
FO300014871	I'll find my father and make sure he doesn't go back to his office. But you'd better hurry.
FO300014872	Oh, one more thing. I stole my father's pistol. I hope you won't need it, but you'd better take it just in case.
FO300014873	Sure am. Stopped in to find something to do.
FO300014874	I hope by "something to do" you mean a job, otherwise you want to talk with Nova.
FO300014875	I'm looking for someone to make a delivery. Interested?
FO300014876	No. I said I wouldn't do it, and I meant it.
FO300014877	Well then, we have little else to say to one another.
FO300014878	Fine, I'll do it.
FO300014879	I'm glad you've chosen to be cooperative.
FO300014880	I don't really have a choice, do I?
FO300014881	There's always a choice. Sometimes it's just easier to make.

FO300014901	So, what's your real name?
FO300014902	Nice try, though.
FO300014903	Haven't we been through this already?
FO300014904	What do you think of Knight Captain Gallows?
FO300014905	I heard that you found out about his real name. Interesting. I wouldn't expect that he'd just tell an outsider something like that.
FO300014906	But he's a good soldier, there's no doubt. I did hear that they have a betting pool about his real name, though.
FO300014907	He's a good man. The other members of the Pride don't seem to trust him. He's quiet, he doesn't horse around with them, and he keeps to himself.
FO300014908	But he's a good soldier, there's no doubt. I did hear that they have a betting pool about his real name, though.
FO300014909	What do you think about Gallows?
FO300014910	I don't trust him. I know, I know, I should take faith in my brother, but he disappears for days out into the Wastes.
FO300014911	He comes back without a word. He only reports to Sentinel Lyons, and doesn't tell the rest of us what he's up to. I can't trust a soldier like that.
FO300014912	No one knows his name?
FO300014913	Nope. No one knows his name, where he comes from -- nothin'. He's a mean little bastard for sure.
FO300014914	He'd be a Paladin by now for sure, except that he ain't got no interest in leadin'. Only killin'. I'm just glad he's on our side.
FO300014915	What's the pool up to?
FO300014916	It's gotta be, what? 2000 caps now? Boy's a mystery, no doubt about it.
FO300014917	If you can figure out his real name, the money's all yours.
FO300014918	What's the story with Gallows?
FO300014919	Really? You're kidding me. What is it?
FO300014920	I know Gallows' real name.
FO300014921	You figure out his name yet? Haha! Yeah, I thought not.
FO300014922	I want to talk about Gallows.
FO300014923	Oh man, there's something wrong with that boy. Ain't nobody around here that even knows his real name.
FO300014924	We got a betting pool in the pride, whole pot goes to the first person who can find out his real name.
FO300014925	What's with that Gallows guy?
FO300014926	Gallows? He's not a bad guy, truth be told. He just doesn't talk much, and if it ain't soldierin', that boy has no time for it.
FO300014927	There's even a betting pool on who can find out his real name. Talk to Glade about it. He'll tell you.
FO300014928	The hell with working this out. I'm sick of you. I'm staying at Mabel's tonight. Don't talk to me. Don't even look at me.
FO300014929	I have no idea what you're talking about Janet. Just calm down, and let's work this out.
FO300014930	You left her underwear on your goddamn desk, Roger. How stupid do you think I am?
FO300014931	Janet, what are you talking about?
FO300014932	You just couldn't stay away from her, could you? And what, you didn't think I'd find out? You disgust me!
FO300014933	What? What did I do?
FO300014934	Roger, you son of a bitch!
FO300014935	Who else is around town?
FO300014936	I don't talk to most of them. Billy says that I have to be careful, even when people seem nice. And I'm especially not allowed to talk to Mr. Jericho.
FO300014937	I usually play with Harden most days, when his dad isn't taking him out to learn to shoot or something.
FO300014938	Billy says that he's going to teach me to shoot one day too!
FO300014939	There's the Stahls. They run the Brass Lantern. I go there to eat with my dad sometimes. Doc Church runs the clinic.
FO300014940	The Confessor is a little weird. But him and mother Maya are always nice to me.
FO300014941	There's also Moriarty, but dad says that I'm not allowed to talk to him.
FO300014942	Do you know any good secrets?
FO300014943	Just make sure that you put everything back if you take anything out to play with it. I don't want to get in trouble.
FO300014944	What do you think of Megaton?
FO300014945	It's great! My dad says that one day, I'm gonna get to be sheriff, just like him!
FO300014946	Who takes care of you?
FO300014947	My dad, of course. He teaches me to shoot, and about the law, and keeping people safe. When he's not busy protecting the town, that is.
FO300014948	MegatonSettlerTalkBYE
FO300014949	Talk to you later.
FO300014950	Have a good one.
FO300014951	Catch you later.
FO300014952	Bye.
FO300014953	Peace be with you.
FO300014954	Later.
FO300014955	MegatonSettlerTalk4
FO300014956	Well, I guess I should stop gossiping and do something productive. Talk to you later.
FO300014957	If I hear anything else, I'll be sure and let you know. See ya.
FO300014958	Ahhh, life here in Megaton, huh? But anyway. I'll talk to you later.
FO300014959	Sometimes, I really wonder about this place. But hey, I'll talk to you later.
FO300014960	Listen, I'm gonna go grab some shuteye.
FO300014961	I was just on my way to grab a bite though -- I'll catch you later.
FO300014962	What are you going to do, huh? Anyway, I should get going. Take care.
FO300014963	You know me, I love to hear myself talk. Anyway, I need to take off.
FO300014964	If I hear anything else, I'll be sure and let you know. See ya.
FO300014965	*Sigh* Anywaaayyy. I don't want to hold you up. Have a good one, all right?
FO300014966	It's funny, though. At the end of the day, I still can't think of any other place I'd rather live. Well, I'll talk to you later.
FO300014967	Heh. It's all so sad, you have to laugh. Know what I'm saying? But hey, you have a good day, all right?
FO300014968	*Sigh* It's one thing after another in this place, isn't it? Anyway, I should get going.
FO300014969	MegatonSettlerTalk3
FO300014970	I hear what you're saying.
FO300014971	Seriously.
FO300014972	Yeah, I know.
FO300014973	I wish you were joking.
FO300014974	Nothing about this place surprises me anymore.
FO300014975	It's all just more of the same in this town, right?
FO300014976	You know, I thought about moving once. Setting myself up in Rivet City or one of the smaller settlements. But hey, this place is home.
FO300014977	No kidding, huh?
FO300014978	Hmmm.
FO300014979	Hm hmm.
FO300014980	MegatonSettlerTalk2
FO300014981	I heard the sheriff talking about defusing the bomb. I don't know. The damn thing's been sitting there so long it's probably harmless. Right?
FO300014982	Stockholm says he saw some more Raiders, off to the east. Good thing for us there's nothing in Megaton worth raiding.
FO300014983	You ever see a Yao Guai? Boy, those things are nasty.
FO300014984	Sometimes that Deputy Steel makes me nervous. Simms and his boy, they treat him like a person. But it's just a machine, and machines can malfunction.
FO300014985	Megaton needs a stronger defense force. Okay, there's Simms and Steel, and the town militia, but half of us can't even aim straight.
FO300014986	Those guys from the church drink the water near the bomb because they WANT to. Believes it makes them "closer to Atom" or something. Idiots.
FO300014987	You know, I'm getting a little sick of living in the slums. They promised me that after a few months I could move into the town.
FO300014988	I don't think that I'm ever going to be able to get a house here. I've asked Simms a dozen times and he keeps saying the same thing.
FO300014989	Have you ever talked to that Jericho guy? Man, what an asshole.
FO300014990	Did you see Leo Stahl sneak up to the water processing plant last night? What does he do up there? And why does Walter let him in?
FO300014991	I heard that there are Raiders gathering to the west. Do you think they're planning an attack?
FO300014992	You asked where the parts came from to build the town? I heard that there used to be an air station somewhere around here before the war.
FO300014993	You should talk to the older folks about what Megaton was like before they built the walls. You think it's dangerous now?
FO300014994	I was rooting around in Springvale the other day and guess what I found: a book! An actual book! Can you believe it?
FO300014995	Do you ever question the wisdom in hanging around an atomic bomb all day? I mean, if it was going to blow, it probably would have by now. But still.
FO300014996	God, that Jericho guy gives me the creeps. He's such a nutjob.
FO300014997	Did you hear about the Enclave? Nathan said they're really the U.S. government. He says that they're coming to help us.
FO300014998	Walter sure is a grumpy old bastard. But he keeps that crusty old plant running, so I guess we have no choice but to put up with him.
FO300014999	I swear to God, Moira's crazy. She sold me this thing the other day, I didn't even know what the hell it was. Damn good saleswoman though. Damn good.
FO300015000	Did you hear about Nathan? Yeah, he went and got himself killed. Manya is beside herself.
FO300015001	Nathan just hasn't been the same since Manya died. He refuses to leave the house!
FO300015002	Ever since Sheriff Simms died, this place hasn't been the same. There's a fight nearly every night up at Moriarty's!
FO300015003	Have you been to the Brass Lantern lately? That place is like a funeral home since Jenny died.
FO300015004	The Stahl family is still mourning Leo. Nice kid, but I hear that he was mixed up in some bad shit.
FO300015005	Did you hear that the Stahls lost their older brother? He kept that place running, you know. It'll probably fall apart without him.
FO300015006	What do you suppose will happen to the Brass Lantern? With the whole family dead, someone's sure to buy it up.
FO300015007	You know what I miss most? Jenny's noodles. And she was such a sweet girl.
FO300015008	It's about time that someone gave that bastard Moriarty what he deserved, but I can't believe he left the bar to Gob!
FO300015009	God damn, I can't believe that someone killed Moira. Some people will do anything to survive out here, won't they?
FO300015010	With Walter dead, we're screwed. No one else can keep that treatment plant running.
FO300015011	Sorry, not now.
FO300015012	Can't talk now.
FO300015013	We'll catch up later.
FO300015014	MegatonSettlerTalk1
FO300015015	Is there anything interesting going on around here?
FO300015016	A cap for your thoughts.
FO300015017	Anything been going on with you?
FO300015018	You look like you have something on your mind.
FO300015019	What are you thinking?
FO300015020	So, what's up?
FO300015021	You get around, right? What have you heard?
FO300015022	You know, there has to be something going on around here.
FO300015023	Something on your mind?
FO300015024	What's been going on?
FO300015025	Hey. How's it going?
FO300015026	MegatonWhatsUpResponse
FO300015027	Can't say that there's much going on.
FO300015028	Nada.
FO300015029	Not much.
FO300015030	Nothing. We'll talk later.
FO300015031	Been better.
FO300015032	Can't complain.

FO300015060	Oh! Hi!
FO300015061	What's up?
FO300015062	Look, I told you people: I'm busy. Leave me alone.
FO300015063	Irving! God! Can't a woman get a little time to herself!?
FO300015064	DialogueTenpennyDashwoodSneakStartTopic
FO300015065	I'm bored. Let's see if I can lighten things up around here.
FO300015066	It's time to earn mamma some sugar.
FO300015067	I do hope she gets here soon. I'm particularly randy this evening.
FO300015068	It's play time. I wonder if we will play doctor and nurse again?
FO300015069	Another evening with Ms. Lancaster. That girl certainly knows how to have a good time!
FO300015070	SHE never yells at me. SHE appreciates me. Unlike some people.
FO300015071	I'm plum puckered out.
FO300015072	Time to get some beauty rest!
FO300015073	Well, there's another day done.
FO300015074	Early to bed, early to rise.
FO300015075	I'm exhausted. It's time for some shut-eye.
FO300015076	Off to dreamland I go. Ta-ta!
FO300015077	I'm tired. I'm going to bed.
FO300015078	Whew! I'm sleepy. Time to hit the pillows!
FO300015079	I think I'll turn in for the night.
FO300015080	Well. I better go pass out for a while.
FO300015081	It's time for bed. Goodnight.
FO300015082	<Yawn> I'm off to bed. Sweet dreams!
FO300015083	I'm tired as hell.
FO300015084	I'm positively famished. I must get something to eat before I pass out!
FO300015085	Time for a snack.
FO300015086	Time to take five.
FO300015087	Mmm. I think I'll go grab a bite to eat.
FO300015088	Dinner time.
FO300015089	I think I'll go scrounge up a little something to eat.
FO300015090	I'm hungry.
FO300015091	It's time for a little bite of something delicious.
FO300015092	Think I'll take a moment for myself, and eat a little something.
FO300015093	My stomach is growling at me.
FO300015094	Din din! Time to eat!
FO300015095	I'm starving!
FO300015096	Well. I guess I better get some food.
FO300015097	You think that's funny? Elder Lyons is a great man who risked a lot for the Wastes.
FO300015098	That's pretty amazing, Kodiak.
FO300015099	That's awful! How could the Brotherhood do that?
FO300015100	Normally, that would get you a crack across the jaw. But since you didn't know what the Pitt was like, I'll let it go.
FO300015101	I still have nightmares about the place. Thirty years and how many horrors later, and the Pitt is still the worst thing I've ever seen.
FO300015102	It was ugly work, sure. Questionably moral? No doubt. But there was no other choice. That city had to go.
FO300015103	What happened to the other kids from the Pitt?
FO300015104	All of 'em became Initiates. Most of them went on to become Brothers. A lot fell in action.
FO300015105	I'm the only survivor of the Scourge of the Pitt still stationed at the Citadel.
FO300015106	What happened to your parents?
FO300015107	Hell if I know. I never knew them. I lived on the street and fought with rats for food.
FO300015108	How did you end up back here?
FO300015109	Elder Lyons brought us all back to the Citadel. He said it was the safest place he knew of. This place was still being converted.
FO300015110	He put us in as Initiates and kept a watchful eye over us. He was tough, but he taught us to stay alive. The man is like a father to me.
FO300015111	That was before I knew how boring it was.
FO300015112	Then you don't have to hear it. The hell with you.
FO300015113	Huh? I'm sorry, are you still talking?
FO300015114	Hey, you wanted to hear it.
FO300015115	What made them so terrible?
FO300015116	The rivers. Even after the war, they were still flowing, but irradiated, and filled with God knows what else.
FO300015117	How did you escape?
FO300015118	As they swept through, the Brotherhood policed up every non-mutie child they could find. Turns out, there weren't that many.
FO300015119	Me and maybe twenty others. The younger we were, the less of a chance that we were mutated. It was ugly work, no doubt, but it had to be done.
FO300015120	I'll never forget the sight of the Brotherhood of Steel breaching the breast of the mountain at dawn.
FO300015121	I'm looking for runaway slaves.
FO300015122	We've got slavers! Grab your guns!
FO300015123	Sounds like a nice place. You should go back.
FO300015124	What was the Scourge?
FO300015125	It was a Brotherhood operation. They marched in and swept the place clean. Most of the people there were half-mutated, cancerous, vile things.
FO300015126	This was way back, before the Citadel was fortified. Part of the early recon after the Brotherhood first arrived in this area.
FO300015127	One night, a squad of Brothers led by Paladin Lyons swept into the city from over Mount Wash, tearing apart anyone who stood against them.
FO300015128	They were completely outnumbered. And still they razed that place to the ground.
FO300015129	How did you end up in the Brotherhood?
FO300015130	Oh, now you want story time? Sorry. I'm not havin' it.
FO300015131	But the Brotherhood of Steel came down on the place with a righteous hammer. They called it "The Scourge."
FO300015132	You're in luck! I think I may already have what you're looking for.
FO300015133	Sakes alive! You mean you found a violin?
FO300015134	Let's make it 300 caps and you have a deal.
FO300015135	Well, it would bring more people in here if I had it on display I suppose.
FO300015136	All right. You got it. 300 caps.
FO300015137	Well, it would bring more people in here if I had it on display I suppose.
FO300015138	All right. You got it. 300 caps.
FO300015139	Actually, let me think about it.
FO300015140	Fine. You approached me you know. Thanks for the time Waster.
FO300015141	Sure, 200 caps sounds good.
FO300015142	Here you go.
FO300015143	This is the most I ever paid for a hunk of wood and strings, but what the hell.
FO300015144	Here you go.
FO300015145	This is the most I ever paid for a hunk of wood and strings, but what the hell.
FO300015146	Some culture would be good for you, Ghoul.
FO300015147	One snap of my finger and I could fill you with enough holes to cut your weight in half.
FO300015148	Testing my temper is not a good idea. Now buy something or get out of here.
FO300015149	One of a kind, huh? I like the sound of that.
FO300015150	Yeah? Wonderful. The corns on my feet from standing in this joint all day long are artifacts too.
FO300015151	Why don't you stop wasting my time and buy something or get out of here.
FO300015152	You fucking coward. I can't stand the sight of you. Get away from me!
FO300015153	Who told you that? They're lying, I swear it!
FO300015154	Well someone saw you and Martha, Roger, and I heard about it. So now I know for sure.
FO300015155	Janet, what the hell are you talking about?
FO300015156	Don't you lie to me. Did you honestly think you could skulk around with that whore and no one would see you?
FO300015157	What? Janet, what are you talking about?
FO300015158	Roger, you son of a bitch. Did you really think I wouldn't find out?
FO300015159	Can you repair something for me?
FO300015160	Oh boy! New junk to tinker with!
FO300015161	Sure, let me see that thing!
FO300015162	Can you repair something for me?
FO300015163	Let me see if I can't hammer this garbage into shape.
FO300015164	Whatever you've got, I've got just the thing to fix it.
FO300015165	We used to have a better mechanic, but that didn't work out so well. I'll see what I can do.
FO300015166	I can give it a look, sure.
FO300015167	I'll see what I can do.
FO300015168	Easy. I've got a knack for this sort of thing, you know!
FO300015169	I'll see if I can't take a whack at it.
FO300015170	For a price, sure.
FO300015171	Let's take a look and see.
FO300015172	Yes, but only if it wants to be repaired.
FO300015173	Maybe. Let's take a look.
FO300015174	I hate to break it to you, but I saw your husband kissing some other woman.
FO300015175	It's that Martha Simpson, isn't it? I knew it! That's it. I've had enough of Roger's lies and bullshit!
FO300015176	What is that stone head?
FO300015177	He is the Great Emancipator. He freed all the slaves over a hundred years before the bombs dropped.
FO300015178	Hannibal wants to make his Memorial a symbol of hope and freedom for all slaves.
FO300015179	That's Lincoln, sir. Hannibal found it. He wants to put it back, sir. I don't really understand why.
FO300015180	That's Lincoln, ma'am. Hannibal found it. He wants to put it back, ma'am. I don't really understand why.
FO300015181	The stone head is from the statue of Abraham Lincoln. Hannibal wants me to reattach it to the statue in the Memorial.
FO300015182	Haven't you been listening? That's Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator.
FO300015183	That's Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator. We don't know how it came to be here, but it's fitting, don't you think?
FO300015184	God damn rookie. That's Lincoln. He freed some slaves a long time ago.
FO300015185	If you want to know more, come listen to Hannibal give his speech. He does it right after the noon meal.
FO300015186	I'll bet you know where I can find one.
FO300015187	Yes. There might be one in the Museum of History. Alejandra says they have a special exhibit all about Lincoln.
FO300015188	Where the hell am I supposed to get a picture of the Memorial?
FO300015189	Our ancestors honored Lincoln's life with a display in the Museum of History. I'm hoping that a picture of the Memorial still survives in there.
FO300015190	So you are a coward. I thought so.
FO300015191	Not until I say so. I've got a few questions you're going to have to answer first.
FO300015192	What do you know about the Temple of the Union?
FO300015193	Nope. Not really. I think I'll just be on my way.
FO300015194	Hannibal says you need something?
FO300015195	Hannibal told you about Lincoln's Memorial?
FO300015196	Well, he doesn't just want to live there. He also wants to restore it. Make it so people tell stories about it and the word can get to the slaves.
FO300015197	But I can't restore something if I don't know what it looked like. I need a drawing or photograph of it.
FO300015198	He was a stone mason. It will fall to him to restore the Memorial as best he can.
FO300015199	He's been pestering me for weeks now to get him some things he needs. I don't have time to deal with him right now.
FO300015200	What is it that Caleb needs?
FO300015201	Sounds dangerous. Where is this place?
FO300015202	I want to move all my people to the Memorial site for the great Abraham Lincoln, but I need to know if it's safe.
FO300015203	I've heard rumors of Super Mutants infesting that area though. We need to send someone to check that out first.
FO300015204	That's a noble cause, but can I ask you about something else?
FO300015205	What?
FO300015206	I shouldn't have expected anyone that hasn't been a slave to give a damn.
FO300015207	Why don't you let them stay here?
FO300015208	We don't have enough room. There's not enough water or food here.
FO300015209	But I have a plan. A plan to take over a place that will be a shining beacon of hope for all slaves.
FO300015210	What are a bunch of escaped slaves doing holed up here?
FO300015211	We're all runaways. Hannibal wants to make this a place for all escaped slaves, but it's too small.
FO300015212	Why are all of you hiding in this place?
FO300015213	Oh, sir, this place is heaven. Just a little bit of heaven here in the wasteland. Any slave makes it here, he's free. Just like that.
FO300015214	And, Mister Hannibal, he's got a plan. A plan for heaven to be everywhere, not just here.
FO300015215	This place is a dump. Why don't you just leave before the Slavers find you?
FO300015216	Oh, ma'am, this place is heaven. Just a little bit of heaven here in the wasteland. Any slave makes it here, he's free. Just like that.
FO300015217	And, Mister Hannibal, he's got a plan. A plan for heaven to be everywhere, not just here.
FO300015218	This place is a dump. Why don't you just leave before the Slavers find you?
FO300015219	We are the only hope for runaway slaves everywhere.
FO300015220	Rivet City, and the Citadel can't be bothered with helping slaves. They turn a blind eye.
FO300015221	We are the only ones willing to stand against Paradise Falls and slavery.
FO300015222	Why do you stay here? Why not keep running?
FO300015223	We are trying to make a safe haven for all runaway slaves.
FO300015224	We give food and supplies to any that find us, and help them on their way.
FO300015225	This place is the death of all slavers. Maybe someday the death of slavery.
FO300015226	Hannibal has a plan. We're too small right now, but someday we'll be big enough to take them on.
FO300015227	Aren't you afraid the Slavers will find you?
FO300015228	I could get rid of the Super Mutants, if there are any.
FO300015229	Slavers? Dear God. They must know about our plans.
FO300015230	Do whatever you have to do to make the Memorial site safe for my people.
FO300015231	Before you leave, speak with Caleb. He'll need your help too.
FO300015232	Don't worry about the Super Mutants. Slavers are in control of the Memorial.
FO300015233	Soldiers? Slavers more likely. Dear God. They must know about our plans.
FO300015234	Do whatever you have to do to make the Memorial site safe for my people.
FO300015235	Before you leave, speak with Caleb. He'll need your help too.
FO300015236	Don't worry about the Super Mutants. Soldiers are in control of the Memorial.
FO300015237	I was hoping you would help us. The Memorial is easy to find. Good luck.
FO300015238	One other thing. Talk to Caleb. He'll need your help. We can't leave unless he's ready too.
FO300015239	I'll need to think about that.
FO300015240	When you are ready, let me know.
FO300015241	Until then, you are free to wander our home. However, we cannot allow you to leave.
FO300015242	Protect escaped slaves? You've got to be kidding. You're worth money to me!
FO300015243	You leave me no choice.
FO300015244	I'll keep the offer open. If you don't do it, someone else will. Hell, I'll do it if I have to.
FO300015245	One more thing. Stay out of the Memorial. My men will shoot anyone that gets too close.
FO300015246	I've got a lot going on right now. Maybe later.
FO300015247	I solemnly swear to protect the Temple of the Union.
FO300015248	Welcome, brother, to the Temple of the Union!
FO300015249	Our home is your home. Your past is your own affair, so long as you serve our common good.
FO300015250	As a symbol of our trust, here is a key to the gate.
FO300015251	Welcome, sister, to the Temple of the Union!
FO300015252	Our home is your home. Your past is your own affair, so long as you serve our common good.
FO300015253	As a symbol of our trust, here is a key to the gate.
FO300015254	It's a museum, just past the Washington Monument. I'm only interested in stuff related to Abraham Lincoln. Bring me back whatever you find.
FO300015255	Oh, and don't try and go into the Memorial. The guards have orders to shoot on sight.
FO300015256	Okay. Where is this ruin?
FO300015257	CG04GuardExitYell
FO300015258	I'm not crazy enough to go out there!
FO300015259	I'm not going out there, I don't care what the Overseer says.
FO300015260	Quick, close the door!
FO300015261	I did what you wanted. Now you have some explaining to do.
FO300015262	You have amused me thus far, but I still don't think you're quite in a position to be demanding anything.
FO300015263	Still, I suppose you've earned the right to some further answers. What would you ask of me?
FO300015264	Now what?
FO300015265	To the point, aren't we?
FO300015266	I've been having so much fun, I see no reason to stop now. Let's try something new, shall we?
FO300015267	I'd like you to kill Mabel Henderson. Find an interesting way to do it, please. I'm curious to see how creative you can be.
FO300015268	Reilly's Rangers, huh? Never heard of you.
FO300015269	You been stuck living in a vault the last decade or something?
FO300015270	We're guns for hire; the best merc group in the Capital Wasteland. If you need something done in there, you seek us out.
FO300015271	I have to be on my way.
FO300015272	Good luck. You're going to need it.
FO300015273	Please don't go. I really need your help.
FO300015274	I don't cut anyone slack. Deal with it.
FO300015275	Nice that you pick on bed-ridden people. That how you get your jollies? Does it make you feel tough?
FO300015276	If you want to hear me out, then shut the hell up. If not, get out of my face.
FO300015277	Okay, okay. Sorry.
FO300015278	If time wasn't so precious right now, I wouldn't be so on edge either. I need to get help for the rest of the Rangers, and fast.
FO300015279	I don't think you're in any condition to make threats.
FO300015280	Look, I just woke up expecting to see the pearly gates. Can you cut me some slack, or what?
FO300015281	My apologies. I didn't know who you were.
FO300015282	That's okay, kid. Don't sweat it. The Wasteland's a big place.
FO300015283	We're guns for hire; the best merc group in the Capital Wasteland. If you need something done in there, you seek us out.
FO300015284	Get a grip, lady.
FO300015285	Look, asshole. I don't know who you are, but no one talks to Reilly that way. Yeah, you heard me, THE Reilly of Reilly's Rangers.
FO300015286	Whoa, whoa. Calm down! Who are you?
FO300015287	I'm sorry. The name's Reilly. Yeah, THE Reilly as in Reilly's Rangers.
FO300015288	I've got to admit, this is kind of fun. What can I do next?
FO300015289	I'm pleased to see I'm not the only one being entertained. You're far more agreeable than your father.
FO300015290	If you wish for more, then so be it. But let's raise the stakes a bit this time. I'd like you to kill Mabel Henderson.
FO300015291	But do be creative about it. Beating her to death just won't suffice. Put some effort into it.
FO300015292	Let me tell you the story of Abraham Lincoln.
FO300015293	He was born a Tucky Tearsman. The truth of this mysterious title has been lost, but we know it was a great honor.
FO300015294	As a child he could not bear to see any animal chained or imprisoned. He was even known to set free the family Brahmin on occasion.
FO300015295	As a youth, Abraham Lincoln fought Raiders in the war of the black hawks.
FO300015296	When the war ended, he settled down to rule the Linoy, a small tribe of free men.
FO300015297	He grew so famous that one day he was made President. He ruled over all the land.
FO300015298	When he declared that all slaves must be freed, the slavers rebelled against his rule.
FO300015299	They fought a great war, which Lincoln won.
FO300015300	When he came to free the slaves, an assassin of the slavers struck him down.
FO300015301	In the confusion, a few of the slavers escaped. Lincoln's generals hunted them, but could not find them.
FO300015302	The bombs ended the era of Lincoln, but we will resurrect his voice.
FO300015303	We will restore the greatness of his vision where all men are created equal, and all men can live free!
FO300015304	So this is the Lincoln Memorial?
FO300015305	Yeah. Not much to look at anymore. The statue doesn't even have a head.
FO300015306	Hard to tell without a head, huh?
FO300015307	Not for long.
FO300015308	I can't wait to see the Great Emancipator turn into a smoking pile of rubble
FO300015309	It's the Lincoln Memorial. This Lincoln guy supposedly freed all the slaves before the bombs dropped.
FO300015310	So the pussies built a Memorial to him.
FO300015311	It's got our slaves thinking that they can be free too.
FO300015312	What is this place?
FO300015313	Yeah. Just east of here. Bunch of guys with guns are holed up there.
FO300015314	Is the Lincoln Memorial around here somewhere?
FO300015315	Yeah. Just east of here. Some freed slaves just occupied it. We trade with them occasionally.
FO300015316	Is the Lincoln Memorial around here somewhere?
FO300015317	Yeah. Just east of here. Bunch of guys with guns are holed up there.
FO300015318	Is the Lincoln Memorial around here somewhere?
FO300015319	Yeah. Just east of here. Some freed slaves just occupied it. We trade with them occasionally.
FO300015320	Is the Lincoln Memorial around here somewhere?
FO300015321	Why would your father kill Jonas? That makes no sense.
FO300015322	I don't think they meant to. As if that makes any difference.
FO300015323	I think he must have distracted the guards while your dad got into the Vault door controls.
FO300015324	When they realized that Jonas had helped your dad escape, they just lost it. I'm sorry, but I really don't want to think about it again.
FO300015325	I still don't understand how my father escaped. Isn't the Vault door sealed?
FO300015326	Well, that's what they've always told us, but apparently it's not.
FO300015327	From what I overheard, he hacked into the computer that controls the door.
FO300015328	That's why my father locked down the door leading to the exit.
FO300015329	So what happened to the lights?
FO300015330	My father ordered the Vault into lockdown. Everyone's supposed to stay in their quarters and emergency lighting only.
FO300015331	It was lucky for you in a way. Security's been distracted dealing with the Roaches, but that won't last forever. You've got to get moving.
FO300015332	Sounds like fun.
FO300015333	I thought you might find it amusing. It draws upon an old urban legend, a story told over campfires many years ago.
FO300015334	The residents have all heard the story, and will fear you.
FO300015335	Go forth, and make me proud.
FO300015336	Who the hell is the Pint-Sized Slasher?
FO300015337	He is a figure of myth, born of old campfire stories. You will make him a reality.
FO300015338	The residents will know you, and they will fear you. When they have all been eliminated, return to me.
FO300015339	How do I know you're being honest with me?
FO300015340	I think you'll find that I've been quite honest with you thus far. You have no discernable reason to mistrust me.
FO300015341	In the dog house out behind the abandoned home are a mask and knife. Don the mask, and become the Pint-Sized Slasher.
FO300015342	Use the knife to eliminate all the residents of Tranquility Lane.
FO300015343	That sure was fun!
FO300015344	I had the distinct impression you enjoyed yourself. We are alike, you and I.
FO300015345	Now, you asked for the means to leave Tranquility Lane, and so I grant it to you. The door is open.
FO300015346	You are, of course, welcome to stay a bit longer if you like.
FO300015347	I did what you wanted. Now let me out.
FO300015348	Yes, yes. I suppose you've earned the right to do as you like.
FO300015349	I shall miss your company. This has been a simply wonderful time.
FO300015350	The door is now open. Through it, you may return to the real world, and whatever inferior existence you have there.

FO300015352	[crying]
FO300015353	[crying]
FO300015354	[sobbing]
FO300015355	Come on. Let's go see if we can help her.
FO300015356	Sorry, Butch. I've got my own problems to deal with right now.
FO300015357	Please! I know I've always been a jerk towards you. I know it!
FO300015358	Yeah, I'm asking you. So what.
FO300015359	Look, I'm sorry for the way I've always treated you. You know I never meant any of it, right?
FO300015360	But it's my mom. You can't leave her in there with the Radroaches.
FO300015361	MQ02Planetarium03
FO300015362	Please, sit back, relax and free yourself from the bonds of our planet as we take off for the stars! [bzzzzt!]
FO300015363	MQ02Planetarium02
FO300015364	To understand why man is so interested in this unknown expanse of space around our little world, we must take a journey.
FO300015365	MQ02Planetarium01
FO300015366	For as long as history has been recorded, man has had an insatiable hunger for knowledge regarding the universe.
FO300015367	Are you saying you're afraid of the dark?
FO300015368	You gotta help me. She's not going to last much longer in there! Can't you hear her screaming?
FO300015369	Don't worry, Butch. I'll get your mom out of there.
FO300015370	Oh my God, thank you. I didn't know what to do. You're the best!
FO300015371	Don't worry, Butch. I'll get your mom out of there.
FO300015372	She'll never see it coming.
FO300015373	Excellent. I look forward to seeing what you come up with. Remember, creativity is key!
FO300015374	All right, fine. I'll do it.
FO300015375	Music to my ears.
FO300015376	No, I won't do that.
FO300015377	Yes, yes. How very noble of you. You'll change your mind eventually.
FO300015378	I said I wouldn't do that, and I meant it!
FO300015379	Still you resist me, when you know that I have the answers you seek.
FO300015380	Well, I am not going to beg you. You know what I ask of you, and so you know what you must do to retain my favor.
FO300015381	Nothing, never mind.
FO300015382	I see.
FO300015383	Tranquility Lane was designed to be a home away from home. A new way of sustaining life after the apocalypse.
FO300015384	Vault 112 was the prototype; we never had time to build others. As the designer of the simulation, I was given special access.
FO300015385	Everyone else here is only subconsciously aware of the artificial reality around them; their conscious minds accept it as fact.
FO300015386	What did my father want from you?
FO300015387	Your father, frustrating as he was, recognized the significance of some of my previous work.
FO300015388	He came to gather information on it. He was most pleased to be able to ask me directly, but he failed to understand how things work here.
FO300015389	He was unwilling to compromise, to do anything I asked of him. And so our discussions ended.
FO300015390	Where's my father now?
FO300015391	He's here, and he is unharmed. He has merely been rendered unable to bother me.
FO300015392	RiaderTalkShortHelloResposne
FO300015393	Fuck off.
FO300015394	I'm kind of busy here.
FO300015395	Boss is on my ass again. You know how it is.
FO300015396	Bunch of bullshit. I'll tell you about it later.
FO300015397	Two things: Jack and Shit.
FO300015398	Ain't got time to tell you about it.
FO300015399	You know how it is.
FO300015400	Zippo.
FO300015401	Nada.
FO300015402	Not a damn thing.
FO300015403	Nothin' at all.
FO300015404	Nada, man.
FO300015405	That fuckin' sun is giving me a headache.
FO300015406	It's way too early in the morning for this shit.
FO300015407	Air feels all fucked up tonight. I think a storm's comin'.
FO300015408	RaiderTalkUpNorth5
FO300015409	Dumbass rookies, man.
FO300015410	RaiderTalkUpNorth4
FO300015411	No shit. But he wouldn't stop screamin' about "claws of death". We finally got sick of it and put him down.
FO300015412	That's what I said! After a couple hours, we just put a cap in him to get him to shut up.
FO300015413	RaiderTalkUpNorth3
FO300015414	You're shittin' me! Monsters? Hahaha!
FO300015415	Monsters? They probably got their asses handed to 'em by some Wastelanders and ran home like a bunch of pussies.
FO300015416	RaiderTalkUpNorth2
FO300015417	One of 'em came back last night, screamin' about claws and fangs and shit. He said they ran into a bunch of monsters a few miles north of the city.
FO300015418	RaiderTalkUpNorth1
FO300015419	They went up north? Who goes up there? What happened to them?
FO300015420	No, but this sounds like it'll be good.
FO300015421	RaiderTalkDon'tLookAtMe2
FO300015422	Keepin talkin', smartass. I've had about enough of your shit. You'd just best watch your back.
FO300015423	Yeah, yeah. Keep runnin' your mouth, asshole. Keep fuckin' with me, and I'll be your worst nightmare.
FO300015424	Please. I'll look where the fuck I want to look. What are you gonna do about it?
FO300015425	Well you're just so damn pretty that I can't help but stare.
FO300015426	FleeResponse
FO300015427	Get back here, you fucking coward!
FO300015428	Goddamnit!
FO300015429	How are things now that the power's back?
FO300015430	I can't even tell you the love that I'm getting from the Wasteland.
FO300015431	Ever since GNR started singing again, the guys downstairs told me that more people than ever are tuning in.
FO300015432	It's all I ever wanted.
FO300015433	It's amazing. We've always been able to hear GNR, but it's like the station is brand new or something.
FO300015434	Things are back on track. That should throw a kink in the Enclave's work.
FO300015435	You've done a hell of a job. The Wasteland looks a little brighter if you can believe that.
FO300015436	My mistake. I'll just be going.
FO300015437	Good idea.
FO300015438	Smart move. We shoot anyone that tries to get into the Memorial.
FO300015439	I'm just looking for a place to rest, and maybe do some trading.
FO300015440	Hannibal says I gotta let folks like you in, but that don't mean I have to like it.
FO300015441	Keep your hands in sight and don't make any sudden moves.
FO300015442	I'm coming down to open the gate.
FO300015443	Curiosity can get a wastelander killed. I'm going to let you through, but you'll have to talk to Mr. Walker first. Follow me.
FO300015444	Oh, and stay off the Memorial steps. They have orders to shoot anyone that gets too close. The dirt path is safe.
FO300015445	Easy now. I'm just curious about this place. I'm not looking for trouble.
FO300015446	Maybe. How much is it worth to find these slaves for you?
FO300015447	I'm only interested in the leader, Hannibal Hamlin. You find him, and I'll pay you 100 caps.
FO300015448	His trail leads east from Paradise Falls. He's going to try and claim this memorial, so this is the one place I know I can find him.
FO300015449	Don't kill him yourself. Just find out where he's holed up, and I won't have to wait for him.
FO300015450	They're up north, near Old Olney.
FO300015451	Not willing to trade your life for a bunch of runaway slaves, eh?
FO300015452	Well, you've told me what I need to know.
FO300015453	If you're looking for some spare caps, I'm willing to pay for anything you might find having to do with Abraham Lincoln.
FO300015454	I was going to clean out the ruins of the Museum of History looking for them, but now I've got more important business.
FO300015455	If I had, I wouldn't tell you.
FO300015456	You are really starting to piss me off.
FO300015457	Lucky for you I don't have time to give you an attitude adjustment. Just answer one question and you can go.
FO300015458	What do you know about the Temple of the Union?
FO300015459	I haven't seen any slaves recently.
FO300015460	That's too bad.
FO300015461	You know, you seem like the type of wastelander that might be for hire.
FO300015462	I need someone to get some loot out of a nearby ruin. Are you interested?
FO300015463	Not around here, but there is a group of them up north near Old Olney.
FO300015464	They are?
FO300015465	Now, that's just wrong, isn't it? We're from Paradise Falls, and we've been looking for those runaways.
FO300015466	We'll have to go and take care of that little group of rebels. You can come watch if you want.
FO300015467	Whether you do or don't, I'm looking to hire a wastelander for a small job.
FO300015468	I need someone to bring me some items from a nearby ruin. Are you interested?
FO300015469	So I'm a prisoner? I don't think so!
FO300015470	Then I'm just going to have to kill you.
FO300015471	I've got no beef with you. Let me go and I won't say a word.
FO300015472	I really shouldn't, but I'll take you at your word.
FO300015473	If I ever see you around here again, I'll shoot first and loot your body afterward. Now git.
FO300015474	Who are you guys?
FO300015475	We're from Paradise Falls. We're looking for escaped slaves.
FO300015476	Have you seen any?
FO300015477	No, please! I know he's hurt and lied to us, but he's still my father! I just want him to stop keeping us locked up, that's all!
FO300015478	I know I can't stop you, but I know somewhere in there, my father just thinks he's just watching out for us. So, please, please don't hurt him.
FO300015479	I still owe him a lot for that night. Don't expect to see him again.
FO300015480	I put a bullet right between Ted Strayer's eyes. <Lie.>
FO300015481	So, the Ghoul hater got what was coming to him. Good riddance.
FO300015482	Here's your caps. I'll take that key.
FO300015483	Excellent! That will be a lesson for all the Ghoul haters out there.
FO300015484	Here's you payment for the key.
FO300015485	Dukov is dead. I blew his brains out. <Lie>
FO300015486	Serves him right. He won't be spreading lies about Ghouls any more.
FO300015487	I'll take that key, and here are your caps.
FO300015488	Dave's head popped like a zit. <Lie>
FO300015489	Have you got what I want?
FO300015490	Marvelous! My list is growing shorter.
FO300015491	Here's Strayer's key. Shot in the head, just like you asked.
FO300015492	Not much of a shot, eh? I couldn't kill Jeff, but I got his son. That will have to do.
FO300015493	Here's your caps. I'll just take that key.
FO300015494	Here's Strayer's key. He's dead, but not from a shot to the head.
FO300015495	That wasn't the plan. I suppose I have to pay for the key anyway though. Here.
FO300015496	Here's Strayer's key. But I'm afraid he's still alive.
FO300015497	So long as I get that key, I don't care.
FO300015498	Here's your caps.
FO300015499	Here's Strayer's key. But I'm afraid he's still alive
FO300015500	May his soul rot! This is great news.
FO300015501	I'll take that key as a memento. Here, take your caps.
FO300015502	Dukov is dead, with a head shot, and here's his key.
FO300015503	Well, better dead than alive I suppose.
FO300015504	Take your caps. I'll take that key.
FO300015505	Here's Dukov's key. He's dead, but not from a shot to the head.
FO300015506	I thought I told you to kill him? That rat bastard is still alive!
FO300015507	I'll pay for the key, but you really screwed up!
FO300015508	Here's Dukov's key. I got it without killing him.
FO300015509	Who cares? I've got his key. That's all I really want.
FO300015510	Here's Dukov's key. I got it without killing him.
FO300015511	Yes, yes, yes! Another bigot bites the dust.
FO300015512	I'll just take that key, and you can take these caps.
FO300015513	Here's Dave's key. One shot, right through the brain.
FO300015514	Well, at least he's dead.
FO300015515	I suppose I have to pay you anyway since you brought back that key. Here.
FO300015516	Here's Dave's key. He's dead, but not from a shot to the head.
FO300015517	I'll pay you for the key, but I'm very disappointed.
FO300015518	Here's Dave's key, but he's not dead.
FO300015519	Here's Dave's key, but he's not dead.
FO300015520	Tell me where Fort Constantine is.
FO300015521	It's pretty far away, northwest of here. Getting there won't do you any good though, not without those keys.
FO300015522	It's pretty far away, northwest of here. Knowing won't do you any good with these keys though.
FO300015523	What do you have against these guys?
FO300015524	They're Ghoul haters. I want them all dead. Don't you think that's enough?
FO300015525	Are you crazy or something?
FO300015526	Hey that isn't nice! You should apologize right now!
FO300015527	What's the matter with you? Didn't your mom and dad ever teach you any manners?
FO300015528	Are you just completely insane, or what?
FO300015529	You don't like it? Tough!
FO300015530	Humph! Well. I've never been so insulted before!
FO300015531	And to think I was going to offer you the chance of a lifetime. Well, forget it now.
FO300015532	Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.
FO300015533	Let's pretend this never happened and start again.
FO300015534	So, do you want to take the tour?
FO300015535	Born and raised that way and damn proud of it.
FO300015536	Look. I have an offer to give you. You can either stand there and be a pain in the ass, or you can listen to what I have to say.
FO300015537	Hey, she's my girl! Take a number!
FO300015538	I think you'd better calm down and think long and hard about that.
FO300015539	Girdershade is my town, you can't just walk in here and tell me you're taking Sierra.
FO300015540	I'm gonna' be the first one to tap into her goods, not you!
FO300015541	Whoa, that's kind of kinky, I like it! I wouldn't mind watching that.
FO300015542	Sorry baby, you'll just have to take a number. I'm gonna' be the first one to tap into Sierra's goods, not you.
FO300015543	Maybe I like messing around.
FO300015544	Is there anything else interesting to see near Girdershade?
FO300015545	Well, to the east there are some nasty Raiders in Evergreen Mills. I'd stay away from there if I were you.
FO300015546	Luckily, we're kind of hidden here under the old highway, so no one bothers us.
FO300015547	My friend, you are at the ass end of the Capital Wasteland. If it weren't for Sierra I'd be out of here.
FO300015548	One thing I can tell you is stay the hell away from the Dunwich Building to the south. That place is bad mojo.
FO300015549	I dunno what that place is about, but I hear about weird shit going on.
FO300015550	Finally, someone who knows what's going on! How do I get out of here?
FO300015551	We're not really here. We're not really talking. It's all made-up, make-believe. We're sleeping, dreaming.
FO300015552	The dream became a nightmare. It has to end, it just has to. But we're not in charge. He is, and he doesn't want us to wake up.
FO300015553	What are you talking about? You're not making any sense.
FO300015554	This. All this, it's all fake! Made-up, a dream world. Only the dream never ends. I want it to end, for all our sakes.
FO300015555	He keeps us here, so he can laugh and feel good about himself. But I know. I know what he's doing, and I know he uses the Failsafe.
FO300015556	Get away from me, you crazy old bat.
FO300015557	You're the only one who can end it. You must end it, don't you see? You're the only one who can disable the Failsafe!
FO300015558	You broke your sacred promise.
FO300015559	What are you talking about dear? Is everything alright?
FO300015560	I found a love letter. I think you'll want to see it.
FO300015561	He's dead. I'll kill him. And her. They're both dead.
FO300015562	I'd rather keep it.
FO300015563	Don't you dare let any slaves get wind of it.
FO300015564	It'll give them ideas about running.
FO300015565	If they are lost, it will be a great tragedy.
FO300015566	Please, take great care of them.
FO300015567	Very well, but I doubt anyone else will appreciate its value as much as I do.
FO300015568	It's a deal.
FO300015569	I'll get someone to burn this.
FO300015570	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300015571	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300015572	I'll get this burned right away.
FO300015573	We will enshrine this right away.
FO300015574	Thanks much!
FO300015575	You've got a deal. Here you go.
FO300015576	How much will you pay for this poster of the Lincoln Memorial?
FO300015577	I wouldn't want abolishionists to find this. How about 100 caps? You know nobody else will buy it.
FO300015578	Are you interested in buying a recording of Lincoln's voice?
FO300015579	Yeah, I might be interested.
FO300015580	How does 50 caps sound?
FO300015581	His real voice? How is that possible? I must have it.
FO300015582	I'll give you 50 caps for it.
FO300015583	An actual recording of Lincoln's voice? Amazing!
FO300015584	Please, allow me to compensate you for it. I'll pay you 60 caps.
FO300015585	Would you like to make an offer on Lincoln's Rifle?
FO300015586	His rifle you say? Yes, I am interested.
FO300015587	Damn! This thing looks like crap. I'll give you 100 caps for it
FO300015588	His actual rifle? Such a priceless artifact!
FO300015589	You must let me have it. I'll give you 150 caps for it.
FO300015590	I can't believe you have that artifact in your possession! What an amazing addition it would make to the museum.
FO300015591	I will buy it from you for 100 caps. What do you say?
FO300015592	I've found Hannibal Hamlin.
FO300015593	Bravo! I guess I owe you some caps.
FO300015594	I'll gather up the boys and we'll go collect him. You can meet us there if you want.
FO300015595	If I find them, you'll be the first to know.
FO300015596	Perfect. Don't go trying to kill them or capture them yourself. I'll take care of that.
FO300015597	Oh, and stay out of the Memorial. My men have standing orders to shoot anyone that gets too close.
FO300015598	Actually, I already know he's up north, near Old Olney.
FO300015599	Very clever. Well, I guess I owe you some caps.
FO300015600	DemoRobotTopicB
FO300015601	Tickets please.
FO300015602	No entry without tickets. Please present your tickets.
FO300015603	Unauthorized metro use detected.
FO300015604	Hey, whatever. And here I thought you were cute. Guess you're just the same as everyone else here.
FO300015605	Anyway, did you want something or did you just come over here to judge me?
FO300015606	I know! No one understands me either!
FO300015607	God! It's so nice to have someone who understands! I mean, sure, when I left Little Lamplight, I was happy to be out of there.
FO300015608	I was dating Pappy then, you know. I got here and he was all like "Bigtown will be safe", but it wasn't! This place is always under attack!
FO300015609	But I don't date liars, so I dumped his ass and got with Flash. But that didn't last very long. Me and Timebomb were a thing for a while, too.
FO300015610	This seems like a strange thing to worry about right now.
FO300015611	That's what they always say. "Blah blah, Bittercup you need to pay attention when you're on patrol". Like, what, I'm supposed to stop slavers?
FO300015612	I mean, that's Flash's job, not mine. Besides, it doesn't matter, they're going to get us sooner or later.
FO300015613	Back in Lamplight, they always said that Bigtown was a safe place, that there's nothing to worry about when you leave.
FO300015614	Whatever you say.
FO300015615	I don't know about that, but Bittercup is one dumbass name.
FO300015616	FINE! Be that way! You'll be sorry! You'll all be sorry!
FO300015617	Finally! Someone who doesn't judge me! You know, the people here are just so quick to assume that they know everything about you.
FO300015618	I mean, like, just because I look different doesn't mean that I'm some sort of freak, you know? It's like, hello, this world sucks!
FO300015619	No one gets that, they're all like "blah blah blah, what's wrong with that girl?".
FO300015620	Nice to meet you, Bittercup.
FO300015621	Finally! Someone who doesn't judge me! You know, the people here are just so quick to assume that they know everything about you.
FO300015622	I mean, like, just because I'm different doesn't mean that I'm some sort of freak, you know? It's like, hello, this world sucks!
FO300015623	No one gets that, they're all like "blah blah blah, what's wrong with that girl?".
FO300015624	Bittercup? That's the dumbest name I've ever heard!
FO300015625	No one understands me. You're just like all the others around here.
FO300015626	Thank you! You're a real hero, you know that? I was going to offer you a reward, but I can put the caps to use buying medicine and supplies.
FO300015627	I'm glad you're safe and sound. And please, I don't want any kind of reward.
FO300015628	Right. What do you want?
FO300015629	I mean you no harm. I'm a simple traveler.
FO300015630	Big Town. You've never heard of it? It's where all the grownups go.
FO300015631	Well, at least when they grow up and out of Little Lamplight.
FO300015632	I can show you the way! There's no reason to waste your time with a bunch of snot-nosed kids. Let's go now!
FO300015633	Where the grownups live?
FO300015634	How about I just kill them all?
FO300015635	That's tempting, but no.
FO300015636	Hannibal is a runaway. His owner wants him back. Just let me know if you find him, and I'll take care of the rest.
FO300015637	You wait here. Let me investigate first.
FO300015638	They look heavily fortified. They knew we were coming. I'm afraid our only choice is to drive them out.
FO300015639	If you don't do it, we will.
FO300015640	Don't be too long. My people can't wait here forever.
FO300015641	Just stay here. I'm not done yet at the Memorial.
FO300015642	I'll give you six hours. Then we're moving on anyway.
FO300015643	Wait here. I need to scout ahead.
FO300015644	Finally! Thank you for all your help.
FO300015645	Okay, it's safe.
FO300015646	Never heard of him. If I find anything, though, I'll be sure to show it to you.
FO300015647	I'm glad to see we understand each other.
FO300015648	My sources say the old Museum of History might have some, but I can't spare anyone to go look.
FO300015649	Just make sure I get first crack at anything you find.
FO300015650	Never heard of it. Is it a ruin around here?
FO300015651	Not exactly. That means you aren't much of a threat to us, so let me tell you a bit more.
FO300015652	We're setting up a base to excavate these ruins. We're looking for anything related to Abraham Lincoln.
FO300015653	So if I find anything like that, you might buy it from me?
FO300015654	I like the way your mind works.
FO300015655	Tell you what. I can't spare anyone to go poking in the old Museum. If you find anything in there, I'll buy it off you.
FO300015656	Actually, I can leave her for the Radroaches. Just watch me.
FO300015657	No! Please! I'll do anything! You can join the Tunnel Snakes! I'll be your best friend forever! You gotta help her!
FO300015658	Why do you need my help, anyway? Afraid of a few Radroaches?
FO300015659	So I'm begging you, please help her. I don't know what I'd do without my mom.
FO300015660	All right. I'll help. But I'm doing this for your mom, not for you.
FO300015661	Sure. I don't care why. Just get her out of there!
FO300015662	I've got a game you can play. It's called "Hide and Go Fuck Yourself."
FO300015663	Potty mouth!
FO300015664	You're mean. Leave me alone!
FO300015665	Hey, look what I found. You're getting sent to military school. <Lie.>
FO300015666	What? No I'm not!
FO300015667	I can't take your babbling. You're on your own. Good luck getting to Big Town.
FO300015668	What? But you said you'd take me. This bites. You really suck, you know that?! I hope a mutant bites your face off and you die! I hate you!
FO300015669	Wow, you're annoying. You'd better make this worth my time.
FO300015670	She's a doctor, so she's sure to have lots of money. She'll give them to you for making sure I get there safely.
FO300015671	I'm not playing this game.
FO300015672	Whatever.
FO300015673	MS01ShutUp1
FO300015674	No, YOU shut up!
FO300015675	Shut up, you!
FO300015676	You stop talking!
FO300015677	Just quit talking.
FO300015678	No, you shut it!
FO300015679	Shut it!
FO300015680	You zip it first!
FO300015681	Zip it!
FO300015682	La-la-la-la-laaaaa! YOU shut up!
FO300015683	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
FO300015684	You shut up!
FO300015685	Where's Big Town located?
FO300015686	You have?
FO300015687	I mean of course you have, it's an awesome place. Well, enough talking, let's get a move on. You ARE taking me to Big Town, right?
FO300015688	Big Town? I've been there before.
FO300015689	It's east of Little Lamplight. Come on, let's go there. It's not that far away. We'll be there in no time!
FO300015690	All right, let's go to Big Town.
FO300015691	Alright! Yeah! Big Town, here we come!
FO300015692	MS01StickHandsEscortStory
FO300015693	And one day this giant Super Mutant attacked him and tried carrying him off!
FO300015694	And one day a space ship from outer space landed right in front of him, and a big green alien jumped out and started eating people!
FO300015695	And one day a giant ant came up to him and started talking like he wasn't some dumb ant, but a person of some kind! It said, "Prepare to die!"
FO300015696	And was our so-called hero scared? You bet he was. He cried like a little baby! "Waa! Waa! Waaaaah!!!" And all his friends laughed at him!
FO300015697	The End! Thank you, thank you very much!
FO300015698	The End! That's all folks!
FO300015699	The End!
FO300015700	MS01StickyHandsEscort
FO300015701	I know, let's make up a story to pass the time.
FO300015702	Are we there yet?
FO300015703	Why is this taking so long?
FO300015704	Are you lost?
FO300015705	<whistling tunelessly>
FO300015706	MS01StickyHandsSneak
FO300015707	Right. Be sneaky. I can do that!
FO300015708	Oh, we're sneaking around now? Cool!
FO300015709	Shhh!
FO300015710	MS01StickyHandsCantGoIn
FO300015711	I'll wait over here for you. When you're done playing with the children we'll go to Big Town.
FO300015712	I'm not a baby! I'm a grownup!
FO300015713	That's why I'm going to Big Town. Because I'm not a little kid anymore.
FO300015714	So you see: I don't need you. Good luck with those kids! You're gonna need it.
FO300015715	You're on your own. I'm not interested in babysitting duty.
FO300015716	Don't thank me. I got what I wanted out of it.
FO300015717	Well, you can never be too careful! Be warned it's not safe here. Super Mutants attacked recently and carried off some of our friends.
FO300015718	Come in. Just don't cause any trouble, okay?
FO300015719	Do you harass all of your visitors like this?
FO300015720	MS01GreetingB2
FO300015721	Thanks!
FO300015722	It was my pleasure!
FO300015723	Alright. There's a back door somewhere nearby we can use. Let's go!
FO300015724	Enough chit-chat. It's time to get out of here.
FO300015725	You don't have to tell me twice. Let's go!
FO300015726	Enough chit-chat. It's time to get out of here.
FO300015727	Take me to Big Town and you'll get your reward. My girlfriend Red has lots of caps.
FO300015728	Ill wait for you outside, unless you want to go now?
FO300015729	You got any caps? I'll escort you Big Town, but it'll cost you.
FO300015730	Don't think you're any safer in here, though. Super Mutants won't leave us alone. Carried off some of our friends during the last attack.
FO300015731	Just don't cause any trouble, okay?
FO300015732	Oh, I don't know. I was thinking I'd start a few fires and kill some people.
FO300015733	MS01GreetingB1
FO300015734	Well, I guess you can have this. It's the money I was saving to buy medicine for the town's people.
FO300015735	I saved your life. This is all I get? Surely you can spare a little more.
FO300015736	Everyone else is dead or taken away to who knows where. Let's hurry back to Big Town!
FO300015737	Is there anyone else?
FO300015738	Well, except maybe for Shorty! They dragged him off downstairs to the kitchen a while ago.
FO300015739	But no one comes back from the kitchen.
FO300015740	Is there anyone else?
FO300015741	I'm not allowed in Little Lamplight anymore.
FO300015742	Only people under 18 get to live in Little Lamplight
FO300015743	So, when your done with those little kids, we can go to Big Town together! I'll wait outside for you.
FO300015744	Fine. I'll take you to Big Town. But first I need to visit Little Lamplight.
FO300015745	Well, you can never be too careful. Be warned it's not safe here. Super Mutants have attacked recently and carried off some of our friends.
FO300015746	Come in. Just don't cause any trouble, okay?
FO300015747	I just want to look around a little. Don't worry about me. I won't hurt you.
FO300015748	Nah, I'm a grownup now. I can handle myself.
FO300015749	There's no reason to waste your time with the kiddies at Little Lamplight. They'll steal your caps when you aren't looking.
FO300015750	So let's go to Big Town. I can show you the way!
FO300015751	Looks to me like you want someone to escort you to Big Town.
FO300015752	Right. Of course. Rescuing me was a job to you, and you're a real professional. Well, here you go. I wish I had more I could give you.
FO300015753	You are planning on giving me a reward for rescuing you, right?
FO300015754	Take it easy. I'm just doing my job. What do you want?
FO300015755	I'm Queen of the Wasteland. What does it matter? You going to let me in or not?
FO300015756	Easy there, pal. I'm just doing my job. What do you want?
FO300015757	I'm King of the Wasteland. What does it matter? You going to let me in or not?
FO300015758	Alright. And now that you're done, what are you still doing here?
FO300015759	I'm escorting Sticky from Little Lamplight.
FO300015760	Why would you want to visit a bunch of snot-nosed children?
FO300015761	Wouldn't you rather go to Big Town?
FO300015762	Of course you would! Come on. Let's go. I can show you the way!
FO300015763	I want to visit Little Lamplight first. Maybe later.
FO300015764	MS01StickyHandsGetPlayersAttention
FO300015765	Hey you. Yeah you! Don't bother with the children at Little Lamplight. Let's go to Big Town instead!
FO300015766	Nah, I'm just kidding.
FO300015767	That's a dumb joke. You're not funny at all.
FO300015768	Look, I've got the brochure right here. You're going, pal.
FO300015769	[crying]
FO300015770	Why is my father so determined to work on this project again?
FO300015771	Project Purity was everything to us. It was the first thing we thought about when we woke up, the last thing we talked about before sleep.
FO300015772	Some of us changed over the years, but apparently James hasn't.
FO300015773	Why wouldn't you help him when he came to you?
FO300015774	I don't have to justify myself to you, you know.
FO300015775	It's just been too long. Too much has happened, and going back now would be a waste. It's just not worth it.
FO300015776	MQ03RoboBrainHostility
FO300015777	Hostilities will not be tolerated.
FO300015778	MQ03RoboBrainWarning
FO300015779	Please refrain from disturbing our other residents.
FO300015780	Please do not disturb the other residents. Take your seat.

FO300015782	A Tranquility Lounger is available. Please be seated.
FO300015783	Please find the nearest Tranquility Lounger and be seated.
FO300015784	Please take a seat in the nearest available Tranquility Lounger. Thank you for your cooperation.
FO300015785	MQ04TimmyMourn
FO300015786	Mommy? Mommy?! No! [crying]
FO300015787	Daddy? Daddy?! No! [crying]
FO300015788	Sorry, Butch. You're on your own. I've got to go.
FO300015789	You're a real bastard, you know that? I hate your fucking guts!
FO300015790	Get away from me, you sick bastard!
FO300015791	No, I'm just fucking with you. I came back to see if your mom was dead yet.
FO300015792	Here, take my BB Gun. You don't need to be scared of the Roaches now.
FO300015793	Wow, where'd you get that? Okay, okay. Maybe I can do this.
FO300015794	Alright. I'm gonna go back in there and kill those damn roaches. Thanks!
FO300015795	This would squish those little buggers real nice. Okay, okay. Maybe I can do this.
FO300015796	Alright. I'm gonna go back in there and kill those damn roaches. Thanks!
FO300015797	Here, take my Baseball Bat. Now you can handle the Roaches on your own.
FO300015798	Fine. I'll save your mom.
FO300015799	Oh my God, thank you. Of course I'll shut up. I promise, I won't tell anybody I saw you. You can count on me.
FO300015800	Look, if you just shut up I'll go save your mom.
FO300015801	Oh my God, thank you. I didn't know what to do. You're the best!
FO300015802	Yeah, I decided to help her after all. But I still think you're an asshole.
FO300015803	RaiderTalkShortGoodMorningResponse
FO300015804	Well ain't you just a regular bushy tailed mother fucker today?
FO300015805	What's so good about it?
FO300015806	Good morning? What the hell is wrong with you?
FO300015807	RaiderTalkShortHelloResponse
FO300015808	Fuck off.
FO300015809	Yo.
FO300015810	Hey.
FO300015811	What's up?
FO300015812	What's goin' on?
FO300015813	S'up?
FO300015814	Nice night.
FO300015815	Good morning!
FO300015816	What a good morning!
FO300015817	FFRaiderCamp07Holotape
FO300015818	Come again, come again.  Any truckers on this wave?
FO300015819	I read you, buddy.  Y'all see those clouds?  Over.
FO300015820	10-4, it's the commies.  Let's circle the wagons, meet us at the state line on Route Seven.
FO300015821	You're a real bastard, you know that? I hate your guts, you fucking coward!
FO300015822	Okay, sure! Uh, you can join the Tunnel Snakes! I'll be your best friend forever! Whatever you want. Just save my mom!
FO300015823	Ooh, I could be a Tunnel Snake!? Good luck with the Roaches. I'm out of here.
FO300015824	You're a real bastard, you know that? I hate your guts, you fucking coward!
FO300015825	Forget I mentioned it.
FO300015826	You would do well to side with my employer in this little matter. Life could otherwise become quite unbearable for you.
FO300015827	Indeed. A man's word is worth his weight in caps. I suppose I could arrange for a bonus of say, 500 caps in addition to the base fee.
FO300015828	When it's done, meet me at Tenpenny Tower. It's southwest of here, well out of harm's way. You can't miss it. Any questions?
FO300015829	Have you thought about disarming the bomb?
FO300015830	Oh, I couldn’t do that! It’d be a real blow to those nice folks in the Church.
FO300015831	Besides, it’s not like that bomb ever hurt anyone. Live and let live, right?
FO300015832	MS11NukeView
FO300015833	Now that, my friend, is beautiful.
FO300015834	Well done, Mister Burke! What a grand display of fireworks! I almost wish there was another nuke we could detonate. You don't see that very often.
FO300015835	I'm glad you're pleased. I had help, of course.
FO300015836	I'll send someone up as soon as I've completed business with our friend here.
FO300015837	Righto. And be quick about it! I haven't been dry in years. I'd hate to start now.
FO300015838	You're big. They're little. Just go back in there and squish them. Be a hero!
FO300015839	Your mom's already done for. You'd better run before those Roaches come for you.
FO300015840	Oh my God, you're right! I can hear their little scratchy feet coming this way. I gotta get out of here!
FO300015841	I don't suppose there's more you can tell me about Oasis?
FO300015842	Sorry, I believe that duty lay with Tree Father Birch.
FO300015843	No, maybe some other time.
FO300015844	Oh! Well, let me know if you change your mind.
FO300015845	Yes, I'd like to speak to Tree Father Birch.
FO300015846	I was hoping you'd say that. Please, proceed inside.
FO300015847	Perhaps some other time. I have more urgent matters to attend to.
FO300015848	I'm very saddened to hear that, a great opportunity like this may come only once in a lifetime.
FO300015849	If you wish to return and speak to me, talk to Branchtender Maple. She'll allow you to go inside.
FO300015850	All I ask is you keep our existence a secret. Too many out there in the Wasteland would seek to exploit Him. Farewell.
FO300015851	No way! You're obviously out of your mind!
FO300015852	I'm very saddened to hear that, a great opportunity like this may come only once in a lifetime.
FO300015853	If you wish to return and speak to me, talk to Branchtender Maple. She'll allow you to go inside.
FO300015854	All I ask is you keep our existence a secret. Too many out there in the Wasteland would seek to exploit Him. Farewell.
FO300015855	Okay, I'll follow you. Lead on.
FO300015856	Excellent! Please, follow me. All will be explained soon.
FO300015857	I'm not following anyone. I need to be on my way.
FO300015858	I can promise you that if you leave, you'll be missing out on a great honor. Not many have even seen Him before, and yet he wants to speak to you.
FO300015859	Please, I beg you. Don't make Him wait any longer. Follow me inside to the Pavilion, and I promise all will be explained!
FO300015860	The Treeminders?
FO300015861	Yes, we're the Treeminders. We're His people.
FO300015862	If you'll just follow me inside to the Pavilion, all will be explained.
FO300015863	Who's waiting for me inside?
FO300015864	Why, He is of course.
FO300015865	If you'll just follow me to the Pavilion, all will be explained.
FO300015866	Sure, lead on.
FO300015867	Excellent! Please, follow me. All will be explained soon.
FO300015868	Whoa, whoa. Slow down, old man. What the hell are you babbling about?
FO300015869	I'm sorry, in my excitement, I got ahead of myself.
FO300015870	I'm Tree Father Birch, and I have the great fortune of being leader of His people, the Treeminders.
FO300015871	Beyond that gate is our home, Oasis.
FO300015872	Ha ha ha! What the hell are you wearing?
FO300015873	I am wearing the clothes of a Treeminder. We shed our Wasteland garments like the ones you're wearing long ago.
FO300015874	I'm not following anyone until I know what's going on here.
FO300015875	I'm sorry, in my excitement, I got ahead of myself.
FO300015876	I'm Tree Father Birch, and I have the great fortune of being leader of His people, the Treeminders.
FO300015877	Beyond that gate is our home, Oasis.
FO300015878	Just a minute. Who are you and what is this place?
FO300015879	I'm sorry, in my excitement, I got ahead of myself.
FO300015880	I'm Tree Father Birch, and I have the great fortune of being leader of His people, the Treeminders.
FO300015881	Beyond that gate is our home, Oasis.
FO300015882	I think you're all a bunch of lunatics.
FO300015883	Ha ha ha. I don't expect you to understand everything you see here. After all, you carry the taint of technology upon you.
FO300015884	Treeminders shun technology and embrace nature. All technology has brought the world is violence and death.
FO300015885	Treeminders, huh? That's a strange name.
FO300015886	Is it so strange to care for one's home and keep it safe from those who would seek to exploit it?
FO300015887	He gives to us, so we give back to Him. It's an arrangement that's worked well for almost two decades.
FO300015888	We shun technology and embrace nature. That's the life of a Treeminder.
FO300015889	Why do you call yourselves Treeminders?
FO300015890	We care for this place and keep it safe from those who would seek to exploit it.
FO300015891	He gives to us, so we give back to Him. It's an arrangement that's worked well for almost two decades.
FO300015892	We shun technology and embrace nature. That's the life of a Treeminder.
FO300015893	Can you cut the "Him" crap already and just tell me who he is?
FO300015894	He is the One Who Grows, He is the One Who Gives and He is the One Who Guides.
FO300015895	No one speaks His name out of reverence for His majesty.
FO300015896	Thanks to Him, the Treeminders have a home.
FO300015897	He is the One Who Grows, He is the One Who Gives and He is the One Who Guides.
FO300015898	No one speaks His name out of reverence for His majesty.
FO300015899	Thanks to Him, the Treeminders have a home.
FO300015900	Who is it you keep referring to as "Him"?
FO300015901	He is the One Who Grows, He is the One Who Gives and He is the One Who Guides.
FO300015902	No one speaks His name out of reverence for His majesty.
FO300015903	Thanks to Him, the Treeminders have a home.
FO300015904	So what was all this about meeting someone?
FO300015905	As you approached Oasis, He said you were coming and I was sent out to meet you personally with a request.
FO300015906	He wishes to meet with you. You'd be the first Outsider to do so in a very long time.
FO300015907	What you call scared, I call humbled. This place is a blessing to all of us.
FO300015908	Everything you see around you, from the tallest tree to the smallest blade of grass is a gift. A gift from Him.
FO300015909	This place is weird. Where do you plug stuff in?
FO300015910	Ha ha ha! We no longer use devices like that. We cast our technology away many years ago.
FO300015911	Everything you see around you, from the tallest tree to the smallest blade of grass is a gift. A gift from Him.
FO300015912	I've never seen anyplace like this.
FO300015913	No, I suppose you haven't. In fact, few who live outside of Oasis have.
FO300015914	Everything you see around you, from the tallest tree to the smallest blade of grass is a gift. A gift from Him.
FO300015915	Well, then I guess he's cheating on you.
FO300015916	It looks like Roger is a fan of women's clothing.
FO300015917	Just trust me. It's important.
FO300015918	Okay, if you say so.
FO300015919	Nothing. Never mind.
FO300015920	Okay.
FO300015921	What were you doing in our basement? What's down there?
FO300015922	I'm here to kill you, and there's nothing you can do about it.
FO300015923	What! No, please! I'm begging you.
FO300015924	Oh, yeah? Give it your best shot, clown shoes!
FO300015925	I'm going to put a bullet right between your eyes.
FO300015926	Assassin!
FO300015927	Guards! Security!
FO300015928	I'm going to put a bullet in your brain, you Ghoul hating piece of shit!
FO300015929	Well, go get it!
FO300015930	I'm not going to just take your word for it. I want that key.
FO300015931	Well, go get it!
FO300015932	I'm not going to just take your word for it. I want something of his as proof.
FO300015933	Sure. Take it. I don't have any use for it.
FO300015934	Ah! My trophy. You've earned your reward.
FO300015935	Hmm. I guess you were telling me the truth. Take your caps.
FO300015936	Okay. I believe you. Here's your money.
FO300015937	Allistair Tenpenny is already dead.
FO300015938	Damn! He's the one I most wanted to die by my hand.
FO300015939	At least he's dead somehow. Here. I'll give you 25 caps for the news, but I'm not going to pay you to kill a dead man.
FO300015940	He is?
FO300015941	I don't care. All I want is that damn key. No key, no caps.
FO300015942	I've got bad news. Ted Strayer is already dead.
FO300015943	He is?
FO300015944	I don't believe you. Give me some proof, a ring, a key, something.
FO300015945	I've got bad news. Ted Strayer is already dead.
FO300015946	I shouldn't be surprised. The way he lived it was bound to happen sooner or later.
FO300015947	All you have to do now is bring me his key. No key, no caps.
FO300015948	I hate to admit this, but Dukov is already dead.
FO300015949	I shouldn't be surprised. The way he lived it was bound to happen sooner or later.
FO300015950	Wait. How do I know you aren't lying? I want proof. Some personal object of his. No proof, no caps.
FO300015951	I hate to admit this, but Dukov is already dead.
FO300015952	Really? That bastard finally bit it?
FO300015953	Such is life. Do you have his key? No key, no caps.
FO300015954	Really? That bastard finally bit it?
FO300015955	Wait a minute. You could be lying. You got something of his as proof? No proof, no caps.
FO300015956	Janet snapped. She killed Martha in cold blood. Look at this rolling pin.
FO300015957	Janet did this to Martha? She really did snap, didn't she?
FO300015958	Look at this. It's her rolling pin, covered in blood. Martha's blood.
FO300015959	I mean, I know she was upset, but I thought she was over it. How could she do this?
FO300015960	Bad news, Roger. Your wife is a psychopath.
FO300015961	What? What are you talking about?
FO300015962	It's your basement, lady. You tell me.
FO300015963	This isn't mine. Why would Roger have this down here?
FO300015964	MS01KitchenConversation
FO300015965	You freak! You're going to eat me, aren't you?
FO300015966	Grrr! Hungry!
FO300015967	There's plenty of body parts laying around, why don't you eat those instead?
FO300015968	Not fresh! Not warm! Taste old.
FO300015969	I hope you choke on my bones!
FO300015970	Hahaha! Not your tiny bones, little man! Grrrraaaahhhh!
FO300015971	Who you calling little?!
FO300015972	Shut up now! Grraaaah!
FO300015973	Oh God. Kill me quickly, I beg you!
FO300015974	Grrr! Hahaha! Graaah!
FO300015975	Come on. Follow me.
FO300015976	We'll be right behind you.
FO300015977	You and Shorty, follow me.
FO300015978	We'll stick with you, don't worry!
FO300015979	You and Red, follow me.
FO300015980	Well, all right. Don't get us killed, okay?
FO300015981	I'll just hope you know what you're doing.
FO300015982	I'm right behind you!
FO300015983	Right! Let's go!
FO300015984	There's a back door somewhere nearby we can use. Let's go to Big Town. You can get a hot meal and I'll tend to any wounds you've taken. Let's go!
FO300015985	We shouldn't risk our lives for someone who's probably already dead.
FO300015986	I'm not waiting around for some Super Mutant to lock me up again!
FO300015987	There's a back door somewhere around here. If you're not back soon, I'm leaving without you! If I'm not here when you come back, meet me at Big Town.
FO300015988	You wait right here, I'll go see about Shorty.
FO300015989	MS01StickyHandsHurrayBigTown
FO300015990	There it is! We're almost there! Come on! Yiiipppiiieee!
FO300015991	Keep your secret. I wouldn't want to take advantage of you.
FO300015992	You're a real friend. My real friend.
FO300015993	So what's this secret?
FO300015994	I know where Belle keeps her stash. But she doesn't know I know.
FO300015995	She keeps it under her bed. Real original, huh?
FO300015996	I think I need to puke.
FO300015997	Aren't you swell. Did you need something else or can I go back to my patrol?
FO300015998	Gee, thanks. Are we done here?
FO300015999	Kill you? Sounds like fun. Let's do that.
FO300016000	Then I'm going down fighting!
FO300016001	So, it's pretty much a free-for-all here? Where do you keep your good stuff?
FO300016002	Yeah, yeah, you're a scary wastelander. Look, you'll either kill us, or you won't.
FO300016003	Most of us have already accepted death so you won't get much of a reaction with your threats. At least we won't be slaves if you shoot us all.
FO300016004	I'm sure you'll manage.
FO300016005	Yeah, we'll see.
FO300016006	Who lives here?
FO300016007	There aren't many of us left. There's me and Pappy. Red runs the clinic, but she's been taken by the mutant. Kimba does what she can.
FO300016008	And there's Bittercup. She's just about as useless as a human being can be. Timebomb was hurt in the last raid, so he's out.
FO300016009	That's about it. The Mutants and Slavers have taken everyone else. Just us and a couple of guns are all that's left.
FO300016010	There aren't many of us left. There's me and Pappy. Red runs the clinic. Kimba does what she can.
FO300016011	And there's Bittercup. She's just about as useless as a human being can be. Timebomb was hurt in the last raid, so he's out. Shorty is unpredictable.
FO300016012	That's about it. The Mutants and Slavers have taken everyone else. Just us and a couple of guns are all that's left.
FO300016013	Why don't you leave?
FO300016014	And where are we going to go? Megaton won't have us, Lamplight won't take us back, and Rivet City is too far.
FO300016015	Besides, the bunch of us can't even hold this town, can you imagine us shlepping across the wasteland?
FO300016016	Trouble? What kind of trouble?
FO300016017	Well, we've got Super Mutants out that way and Slavers up that way. Take your pick.
FO300016018	They both come in here, drag off as many as they can carry and shoot whoever puts up a fight.
FO300016019	The best we can ever hope for is that they get here at the same time and fight over who gets to kill us.
FO300016020	Can't we skip all this nonsense?
FO300016021	I'm afraid not. No one gets to see Him without first drinking the Sap from the basin here in the Pavilion.
FO300016022	The Sap will purify your mind and body of anything harmful that could possibly hurt Him.
FO300016023	Other than that, there's nothing more to the ceremony.
FO300016024	Hang on, you never said anything about a ceremony!
FO300016025	There's no reason to be alarmed.
FO300016026	All that must be done is you must drink the Sap from the basin here in the Pavilion.
FO300016027	The Sap will purify your mind and body of anything harmful that could possibly hurt Him.
FO300016028	It's simple really. You drink the Sap from the basin here in the Pavilion.
FO300016029	The Sap will purify your mind and body of anything harmful that could possibly hurt Him.
FO300016030	I assure you, nothing harmful will happen to you.
FO300016031	Okay already. Let's get this going.
FO300016032	To meet Him, you must undergo the Ceremony of Purification. Once that's complete, you'll be able to speak to Him.
FO300016033	Whenever you're ready, we may begin.
FO300016034	And where can I find this person?
FO300016035	To meet Him, you must undergo the Ceremony of Purification. Once that's complete, you'll be able to speak to Him.
FO300016036	Whenever you're ready, we may begin.
FO300016037	I would be honored to meet this person.
FO300016038	To meet Him, you must undergo the Ceremony of Purification. Once that's complete, you'll be able to speak to Him.
FO300016039	Whenever you're ready, we may begin.
FO300016040	Fine, fine. Get to the point already.
FO300016041	You have much to learn about patience, my friend. However, you are correct, I will get to the point.
FO300016042	As you approached Oasis, He said you were coming and I was sent out to meet you personally with a request.
FO300016043	He wishes to meet with you. You'd be the first Outsider to do so in a very long time.
FO300016044	Which brings us to why I'm here, I suppose.
FO300016045	Yes. Indeed it does. Sorry I don't speak to Outsiders very often and I tend to get lost in conversation.
FO300016046	As you approached Oasis, He said you were coming and I was sent out to meet you personally with a request.
FO300016047	He wishes to meet with you. You'd be the first Outsider to do so in a very long time.
FO300016048	Listen my friend, I will forgive your insolent tone because He has asked to see you.
FO300016049	But make no mistake. If you wish to cause trouble here, we have the means to defend ourselves.
FO300016050	Shun technology? How do you defend yourselves?
FO300016051	The Wasteland is a hostile place and sometimes we're forced to defend ourselves against it.
FO300016052	If that means fighting with manufactured weapons, then so be it.
FO300016053	Had He not asked to see you, you never would have gotten this close to the gates.
FO300016054	If you hate technology, why carry weapons?
FO300016055	Sadly, the Wasteland is a hostile place and sometimes we're forced to defend ourselves against it.
FO300016056	If that means fighting with manufactured weapons, then so be it.
FO300016057	Had He not asked to see you, you never would have gotten this close to the gates.
FO300016058	Forget this whole thing. This is insane!
FO300016059	Then you are free to go. He had requested to see you, but He said not to take you against your will.
FO300016060	It saddens me greatly you don't wish to see Him, but you must follow your own path.
FO300016061	If you change your mind, come speak to me and we'll begin again.
FO300016062	Could we wait just a bit? I'm not quite ready.
FO300016063	I understand, my friend. Preparing to meet Him takes much preparation and soul searching.
FO300016064	You may walk about Oasis as you see fit, but please don't take too long.
FO300016065	When you're ready to undergo the ceremony, just ask.
FO300016066	Okay, let's begin the ceremony.
FO300016067	Very good! Take your place in front of the basin and let's begin.
FO300016068	I'm leaving. This is just crazy.
FO300016069	Then you are free to go. He had requested to see you, but He said not to take you against your will.
FO300016070	It saddens me greatly you don't wish to see Him, but you must follow your own path.
FO300016071	If you change your mind, come speak to me and we'll begin again.
FO300016072	I've changed my mind. I'm not quite ready.
FO300016073	There's nothing to fear here. This is our tradition and our custom, as well as a measure of protection for Him.
FO300016074	If you need a bit of time to reflect, then please do so. All I ask is you return quickly.
FO300016075	When you're ready to undergo the ceremony, just ask.
FO300016076	I'm sorry, I'm ready now.
FO300016077	Then please, return to the basin and we will begin.
FO300016078	I'm ready to undertake the ceremony.
FO300016079	Very good! Take your place in front of the basin and let's begin.
FO300016080	Very good! Take your place in front of the basin and let's begin.
FO300016081	I'd like to start the ceremony again.
FO300016082	I need some time to think about it.
FO300016083	What's to think about? Sigh.
FO300016084	My guys don't have the luxury of time. If you're going to decide, decide soon. Otherwise I'm offering elsewhere.
FO300016085	All right. I'll do it.
FO300016086	Whew, I was holding my breath on that one I think. I wasn't sure what you were going to say.
FO300016087	All I ask is that you hurry. I don't know how much longer they will be able to survive up there.
FO300016088	I also recommend you try and find the body of Theo, one of my men. He was carrying our main ammo supply.
FO300016089	Here, let me punch the ammo box code and some better directions into your Pip-Boy there.
FO300016090	What's in it for me if I risk my neck for you?
FO300016091	Spoken like a merc. You sound like me when I was just a kid starting out in the business.
FO300016092	Okay hotshot, how about a full suit of Ranger Armor? It's the best combat armor in the Wasteland.
FO300016093	Or if that doesn't do it for you I'll set you up with a minigun from our armory. Either way, you walk away with something.
FO300016094	I don't know, Reilly. This sounds like suicide.
FO300016095	Look, I don't know where else to go. In the shape I'm in, I'll be lucky to get ten feet.
FO300016096	I'll sweeten the deal for you, maybe it'll help. How about I set you up with a suit of Ranger Armor if you get them back?
FO300016097	If that doesn't do it for you I'll set you up with a minigun from our armory. Either way, you walk away with something.
FO300016098	So that leaves them up there. How come you're here?
FO300016099	My bad idea I'm afraid. I had a Stealth Boy which allowed me to slip off the roof unnoticed. The plan was to get back to get some help.
FO300016100	I was almost at the street when a Super Mutant jumped me. Damn near ripped my arm off in the process.
FO300016101	Last thing I remember was falling into a culvert. Now I'm here. Some rescue attempt, huh?
FO300016102	What did you need from me?
FO300016103	Get the Rangers home. Please. That's all I want. I don't care how you do it.
FO300016104	Look, I could care less about your stories.
FO300016105	Fine. Since you're all business and obviously don't give a damn about human life, I got a proposal for you.
FO300016106	You want to hear it, or you gonna keep flapping your lips?
FO300016107	Last stand?
FO300016108	Last stand? Well, we hoped not. We figured we'd get up there and get a better signal to radio the Brotherhood of Steel for help.
FO300016109	Problem is, help never arrived. Vernon Square is so thick with the Super Mutants, I don't think they could slip through.
FO300016110	Trapped yourself at the top of a tall building. Brilliant.
FO300016111	Look, I don't know what your problem is, but I got three guys alone out there with an army of Super Mutants around them.
FO300016112	Either help me by listening, or get the hell out of my sight. I'm not here to be judged by you or anyone else.
FO300016113	Now, like I was saying, we had to fight our way up towards the roof of the Statesman.
FO300016114	Bad move, I'm guessing.
FO300016115	Very bad move, but we had no choice.
FO300016116	On the way we lost Theo, one of my guys. We were unable to get the ammo case off of his body as we were pushed onwards.
FO300016117	So, guns almost dry, we hit the roof of the Statesman.
FO300016118	Not a very smart move, if you ask me.
FO300016119	I didn't ask you. Those bastards were everywhere. I don't know what was driving them.
FO300016120	We fought our way to the roof and found a way across to the Statesman Hotel next door.
FO300016121	Once in the hotel, the only way to go was up.
FO300016122	Let me guess, more Super Mutants inside?
FO300016123	You got it. More of the ugly bastards just kept coming. We fought our way to the roof and found a way across to the Statesman Hotel next door.
FO300016124	Once in the hotel, the only way to go was up.
FO300016125	So, what's this about needing help? Tell me the whole story.
FO300016126	We were mapping the Vernon Square part of the downtown ruins and got jumped by a Super Mutant ambush party.
FO300016127	Usually it isn't a problem, but this group was bigger than usual. We fought our way into Our Lady of Hope Hospital, hoping to find cover.
FO300016128	I'd really like to speak to this woman. Please, wake her now.
FO300016129	Oh very well. I will do what I can.
FO300016130	I just hope her body can withstand the strain. Humans are so fragile.
FO300016131	Do you mind if I try and revive her?
FO300016132	Unless you're an expert at medicine, I wouldn't recommend it. You may end up doing more harm than good.
FO300016133	However, I'm all for helping my patients, so if you think you have the ability, be my guest.
FO300016134	Do you think there's any way to revive her?
FO300016135	Well, I wouldn't recommend it. She's in some sort of coma. It's dangerous to force someone out of one.
FO300016136	There's no telling when she'll come out of it I'm afraid.
FO300016137	How did she end up in the Chop Shop?
FO300016138	She was just brought in by a few others. They found her bleeding to death at the entrance to the city here.
FO300016139	If she'd been out in the tunnels any longer, she'd have been someone's meal by now.
FO300016140	What's wrong with her?
FO300016141	She had multiple lacerations, contusions, broken leg, some internal bleeding and blunt force trauma.
FO300016142	She's hasn't been conscious since they brought her in a few days ago.
FO300016143	I'd say she tangled with some Super Mutants and lost. It's a miracle she isn't dead.
FO300016144	Reilly's Rangers?
FO300016145	Oh, you must be new around here.
FO300016146	They're a mercenary company that bases itself out of the D.C. Ruins. I'm assuming she's their leader, Reilly.
FO300016147	What was left of her armor had her name stenciled on it. She was in a pretty bad way when they found her outside Underworld.
FO300016148	I can help you defend yourselves.
FO300016149	Really? That's great. What do you have in mind?
FO300016150	If you can arm yourselves, I can teach you how to shoot.
FO300016151	Great! I'll round everyone up at the junkyard for shooting practice.
FO300016152	I'll teach you how to sneak and hide. They'll think you've deserted the town.
FO300016153	Great! I'll round everyone up. You show us how to hide and sneak.
FO300016154	You should have some robot defenders. I can show you what to do with them.
FO300016155	Great! Let's head over to the junkyard. There're some old robots in there. Maybe you can fix them up and we'll watch to see how it's done.
FO300016156	You could set up a minefield to keep Super Mutants from just strolling in.
FO300016157	That's a great idea! I'll get everyone together. You show us how and we'll plant mines at the bridge into town!
FO300016158	I'll stick around to kill the Super Mutants. They should leave you alone after that.
FO300016159	Really? That's great! I'll let everyone know! You're a real hero you know that?
FO300016160	Law of the Wasteland: Survival of the fittest. You're on your own. Good luck!
FO300016161	Fine. You've done enough already. I get it. We'll figure something out on our own.
FO300016162	Yeah, she's fine. They patched her up and she's resting in Underworld.
FO300016163	That's a relief. I told her she was nuts when she decided to try and sneak out of here. Guess I was wrong. Now, let's talk about getting out of here.
FO300016164	I would have proposed going back the way you came, but apparently it's impossible now.
FO300016165	So, the express elevator is our only solution.
FO300016166	No time for chatter. I'm here to get you guys out.
FO300016167	Hang on there. First, I need to know if Reilly is okay. I assume she made it somewhere if you're here.
FO300016168	Hang on there. First, I need to know if Reilly is okay. I assume she made it somewhere if you're here.
FO300016169	I'm afraid this is it.
FO300016170	Hmmm, and you made it all the way up here alive?
FO300016171	Just you? You made it up here alone?
FO300016172	Where is Theo's body?
FO300016173	We lost him on one of the stairwells on the second floor of the Statesman Hotel.
FO300016174	He almost made it, but one of the Muties hit us with a frag grenade; blew him apart.
FO300016175	If you can get to his ammo crate, there's a ton of rounds inside. Bring as many as you can to the Rangers.
FO300016176	How do I know they're still alive?
FO300016177	Before I left I gave them an order to keep broadcasting for help over their radio.
FO300016178	Hopefully, when you get near their location, you'll pick it up.
FO300016179	Any good news about the area?
FO300016180	Not much I'm afraid. Oh wait, the hospital may have some supplies that will help you.
FO300016181	We saw some storerooms on the way to the roof, but didn't have time to raid them.
FO300016182	How can I get there from Underworld?
FO300016183	Your best bet is to stay with the Metro tunnels. Head north from here to Metro Central. Then look for the tunnels to the Dupont Circle Station.
FO300016184	Exit from Dupont Circle Station into what we call the Dry Sewers and eventually you'll wind up in Our Lady of Hope Hospital.
FO300016185	Tell me more about Reilly's Rangers.
FO300016186	Besides myself of course, we have Brick, our heavy weapons specialist, Butcher, our medic and Donovan, our tech.
FO300016187	All of them have been with me for years. I'd trust any of them with my life.
FO300016188	They're a mercenary group. I've seen them pass through Underworld a few times.
FO300016189	I'm not sure what their mission entails, but I suspect that it involves violence.
FO300016190	The Rangers have a small headquarters not far from here. Let me program the location into your Pip-Boy.
FO300016191	There were five of us in the company until we lost Theo.
FO300016192	Can you think of anything that will help me get there?
FO300016193	We have a headquarters not far from here.
FO300016194	If you can make it there, you are welcome to anything you need inside. Just punch in Reilly0247 at the gate.
FO300016195	We have ammo, supplies, you name it.
FO300016196	What can you tell me about Vernon Square?
FO300016197	If I wasn't asking for your help, I'd tell you to stay away. It's thick with Super Mutants. I don't know why.
FO300016198	Butcher, our team medic, has always suspected something is in the area they are looking for or being attracted to.
FO300016199	The only place worse I can think of is the Mall.
FO300016200	Oh my, that's a dangerous part of the D.C. Ruins.
FO300016201	Every patrol Underworld has sent even near that zone has come back in bad shape, or hasn't returned at all.
FO300016202	All I can tell you is this place sucks. I hope we never have to map another inch of it.
FO300016203	There's something about this area. I can't put my finger on it, but just like the Mall, there is an unusually high concentration of Super Mutants.
FO300016204	If I had the time and resources, I'd investigate. All I care about now is getting the hell off this damn roof.
FO300016205	The other guys hate mappin' this zone, but hey, I love it. I love turning the 'muties into a fine, red mist with my gun.
FO300016206	You're drawing on me, clown shoes? I don't think so!
FO300016207	You're drawing on me, bitch? I don't think so!
FO300016208	I'm a little short on caps right now.
FO300016209	What the fuck is this? You call that money?
FO300016210	Unless you pull 200 caps out of your ass, don't bother me, motherfucker.
FO300016211	I have some caps. How about I buy "proof" that I killed you.
FO300016212	That's too bad, clown shoes. Come back when you can pay to play.
FO300016213	Can your table handle 200 caps?
FO300016214	Now that's what I'm talking about!
FO300016215	You just bought yourself a motherfucking key.
FO300016216	Now take it and get the hell out of here.
FO300016217	Now that's what I'm talking about!
FO300016218	You don't even know what's going on, do you clown shoes? Ha! You just bought yourself a motherfucking key.
FO300016219	Now take it and get the hell out of here.
FO300016220	Here's 200 caps. Give me something to "prove" I killed you.
FO300016221	You can give me the key, or I can take it. Your choice.
FO300016222	You got some big brass ones, you know that. And fuck me if I don't think you could do it.
FO300016223	Here. Take it. Now go fuck yourself before I change my mind.
FO300016224	You got some big brass ones, you know that. And fuck me if I don't think you could do it.
FO300016225	Here. Take this key. It's all he really wants anyway. Now go fuck yourself before I change my mind.
FO300016226	Give me something I can use as proof that I killed you. Or else.
FO300016227	I don't think I need to hear any more.
FO300016228	Good. I'm getting tired of flapping jaw with you, clown shoes.
FO300016229	I think I'll flap my balls against Cherry's ass instead! Oh, yeah!
FO300016230	I've heard enough for now.
FO300016231	Motherfucking right you have! He should have known better than to send some clown shoes of an assassin to take me out.
FO300016232	Actually, Crowley is alive. He wants some sort of security key you have.
FO300016233	So the meatbag is alive, huh? Fine with me. Just show me the money. Put your fucking caps on the table and you can have it.
FO300016234	Fine with me. Just show me the money. Put your fucking caps on the table and you can have it.
FO300016235	He wants some sort of security key you have.
FO300016236	So the meatbag is alive, huh? And I bet I know what he wants.
FO300016237	But I don't know what you want. What's your angle, clown shoes?
FO300016238	Actually, Crowley is alive. I'm supposed to kill you and bring him proof.
FO300016239	Crowley is alive, and he paid me to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
FO300016240	I've got nothing against Ghouls. Ha! I even had a Ghoul party girl once, to see what it was like!
FO300016241	This is about the key, isn't it? The goddamn key. If you want it, I'd better see some fucking caps on the table, clown shoes.
FO300016242	I've learned what I came for. Thank you.
FO300016243	No sweat, man. I'm just chilling out here for a while.
FO300016244	Where did he die?
FO300016245	A little shithole called Fort Constantine. It fucked us up but good.
FO300016246	I'll give you 25 caps for that key.
FO300016247	Oh, yeah! I'm gonna be flying high tonight.
FO300016248	Oh, yeah! I'm gonna be flying high tonight.
FO300016249	I'll give you 25 caps for something I can bring to Crowley, to "prove" you died.
FO300016250	Give me that key. I'd hate to see you bleed to death.
FO300016251	Thanks for the info. I'm just trying to sort all of this out.
FO300016252	No problem dude. Thanks for not offing me.
FO300016253	No problem dude. You're alright.
FO300016254	Mister Crowley wants your father's security key.
FO300016255	Whoa! Is it, like, worth caps? Cause I got needs, man.
FO300016256	Whoa! Is this, like, worth caps? Cause I got needs, man.
FO300016257	I'm guessing Crowley wants your father's key. Just a hunch.
FO300016258	Whoa! Is this, like, worth caps? Cause I got needs, man.
FO300016259	If you give me something personal of yours as proof, I'll lie to Crowley.
FO300016260	Do you know what they were doing at the fort?
FO300016261	Nah. He said that old man Tenpenny hired him and some other guys to go in there, but he never said why.
FO300016262	My dad made enough caps off it to set him up good though.
FO300016263	Can you think of any reason he might want you dead?
FO300016264	Like I told you, man. I never met the dude. Why would he want me dead?
FO300016265	Are you sure you can't think of any reason he might want you dead?
FO300016266	No shit! That dude wants me dead?
FO300016267	Sounds like a normal guy.
FO300016268	You're too nosy for your own good. It can be a dangerous habit.
FO300016269	Sorry. Just forget it.
FO300016270	Yes. He's much nicer than some of my guests.
FO300016271	Yeah, well don't let it happen again.
FO300016272	I see your point.
FO300016273	Really? That's a relief.
FO300016274	Me? No, I haven't heard a thing.
FO300016275	You're as cheap as the rest of them.
FO300016276	Sorry, pal. I can't spare the caps either.
FO300016277	Sheesh. Wastelanders get dumber every day.
FO300016278	Is that a hint? You want me to bribe you? No way.
FO300016279	I don't give away anything for free. Besides, its obviously worth something to you.
FO300016280	Why should I have to pay for gossip?
FO300016281	Is there anything else you need?
FO300016282	Damn. Another dead end. Thanks anyway.
FO300016283	A whole bottle? You got a deal. All I know is that he keeps trying to hire outsiders to do some killing.
FO300016284	I heard him mumble something about a Fort too.
FO300016285	How about a whole bottle? Here's 10 caps.
FO300016286	Very funny.
FO300016287	Crowley has some scam going where he's going to get rich.
FO300016288	He tried to get me to kill these three guys, but I wouldn't do it. I've met Dave, and he's no more of a Ghoul bigot than I am.
FO300016289	Come on. You can tell me. Ahzrukhal said so. <Lie.>
FO300016290	Oh, well that's different.
FO300016291	You're the third human he's tried to get to kill those guys.
FO300016292	He won't ask me, or anyone else in Underworld. It's kind of weird.
FO300016293	Well, he does keep talking about how he's going to make his fortune soon.
FO300016294	He says as soon as he finds some wastelander to do his dirty work, he'll be set for life.
FO300016295	I think it's just the whiskey talking. Vile stuff.
FO300016296	So he doesn't do anything strange?
FO300016297	Ah, what the hell. Crowley shows up here last year, he's a Ghoul just like the rest of us.
FO300016298	Now, all of sudden he's looking for payback against Ghoul haters. Except, I've met Dukov. He never insulted a Ghoul in his life.
FO300016299	Dukov's got the foulest mouth in the wasteland. He's a drunk and a womanizer, but he's no bigot. Go ask him yourself.
FO300016300	No one will ever know. Come on.
FO300016301	Damn. Double damn. He finally got someone to kill them humans.
FO300016302	Someone believed that pack of lies he's been spreading. Well I just hope they talk to those poor folk before knocking them off.
FO300016303	Of course. I already know. I just wondered if you've heard.
FO300016304	Deal. All I know is that he keeps trying to hire outsiders to do some killing.
FO300016305	Here's 3 caps for a drink, but you've got to tell me what you know.
FO300016306	Ooh, a big spender.
FO300016307	Well, it's better than nothing. Crowley has been outfitting himself for some big expedition.
FO300016308	He's up to something, but he isn't saying what.
FO300016309	Okay! Okay! No need to get upset.
FO300016310	Crowley is running some sort of scam. He tried to get me to kill some wastelanders, but I wouldn't do it.
FO300016311	Dave is one of them. I've met Dave, and he's mighty strange, but he's no bigot. He doesn't hate Ghouls any more than I do.
FO300016312	How about I don't. How about you just tell me.
FO300016313	Alright! Alright!
FO300016314	Sometimes he comes by and asks me about the security system and stuff. You know, technical details about locks and computers.
FO300016315	It's not just chit-chat either. He's angling for something, but I don't know what. Talk to Ahzrukhal up at the Ninth Circle about Crowley.
FO300016316	Don't make me beat it out of you.
FO300016317	What can you tell me about Mister Crowley?
FO300016318	Ahzrukhal doesn't like it when I talk about his customers.
FO300016319	What's the deal with Crowley?
FO300016320	The back room renter? Oh, he's a swell guest. So polite too. Never gets mad at anyone.
FO300016321	I've been letting that room to him for about a year now.
FO300016322	Do you know Mister Crowley?
FO300016323	Who? Never heard of him.
FO300016324	What do you know about Mister Crowley?
FO300016325	If I start telling tales about my customers, I'll lose all of them.
FO300016326	Does Crowley spend a lot of time in here? What's his angle?
FO300016327	Nothing. Why? What have you heard? You've heard something haven't you?
FO300016328	What do you know about Mister Crowley?
FO300016329	He's not my type. Doc Barrows is friendly with him though. Why don't you ask him.
FO300016330	Do you talk to Crowley much? Can you tell me anything about him?
FO300016331	I know he doesn't sell Jet. Bastard.
FO300016332	You want to know about Crowley? Go ask Quinn or Greta. I don't follow the gossip around here like they do.
FO300016333	He's an odd one. Why just a few months ago he decided he didn't like people calling us zombies.
FO300016334	No Ghoul likes to be called a zombie, but Crowley was going up to humans and almost daring them to do it.
FO300016335	Won't never buy me a drink, that's what.
FO300016336	Does Crowley come in here a lot? What's his angle?
FO300016337	I might know something interesting, if you're willing to pay for it.
FO300016338	So, what's that Mister Crowley up to?
FO300016339	Whoa! That's a blast from the past.
FO300016340	My dad knew a dude named Crowley. I never met him though.
FO300016341	I think Dad said he died when they were checking out some old fort.
FO300016342	Do you know a Mister Crowley?
FO300016343	Hey, didn't we already talk about this? Isn't that the dude that wants to kill me?
FO300016344	Like I told you, my dad knew this Crowley dude. I never met him though.
FO300016345	Dad said he died when they were checking out some old fort.
FO300016346	Hey, didn't we already talk about this?
FO300016347	My dad knew a dude named Crowley. I never met him though.
FO300016348	I think Dad said he died when they were checking out some old fort.
FO300016349	He's fucking dead, that's what I can tell you.
FO300016350	Feral Ghouls ripped his nuts off and ate them for dinner.
FO300016351	Someone said you might know a Mister Crowley. Care to comment?
FO300016352	There's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
FO300016353	Before the people elected me President, I worked with a mercenary named Mister Crowley.
FO300016354	We were part of an expedition to Fort Constantine.
FO300016355	Mister President, do you know a Ghoul named Mister Crowley?
FO300016356	Never heard of him.
FO300016357	Wait. I think I do remember Allistair Tenpenny mentioning him once. Something about a job. It was before I met him.
FO300016358	Have you ever heard of a Mister Crowley?
FO300016359	The Ghoul? He's dead. Died twenty years ago.
FO300016360	Good riddance too. I hate those shufflers.
FO300016361	Do you remember a Mister Crowley?
FO300016362	Sure. People like that don't deserve to live.
FO300016363	Excellent! Take this sniper rifle. You'll need it.
FO300016364	Here's a list of the guys and their last known locations. Word will get around if Tenpenny is killed, but I'll need proof for the others.
FO300016365	Bring me back something personal from each of them as proof. Like a key or ring or something.
FO300016366	I don't like where this is headed.
FO300016367	Forget it. I guess you aren't the right type.
FO300016368	Not for the right cause.
FO300016369	Or the right money, heh?
FO300016370	I've got this list of people. Ghoul bigots. Real scum.
FO300016371	I've only got four guys left on the list. Started with eleven. All of them hate Ghouls and treat us like we're zombies.
FO300016372	They all deserve to die. But it has to be done with a head shot. Just like the old stories where zombies can only be killed that way.
FO300016373	I'll give you 100 caps for each of them. If they die some other way, I'm only paying 25 though.
FO300016374	Hey, that's your loss, smoothkin.
FO300016375	I don't think so.
FO300016376	I thought so. No stomach for hard work.
FO300016377	Alrighty then. I'll just be going.
FO300016378	Suit yourself.
FO300016379	Okay. What's the plan?
FO300016380	Not everyone is as sympathetic to Ghouls as you are. In fact some humans are downright bigots.
FO300016381	They treat us like zombies, calling us brain eaters and shufflers.
FO300016382	All true, except for the part about the mutants, the water and the whore.
FO300016383	Ha, ha! I like a human that knows his place. Too many of you think we're all just zombies.
FO300016384	They don’t know, or don’t care, that we’re just as human as they are inside. We bleed! We hurt! We regret!
FO300016385	And you know what really pisses me off?
FO300016386	They think the only way to kill us is to shoot us in the head, like in the old zombie stories, and that will put us out of our misery.
FO300016387	Hey, I know! Maybe you could help me even the score.
FO300016388	Milk sucking? You shuffle stepping, brain eating, grave loving zombie!
FO300016389	Another human bigot. It figures. Go mate with a Super Mutant.
FO300016390	Hey! I'm just looking to trade a drink for some gossip.
FO300016391	Humph. Not sure I know anything of use, but I'll take that drink.
FO300016392	That will cost you two caps.
FO300016393	Humph. Not sure I know anything of use, but ask away.
FO300016394	Hey! I'm just trying to get some fresh news.
FO300016395	Easy now. I've got nothing against Ghouls.
FO300016396	Is that so?  Even if I call you a milk-sucking, mutant-loving, water-stealing whore?
FO300016397	Is that so?  Even if I call you a milk-sucking, mutant-loving, water-stealing son of a whore?
FO300016398	Fucking brain eater!
FO300016399	You bigot! Take your sweaty carcass elsewhere.
FO300016400	Do you have any traders in town? Any doctors?
FO300016401	We've got two things to do in this town: suck and die. No one ever makes it in this place. You won't find any stores to loot here.
FO300016402	Now that Red's here, she'll open the clinic back up. Bother her.
FO300016403	Do you have any traders in town? Any doctors?
FO300016404	No. Red used to run a medical clinic, but Super Mutants captured her in the last attack.
FO300016405	There aren't many of us left to run stores or anything like that. You could stop by Red's clinic if you need stitching up.
FO300016406	Look, the only place to go is the town hall, and that's just a meeting spot for us. There aren't any traders or anything around here.
FO300016407	Red's back, so she's running the clinic again. I go there all the time. Get my wounds treated from fighting. Yeah.
FO300016408	I wander around town to find chalk and makeup sometimes. Not like there's anyplace to buy stuff.
FO300016409	What's there to do around here, Bittercup?
FO300016410	Red's clinic has some sharp knives and lighters. Too bad Red is always there, helping "these" people.
FO300016411	What's there to do around here, Bittercup?
FO300016412	I guess adults don't go to stores that much. That must be why there isn't anything here. Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
FO300016413	This is a town, right? Where are the stores?
FO300016414	Yep. As long as you've still got the ass to sit down on, I can fix you up. I'm also in the market for medical supplies.
FO300016415	You're the doctor in town?
FO300016416	Hey, I'm not your personal tour guide! Besides, there's nothing to do in Big Town. Super Mutants tore everything apart.
FO300016417	If only Red were here, then there would be a doctor to go to. You'll just have to make do without.
FO300016418	What's there to do here, anyway?
FO300016419	Well, you've seen the clinic. Red's the smart one in Bigtown. I'd ask her.
FO300016420	Red should have been here, but she probably got dragged off by the mutants. Damn it! DAMN IT!
FO300016421	Red was the only one in town that dealt with outsiders. Now she's dead. Argh! It's so unfair! Damn it!
FO300016422	There's nothing here but the stench of death, and the threat of attack looming over every sunset.
FO300016423	The injured wind up in Red's Clinic. There's always so much red on the doctor, and it's not from her fabric.
FO300016424	There's nothing here but the stench of death, and the threat of attack looming over every sunset.
FO300016425	This place looks like a ghost town.
FO300016426	Yeah, you're telling me. Everything that could go wrong, goes wrong. The Super Mutants and Slavers seem to take turns beating the crap out of us.
FO300016427	There's no way for us to fight back, so we just keep building barricades around town.
FO300016428	Now we've been pushed back all the way. Nowhere left to run now.
FO300016429	Why do Super Mutants keep attacking the town?
FO300016430	Nah, no way. Bigtown is a great place to be! I bet I could live over there, in that building with all the bullet holes and burn marks. Cool!
FO300016431	Just ask everyone else in town. I'm sure they'll tell you how great it is to be here, all grownup!
FO300016432	Oh, just grand, can't you tell? People are always dying to visit here and bring back "souvenirs."
FO300016433	I used to pay off or trick the Slavers into leaving us alone. Not that it stops them much.
FO300016434	Those Mutants are the real problem. Too big to shoot down and too single-minded to outwit. They just keep coming.
FO300016435	How are things in Big Town, Red?
FO300016436	What do you think will happen to Big Town?
FO300016437	I remember screaming and gunfire. One of those big, hulking things shot at me. That's all I can think of.
FO300016438	Do you know anything about the Super Mutant attacks?
FO300016439	Two very angry types of movements. Slow, lumbering, powerful movements and jerky, erratic, excitable movements. Both coming for the kill.
FO300016440	What are you on the lookout for?
FO300016441	Where did you people come from, anyway?
FO300016442	Most of us came from Little Lamplight. We got too old, so they kicked us out. Brats.
FO300016443	Always heard stories about how great Big Town was, where the grownups go. But there's nothing here except death and sand.
FO300016444	Oh, Little Lamplight is where most of us came from. Red and Pappy and Flash and Bittercup. We used to play together, when we were kids.
FO300016445	Then we got old, and we had to leave. Those are the rules. So we packed up and headed here, like we were supposed to.
FO300016446	We all used to live in a place called Little Lamplight, but they have a rule about age. You reach sixteen, and you're out.
FO300016447	Didn't matter, though, because you'd just pack your things and head to Bigtown. All the adults go there, and there's plenty to eat.
FO300016448	"Plenty to eat" alright, if you like eating bullets. I've lost count of how many times I've been shot at.
FO300016449	Whoa, that was a long time ago. I'm not sure when, but everyone who grows up in Lamplight ends up here. Not too many of us left.
FO300016450	Tell me how Big Town got started.
FO300016451	Bigtown? A fairy-tale really. The Lamplighters who turn sixteen aren't allowed to stay in the caves, but they have to go somewhere.
FO300016452	And to encourage people to leave, they invented Bigtown: the "great grownup place" that you got to go to when you became an adult.
FO300016453	I think you can see how true those stories were.
FO300016454	Give me the history of this place.
FO300016455	From the look of things, I'd say a Super Mutant sat down in a ditch one day and shat out this town.
FO300016456	I dragged myself here from Lamplight. I didn't believe all the stories about Bigtown, but I wasn't about to let everyone else go there without me.
FO300016457	A few dozen attacks on the town later, and here I am. Almost an ingredient in a Super Mutant chile cook-off.
FO300016458	Do you know how Big Town got started?
FO300016459	Well, I don't know. I guess the grownups built it when they got sick of little brats always hanging around them. I bet that's it!
FO300016460	Any idea why there are barricades surrounding the town?
FO300016461	Sometimes you'll see small, tired dots on the horizon instead of angry, anxious ones. Those are settlers who come here from Lamplight. Poor fools.
FO300016462	How did you people get here?
FO300016463	Whoa, take it easy. I was just asking.
FO300016464	I'm just saying, it's an option.
FO300016465	No. It isn't. Not to me.
FO300016466	You let a dying man use supplies you need? You're a bunch of morons.
FO300016467	Maybe. But I'd rather die as a moron who cares for my friends than be a heartless jerk like you.
FO300016468	Let's talk about something else.
FO300016469	Yeah. Let's do that.
FO300016470	Why keep him alive? Don't you need the supplies you're using on him?
FO300016471	Maybe I can help him.
FO300016472	Maybe you can. Feel free to take a look at him. But don't get in over your head. He's got some pretty nasty injuries.
FO300016473	I doubt it. I've dealt with dozens of battlefield injuries at this point, and the best I've been able to do is keep him knocked out.
FO300016474	Who's that guy in the clinic?
FO300016475	I told you, that's Timebomb. And if it were up to you, he'd be dead. Just stay away from him.
FO300016476	That's Timebomb. He got lucky. During the last raid, the mutant shot him down in the street.
FO300016477	Normally, they go for the kill, but I managed to drag Timebomb away before they could get they killing blow in.
FO300016478	I dragged him back to the clinic, but his injuries are way beyond what I can deal with. Honestly, there's not much hope for him.
FO300016479	That's Timebomb. He got lucky. During the last raid, the mutant shot him down in the street.
FO300016480	Normally, they go for the kill, but I managed to drag Timebomb away before they could get they killing blow in.
FO300016481	I dragged him back to the clinic, but his injuries are way beyond what I can deal with. Honestly, there's not much hope for him.
FO300016482	Who's that guy over there? Is he hurt?
FO300016483	I have a Fission Battery that will fix that express elevator.
FO300016484	Great. Now get it hooked up to the elevator so we can get out of here.
FO300016485	Fantastic! Get that over to Donovan right away.
FO300016486	As soon as he gets it up and running make a break for it.
FO300016487	Remember our rally point is our H.Q., Ranger Compound. Don't stop for anything!
FO300016488	Let me have that thing. Give me a few minutes, and I'll have the elevator up and running.
FO300016489	As soon as I get it online, we'll get out of here.
FO300016490	Well, what the fuck you bringin' it to me for? Get it plugged into the elevator!
FO300016491	Well, what the fuck you bringin' it to me for? Give to to Donovan. Sheesh.
FO300016492	Why don't one of you come with me?
FO300016493	I can't allow that to happen. Nothing personal.
FO300016494	If any of us goes down, don't stop. Get the hell out of here and make for our H.Q., Ranger Compound.
FO300016495	Okay, I'll go back and look for the Fission Battery.
FO300016496	All right. We'll hold the roof position here.
FO300016497	If any of us goes down, don't stop. Get the hell out of here and make for our H.Q., Ranger Compound.
FO300016498	Are there any other ways off this roof?
FO300016499	Well, I can think of a faster way, but I doubt you'd survive the fall.
FO300016500	Doesn't look like the elevator works anymore.
FO300016501	You're right. What we need is something to power the elevator motor up here and get the thing going.
FO300016502	On the way up here, I'm pretty certain we passed a maintenance room. Inside was a wrecked Protectron.
FO300016503	If you can get me its fission battery, I can have Donovan jury-rig the elevator.
FO300016504	Okay, fine. Yes, she's alive. She's safe in Underworld. Satisfied?
FO300016505	Yes, very. Now let's talk about getting the hell off of this roof.
FO300016506	I would have proposed going back the way you came, but apparently it's impossible now.
FO300016507	So, the express elevator is our only solution.
FO300016508	We'll chat about stuff later. We have to get out of here, right now!
FO300016509	Listen. I don't know who you are. I don't even know why Reilly sent you. One thing I do know is that you're beginning to piss me off.
FO300016510	Now, stopping being an asshole and work with me, will ya?
FO300016511	Who put you in charge?
FO300016512	Reilly did. I'm the second in command of the Rangers. Now, can you just answer the question?
FO300016513	Any clue where I can find a Fission Battery?
FO300016514	Hmmmm. Not really. All I remember is passing that maintenance office on the third floor.
FO300016515	Sorry, we were under fire the whole time. Otherwise, I would have cleaned the place out.
FO300016516	When we passed the maintenance room, I spied a deactivated Protectron inside. Just wrench open its access panel and you'll find it.
FO300016517	All I remember is mowing down Super Mutants with Eugene here.
FO300016518	How have you guys survived up here?
FO300016519	I'd say it was a whole lot of luck. We set as many traps as we could behind us and killed as many Super Mutants as possible.
FO300016520	Being able to fend off the last wave of them made the rest more cautious, but it also drained our ammo.
FO300016521	It's only a matter of time before they rally, especially since you punched through their lines.
FO300016522	Skill baby, pure skill. And my big-ass gun!
FO300016523	By the seat of our pants. We are out of everything. Ammo, food and time.
FO300016524	I have no idea how we've made it this long, but damn I am glad you got up here.
FO300016525	Who are those girls? And where are their clothes?
FO300016526	Ha ha! They're my party girls.
FO300016527	I'm too much man for just one woman, so I need two! I wear them out every night.
FO300016528	Why should they bother getting dressed when I'm just going to take it off?
FO300016529	Ha ha! Cherry is my play toy.
FO300016530	I love my Cherry pie! Love it all night long!
FO300016531	I like her half naked. I like her all naked, but she says she gets cold.
FO300016532	Who's that girl? And why isn't she dressed?
FO300016533	She makes all my fantasies come true. Ha ha!
FO300016534	That's my favorite outfit. If she gets cold, old Dukov knows how to warm her up!
FO300016535	That girl looks cold. Why isn't she dressed?
FO300016536	Hey! Watch your language, clown shoes.
FO300016537	I don't pay them. They take care of me, so I take care of them. We rub each other wrong all night long! Ha, ha!
FO300016538	Hey! Watch you language, clown shoes.
FO300016539	I take care of her, so she takes care of me. Ha, ha! She rubs me wrong all night long. Ha, ha!
FO300016540	Not yet, but I'm working on it.
FO300016541	Well? what are you waiting for?
FO300016542	Allistair Tenpenny is dead. One shot, right through the brain.
FO300016543	What! I hired you to kill him! I want him dead! You double crossed me.
FO300016544	I won't get into a bidding war with him. I'll lose.
FO300016545	Guess I've got to kill you now.
FO300016546	I've decided not to kill Tenpenny. He made me a better offer.
FO300016547	Yes, yes, yes! Another bigot bites the dust.
FO300016548	Good riddance. The wasteland is better off without him.
FO300016549	Allistair Tenpenny is dead, but not from a shot to the head.
FO300016550	I've reconsidered your offer. I'll kill those Ghoul-hating bigots for you.
FO300016551	Excellent! Okay, here's a list of the guys and their last known locations.
FO300016552	Oh, and I'll need some proof. Word will get around about Tenpenny, so don't worry about him.
FO300016553	For each one you bring me, I'll pay you 25 caps. If they die from a shot to the head, I'll make it 100 caps.
FO300016554	TranqLaneTalk1
FO300016555	Hey, aren't you the one who said we shouldn't call her that? That we should show a little respect to the elderly?
FO300016556	"Old Lady Dithers"? I thought you were the one who said we should be nice, and refer to her as "Ms. Dithers".
FO300016557	Oh, stop it. You know I don't trust that woman one bit.
FO300016558	George, honestly. You know I don't like talking to her.
FO300016559	Mabel, I meant to ask you. Have you seen the new RobCo catalog? I thought you might be interested, since you don't seem to like your Mr. Handy.
FO300016560	Oh, Mabel. Did you want to look for a new robot? I know you're not comfortable with yours.
FO300016561	Timmy Neusbaum left his roller skates in my house again. How many times have I talked to Pat about that?
FO300016562	I'm annoyed, Martha. Timmy left his roller skates in my house again. He needs to learn to pick up after himself.
FO300016563	Should I invite the Neusbaums over for Bridge, or will you be down in the basement all night again?
FO300016564	Hi, Roger. Are you planning on spending the evening down in the basement again?
FO300016565	Good day to you, sir! Everything going well at home?
FO300016566	Hi, Roger. How are you? And how's that wife of yours?
FO300016567	Why, hello there.
FO300016568	What's the good word?
FO300016569	Hello there.
FO300016570	What's going on?
FO300016571	How are you today?
FO300016572	TranqLaneTalk2
FO300016573	It's not funny, George. I'm not joking around.
FO300016574	That's not the point and you know it. Don't try and change the subject.
FO300016575	Pat, you know as well as I do that she's where most of our news comes from, one way or another.
FO300016576	Suddenly you don't have an interest in hearing what's going on in town? I find that hard to believe.
FO300016577	No, no. I don't like robots. Don't like the one I have, and don't want a new one. If I didn't rely on the thing so much, I'd just get rid of it.
FO300016578	I suppose so. I haven't really noticed.
FO300016579	Well that's not safe, is it? Someone could really get hurt. It's a shame Pat doesn't teach him to be more responsible.
FO300016580	Oh dear. Someone could really get hurt. You'd think Pat would have talked to him about it.
FO300016581	Oh, things are great. Just great. Really.
FO300016582	TranqLaneTalk3
FO300016583	Yes, dear. Sorry. Is there a problem?
FO300016584	Okay, okay. Sorry. What's the problem now?
FO300016585	Well I'm not going to go running off to hear what she has to say today. Now find something useful to do.
FO300016586	I don't have to like that she's such a busybody, do I? Now leave me alone about it.
FO300016587	Roger and Janet seem to be getting along better, don't you think?
FO300016588	So, what do you think of the Rockwells? Seems like things are better between the two of them now.
FO300016589	You know there's nothing to worry about, right? It's perfectly safe. They build them so they won't ever hurt their owners.
FO300016590	Really, Mabel. It's fine. There's no reason to feel uncomfortable. It's just another machine.
FO300016591	I really wish Pat would do something about it. He's a nice boy, but he's just so messy.
FO300016592	I don't even know if it's worth trying to talk to Pat. Maybe when she steps on one of his toys and breaks her neck, she'll do something about it.
FO300016593	Good to hear. I'm glad the two of you are doing well, after everything you've been through.
FO300016594	That's good. We were worried about you two for a while. You deserve to be happy.
FO300016595	Bet the Commies in China wish they had it as good as we do, eh?
FO300016596	Makes you proud to be an American, doesn't it.
FO300016597	It's one of the great things about living here.
FO300016598	She's been talking to Timmy again. I want him to stay away from her. She's nuts, and she shouldn't be anywhere near him.
FO300016599	I saw Timmy talking to her again. I don't want him near her, George. She's crazy, and I don't want it influencing him. You need to say something.
FO300016600	Ha ha. All right, dear.
FO300016601	Okay, okay! Just having a little fun.
FO300016602	Well, maybe you feel that way. I really don't like it. What if something goes wrong?
FO300016603	Just the same, I don't trust it. I swear it watches me sometimes.
FO300016604	Well, I know I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.
FO300016605	I'm certainly grateful for everything we have.
FO300016606	It's a great time to be alive, isn't it?
FO300016607	TranqLaneTalk5
FO300016608	Okay, sorry for bringing it up.
FO300016609	Okay, I'll have another chat with him about it. I'm sure he was only being polite.
FO300016610	Oh Mabel, you worry too much. It's fine.
FO300016611	It's perfectly safe, I'm sure. Everyone here has one, and no one's ever had a problem.
FO300016612	I see. Well, I thought you might have some insight. If you notice anything, or want to talk about it, you let me know, okay?
FO300016613	But you could leave the Vault, find somewhere else to live.
FO300016614	Are you mad? I've been here for almost 200 years. My body is in no condition to be used for anything.
FO300016615	And yet here in Tranquility Lane, I am as strong and youthful as I care to be. No, no. I think I'll stay here, thank you.
FO300016616	I'm afraid you're not in a position to decide what they do or do not deserve. They are under my control, not yours.
FO300016617	Now if you're done attempting to change my mind, let's get on with your final task. After completing it, you will be free to go.
FO300016618	Why are you doing all of this?
FO300016619	Because I can, of course.
FO300016620	I have total power here. I may do whatever I wish, and over these many years I have found that I wish to see others suffer.
FO300016621	Here, I brought you some ammo.
FO300016622	Oh, HELL yeah!
FO300016623	Hey, kid. This bad boy spits out lead like there's no tomorrow. So unless you have at least 150 rounds, I can't even fill it up.
FO300016624	Whew. That makes me feel a whole lot better. Thanks.
FO300016625	Look, unless you have at least 50 shots of 10mm on you, I may as well go with my pistol.
FO300016626	Thanks. I was starting to feel a little naked without it.
FO300016627	Wonderful. What the hell am I going to do with less than 50 shots? That barely fills this puppy up. Come on, kid.
FO300016628	Well, since I saved your ass, shouldn't you be joining me?
FO300016629	That's a nice attitude, man. No need to be a dick.
FO300016630	Just forget I said anything.
FO300016631	That would be great. Maybe I'll speak to Reilly about it.
FO300016632	You should. Now that our group is smaller, I'm sure she'll be into adding another Ranger to our ranks.
FO300016633	Anyway, we gotta' split. Oh, if you ever make your way to our headquarters, look me up if you need something fixed. I'd be glad to cut you a deal.
FO300016634	Nah. I've got things to do. But thanks for the compliment.
FO300016635	Okay, just wanted you to know that I got your back if we ever end up in a firefight again. Anyway, we gotta' split.
FO300016636	Oh, if you ever make your way to our headquarters, look me up if you need something fixed. I'd be glad to cut you a deal.
FO300016637	Wow, you're certifiably insane, huh?
FO300016638	Last guy who said something like that to me took a long dirt nap. Catch my drift?
FO300016639	Hahahaha! Oh, I loved watching you sweat there for a second. Damn right I'm crazy! Isn't that right, Eugene?
FO300016640	Anyway, you look me up if you ever want to get into a fight. I'll be sure and bring the thunder. Ha ha ha!
FO300016641	Has anyone ever spoken to you about anger management?
FO300016642	Well, someone did once, and I swear I let them leave only with a slight limp.
FO300016643	Don't worry, I'm on your side!
FO300016644	Anyway, you look me up if you ever want to get into a fight. I'll be sure and bring the thunder. Ha ha ha!
FO300016645	You bet your ass I did! Did you see that Super Mutant's head burst? Beautiful!
FO300016646	Me and Eugene, we got a partnership. I find targets, and he vaporizes targets. It works out well.
FO300016647	Anyway, you look me up if you ever want to get into a fight. I'll be sure and bring the thunder. Ha ha ha!
FO300016648	My Dad can't have left. The door is sealed shut.
FO300016649	My Dad can't have really left the Vault. That's impossible.
FO300016650	That's what I would have said until tonight. But it's true. He's gone and Jonas is dead and now they're looking for you!
FO300016651	That's what I would have said until tonight. But it's true. He's gone and Jonas is dead and now they're looking for you!
FO300016652	What? Jonas is dead? What the hell is going on?
FO300016653	I thought so too. But it's true. He's gone and Jonas is dead and now they're looking for you!
FO300016654	Awwww, isn't that a shame? My heart's bleeding. Really.
FO300016655	Sure did. And now you're all alone.
FO300016656	Looks like you're stuck here all alone. How does that feel?
FO300016657	I put these people out of their misery. You're getting exactly what you deserve.
FO300016658	You've taken them all from me. You've left me with nothing!
FO300016659	There's a pack of Feral Ghouls in the courtyard!
FO300016660	Shit! Thanks for the intel. I've gotta go.
FO300016661	I want more than that to spare your miserable life. 300 caps.
FO300016662	You mercenaries are so reliably predictable.
FO300016663	100 now, 200 when the job is done.
FO300016664	I think it would be better for everyone if I just killed you.
FO300016665	An honest mercenary? Who would have thought. Guards!
FO300016666	200 caps to spare your life? Okay.
FO300016667	I love mercenaries. They're so easy to buy.
FO300016668	You'll be paid after I know he's dead. And believe me, I'll know.
FO300016669	You've satisfied my curiosity.
FO300016670	So easily? Somehow I'm not surprised.
FO300016671	How did he die?
FO300016672	Who cares? I hired some mercenaries to get me some equipment from Fort Constantine. He was one of them.
FO300016673	Of the five, only three survived. You'll have to ask one of them if you want the gory details.
FO300016674	Mister Crowley is alive. I'm here to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
FO300016675	He's alive? I should have known. It's hard to kill those zombies. You gotta shoot 'em in the head.
FO300016676	Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it.
FO300016677	No way. I'm going to keep those keys for myself.
FO300016678	What! You bastard, I'll kill you!
FO300016679	More caps? You've got a deal.
FO300016680	Good. Oh, and I still want Tenpenny dead. That bastard really does hate Ghouls.
FO300016681	Good. Just get me those keys.
FO300016682	Those people you sent me to kill aren't Ghoul haters...
FO300016683	You weren't supposed to talk to them! You were just supposed to kill them!
FO300016684	Okay. Okay. All I really want are those security keys. Killing them is just a bonus.
FO300016685	Just get me the keys, and I'll still pay you. I'll even throw in a hundred cap bonus. Deal?
FO300016686	You're a nosy little bastard, aren't you?
FO300016687	It's true. Tenpenny is a bigot, but the others aren't. All I want are those keys.
FO300016688	Just bring me the keys and I'll give you the full price anyway. How about an extra hundred caps to seal the new deal?
FO300016689	You're a little slow, aren't ya?
FO300016690	Tenpenny is a bigot, but the others aren't. All I really want are those keys.
FO300016691	Just bring me the keys and I'll give you the full price anyway.
FO300016692	The day isn't complete until I've killed something.
FO300016693	Well aren't you the bloodthirsty type?
FO300016694	I've got this list of people. Ghoul bigots. Real scum.
FO300016695	I've only got four guys left on the list. Started out with eleven. All of them hate Ghouls and treat us like we're zombies.
FO300016696	They all deserve to die. But it has to be done with a head shot. Just like the old stories where zombies can only be killed that way.
FO300016697	I'll pay you 100 caps for each one, 25 if they die some other way.
FO300016698	Okay. Just don't hang around the fence. President Daddy's guards don't like that.
FO300016699	I think I'd like to meet Dave.
FO300016700	Okay, I'll take you, but President Daddy doesn't always like new people.
FO300016701	OK, this way.
FO300016702	Okay, I'll take you, but President Daddy doesn't always like new people.
FO300016703	Okay, come with me.
FO300016704	Okay, I'll take you, but President Daddy doesn't always like new people.
FO300016705	Okay, follow me.
FO300016706	Okay, I'll take you, but President Daddy doesn't always like new people.
FO300016707	I'm just a wanderer. I'll be going now.
FO300016708	Strangers need to stay outside or get permission from President Daddy! Else the Army of Dave will shoot you!
FO300016709	Your Republic is forfeit. Prepare to be reclaimed by the Wasteland!
FO300016710	Communist! She's a Communist! Everyone come quick!
FO300016711	Communist! He's a Communist! Everyone come quick!
FO300016712	Daddy Dave! Help us! Please!
FO300016713	Dave! Dave!
FO300016714	Get Daddy Dave! Invader! Invader!
FO300016715	Someone help! Invader! Invader!
FO300016716	Let's see what the Army of Dave has to say about that, invader!
FO300016717	I'm not here to hurt anyone. What is this place?
FO300016718	This is the Republic of Dave, duh! It's named for President Daddy! But you have to talk to him if you want to stay here.
FO300016719	We're the Republic of Dave. Or we used to be anyway.  You have to go now.  Dave isn't here anymore to talk to you.
FO300016720	A gift of the key would be a strategic diplomatic move, Mister President.
FO300016721	Hmm. Of course it would. I knew that. I was just testing you to see if you would realize it.
FO300016722	Here, take the key. It is a gift from the Republic of Dave to the Wasteland.
FO300016723	Hmm. Of course it would. I knew that. I was just testing you to see if you would realize it.
FO300016724	Here, take this key. It is a gift from the Republic of Dave to the Wasteland.
FO300016725	A gift would be a strategic diplomatic move, Mr. President. Something personal.
FO300016726	Not good enough, Mister President.
FO300016727	Of course, of course. I should have you killed, but that would be boring.
FO300016728	How did Mister Crowley die, Mister President?
FO300016729	When the Feral Ghouls killed Tara, Dukov realized that he would get more of the commission.
FO300016730	He decided to kill off the rest of us too. He locked Crowley into a room with Feral Ghouls, and that was the last we saw of him.
FO300016731	Strayer and I didn't trust Dukov after that. The three of us finished the mission together, but with guns drawn.
FO300016732	Mister Crowley is alive. He sent me to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
FO300016733	Me? Hate Ghouls? Preposterous.
FO300016734	Wait. You said you're here to kill me? I'm going to have to recind your diplomatic immunity.
FO300016735	Then I'm going to execute you.
FO300016736	Wait. I've changed my mind. You have one hour to leave the Republic. Then I'll execute you.
FO300016737	Crowley is alive, Mister President. I'm supposed to bring him the key.
FO300016738	Alive? I always wondered. He was locked in with a bunch of Feral Ghouls. They won't attack Ghouls, you see.
FO300016739	The key is part of the Republic of Dave treasury. I couldn't possibly part with it.
FO300016740	Alive? I always wondered. He was locked in with a bunch of Feral Ghouls. They won't attack Ghouls, you see.
FO300016741	Would you consider taking him a personal item, like this key, and just telling him you killed me?
FO300016742	Crowley is alive, Mr. President. I'm supposed to bring back proof of your death.
FO300016743	What happened in the Fort, Mister President?
FO300016744	Two of us died, including Crowley. The rest achieved the mission goals and were paid.
FO300016745	Thank you for sharing your wisdom, Mister President.
FO300016746	It is such a burden being the wisest.
FO300016747	I hope these scraps of wisdom make your life better.
FO300016748	I seek citizenship in the Republic of Dave.
FO300016749	First off, you will address me as Mister President. Always. No exceptions.
FO300016750	Secondly, after careful consideration, the Office of Immigrant Affairs reports that we've already exceeded our quota for immigration this year.
FO300016751	Appication denied. You have 24 hours to leave the Republic, or face deportation.
FO300016752	I am seeking asylum, Mister President.
FO300016753	I'll agree to harbor you for now. However, in exchange, you will reveal the secrets of your former nation to me or face exile.
FO300016754	I'm just a traveler. I guess you could say I'm vacationing.
FO300016755	The Department of Tourist Rights has declared a tourism embargo that affects the entirety of the Republic of Dave.
FO300016756	You have 24 hours to return to your home nation or face "accelerated" deportation.
FO300016757	Most exalted President Dave, I am an ambassador from the Wasteland.
FO300016758	You are? Excellent. It's good to see that the Wasteland has finally recognized the sovereign Republic of Dave.
FO300016759	If the people of the Wasteland are generous and respectful, I might deign to annex them.
FO300016760	Sounds simple enough.
FO300016761	Then get going.
FO300016762	Hey, what about my damn reward?
FO300016763	Are you out of your fucking mind? Reward? If you had some sort of a deal going with Butcher, then that was between you and him.
FO300016764	I'm guessing the deal was get them off that roof. They're all dead, so I don't see that as a success.
FO300016765	Now get the hell out of my sight!
FO300016766	Are you out of your fucking mind?
FO300016767	Now get the hell out of my sight!
FO300016768	What about my reward?
FO300016769	Reward? If you had some sort of a deal going with Butcher, then that was between you and him.
FO300016770	I'm guessing the deal was get them off that roof. They're all dead, so I don't see that as a success.
FO300016771	Reward? The deal was get my men off that roof. They're all dead, so I don't see that as a success.
FO300016772	I don't know how you normally deal with mercs, but we stick to our deals. You couldn't hold up your end of it, so there's no reward.
FO300016773	Yeah, please. I have much to do.
FO300016774	Okay, but at least let me thank you for all you've done. You could have been killed trying to save my men.
FO300016775	So, for your reward, what'll it be? The Ranger Battlearmor or one of Brick's Miniguns?
FO300016776	Losing a bit of the merc edge, eh? Don't get soft on me now!
FO300016777	Well, I've said it once but I'll say it again. You have my thanks. I'd be pretty lost without my guys.
FO300016778	So, for your reward, what'll it be? The Ranger Battlearmor or one of Brick's Miniguns?
FO300016779	I'm sorry, I think I need to be alone. Could you excuse me?
FO300016780	I'm sorry we lost Butcher and Donavan.
FO300016781	I was afraid that might happen. I should never have left them up there alone. Now their deaths rest on my shoulders.
FO300016782	I'm sure you're more interested in your reward than listening to me talk, so let me get right to it.
FO300016783	I'm sorry we lost Brick and Donavan.
FO300016784	I was afraid that might happen. I should never have left them up there alone. Now their deaths rest on my shoulders.
FO300016785	I'm sure you're more interested in your reward than listening to me talk, so let me get right to it.
FO300016786	I'm sorry we lost Brick and Butcher.
FO300016787	I was afraid that might happen. I should never have left them up there alone. Now their deaths rest on my shoulders.
FO300016788	I'm sure you're more interested in your reward than listening to me talk, so let me get right to it.
FO300016789	I'm sorry we lost Donovan.
FO300016790	Yeah, Donovan was a good man. Ah well, at least the others made it.
FO300016791	I'm sure you're more interested in your reward than listening to me talk, so let me get right to it.
FO300016792	I'm sorry we lost Butcher.
FO300016793	Yeah, Butcher was a good man. Ah well, at least the others made it.
FO300016794	I'm sure you're more interested in your reward than listening to me talk, so let me get right to it.
FO300016795	I'm sorry we lost Brick.
FO300016796	I'm sure you're more interested in your reward than listening to me talk, so let me get right to it.
FO300016797	It went extremely well, as you can see. We didn't lose anyone.
FO300016798	I'm very impressed at your skill. I don't think I've come across someone quite like you in the ruins.
FO300016799	I suppose I owe you a debt, and I intend to pay it in kind.
FO300016800	I'm sure you're more interested in your reward than listening to me talk, so let me get right to it.
FO300016801	Yeah. That was a tough run.
FO300016802	I bet it was. Frankly, I'm amazed you made it.
FO300016803	Can you give me a full debriefing on what happened out there with my men?
FO300016804	Nah. It was all in a day's work.
FO300016805	You're a cocky little thing, aren't you? I like that.
FO300016806	Well, as much as I want to hear all about it, can you tell me a full debrief on what happened out there with my men?
FO300016807	CherryQuit
FO300016808	You're a goddamn liar. You told me we were going to Rivet City but we've been out here for over five days! I've had it. I'm going back.
FO300016809	No. It's going to be a while before I go to Rivet City.
FO300016810	Screw it then. I'm not wandering the Wasteland with you.
FO300016811	Rivet City it is.
FO300016812	Let me pack my bags. Oh, wait, I don't have any. Lets get out of here.
FO300016813	If he's that bad, come with me. I'll protect you.
FO300016814	Okay. Rivet City has got to be better than this.
FO300016815	I have my hands in his pants all the time. He probably won't even notice it's gone.
FO300016816	Dukov has a special key. Get it for me and I'll take you to Rivet City.
FO300016817	Only if you take me to Rivet City.
FO300016818	Anywhere else and I'll just end up being someone else's property.
FO300016819	You should come with me. You can't survive here by yourself.
FO300016820	Only if you take me to Rivet City.
FO300016821	And don't think I'm going to give you the same privileges I give Dukov. You and I are sleeping separate.
FO300016822	Only if you take me to Rivet City.
FO300016823	This guy is an animal. And not in a good way. But I'm safe here.
FO300016824	Thanks for the warning.
FO300016825	Right. Because I've got all kinds of survival skills.
FO300016826	I've only got one skill, and it won't do me any fucking good here.
FO300016827	Go on. Get out of here.
FO300016828	I'm sure you can find a way to survive here.
FO300016829	No sweat.
FO300016830	Does he pay you for this?
FO300016831	Of course. Why else would I stay with the old fart? You don't think I actually love that bastard, do you?
FO300016832	He gives me some caps, but it's not what you think. He can be a nice guy.
FO300016833	And when the lights go out, he's real fun!
FO300016834	Why aren't you dressed?
FO300016835	Dukov likes to keep it hot. Ain't no need for nothin' else.
FO300016836	Dukov liked to keep it hot. He always said there ain't no need for nothin' else.
FO300016837	Dukey doesn't like me to wear a lot. He says it slows things down.
FO300016838	Who are you? And why are you dressed like that?
FO300016839	Dukey didn't like me to wear a lot. He said it slowed things down.
FO300016840	Who are you? And why are you dressed like that?
FO300016841	So what's the deal with Dukov?
FO300016842	He's a lecherous old man. The only reason I put up with him and his "needs" is because I'm safe here.
FO300016843	He tends to shoot first and ask questions later. Don't pull out a weapon near him. He's likely to shoot you.
FO300016844	And he's really good.
FO300016845	He's all right. He can be a real fun guy, but he sure knows how to wear a girl out.
FO300016846	Most of all, I'm safe here. I wouldn't pull out a weapon, even just to show him. He gets kind of paranoid about that.
FO300016847	Don't get in a shooting match with him. He's really good.
FO300016848	What's this Dukov guy like?
FO300016849	Let these people go. There's no reason to keep them here.
FO300016850	Oh, but there is! They continue to amuse me. That is purpose enough for their lives, don't you think?
FO300016851	You are serving the same purpose after all. I do enjoy having someone new to play with. And speaking of playing, let's try a new game.
FO300016852	You don't need to stay here. You can live in the real world again.
FO300016853	The "real world'"? Ha ha ha.
FO300016854	This world is more real than anything outside.
FO300016855	My body has been seated in the same chair for 200 years. It's sustained by machines.
FO300016856	Were I to so much as stand up, my body would crumble to dust. But here, I've moved beyond that frail physical form. I am so much MORE here.
FO300016857	And now our little diversion is at an end. It's time you do something else for me.
FO300016858	Why haven't you left after all this time?
FO300016859	I have no desire to leave. Here I wield more power than I could ever hope to in the outside world.
FO300016860	And I use that power to amuse myself. Now, for instance, you will do as I ask yet again because I have power over you.
FO300016861	How do I know you're not lying to me? Maybe you haven't seen him at all.
FO300016862	Oh dear, now you don't even believe me? How disappointing.
FO300016863	I assure you, James and I talked at length before you arrived. Now let's continue before I grow bored with you.
FO300016864	Enough games! Take me to him now!
FO300016865	No, I don't think I'll do that. I'm having far too much fun to stop now.
FO300016866	What I will do, however, is consider releasing both of you once you've done a few more things for me. So let's get to it.
FO300016867	I want to see him. Where is he?
FO300016868	If you continue to behave, and do as I ask, I may be willing to release both of you. But first you have work to do.
FO300016869	Don't worry, stud. I'll rock you all night long. First, I need another drink.
FO300016870	Dukey! You are so naughty. Later tonight I'll do something special for you.
FO300016871	Nonsense. You haven't had enough to drink. Hah ha!. Have another shot. That will settle your stomach.
FO300016872	Fantasia, you know I'm too much man for just one woman. I need both my playmates tonight! Hah ha!
FO300016873	We'd better not run out. I don't think I can do this sober.
FO300016874	I'll get you another drink in a minute, Dukey. Otherwise get it yourself.
FO300016875	Sure. It's my turn anyway. Not that he remembers, or cares.
FO300016876	That's what we do every night, Dukey. I'm starting to get a little tired of it.
FO300016877	Maybe next week, babe. We've got enough liquor to last for a while. That's the only thing that's important! Hah ha!
FO300016878	Fantasia, baby! You know you're my favorite. I need your special talents tonight. Hah ha!
FO300016879	I'm not agreeing to anything before you tell me what it is.
FO300016880	I'd like you to kill Mabel Henderson. Do something unique, something unexpected. Surprise me.
FO300016881	Fine. Let's just get this over with.
FO300016882	Oh, come now. Show some enthusiasm!
FO300016883	There are fewer rules this time. I'd like to see just what you're capable of.
FO300016884	I'd like you to kill Mabel Henderson. Please put some effort into it; do something creative. Beating her to death won't impress me.
FO300016885	Oh, great. I'm really looking forward to doing more for your amusement.
FO300016886	Your sarcasm is unappreciated. This could be so much fun if you'd allow yourself to see it.
FO300016887	Now, Mabel Henderson needs to die. Not just any death, mind you, but an entertaining, well thought-out death. You'll see to that.
FO300016888	Very simple. Plenty of opportunity to show me what you're capable of.
FO300016889	It's about time! What do I get to do?
FO300016890	Ah, now that's the spirit.
FO300016891	Let's raise the stakes. I'd like you to kill Mabel Henderson.
FO300016892	But do put some effort into it. Make it creative; beating her to death simply won't suffice.
FO300016893	Sounds like a great idea! I can't wait to help!
FO300016894	Good enthusiasm! Now, I think the first chapter will have to be about surviving day-to-day dangers.
FO300016895	Things like where it is and isn't safe to find food, the dangers of radiation, and how to avoid and even profit from dangerous landmines.
FO300016896	Ooh, sounds like fun, doesn't it? Which do you want to do first?
FO300016897	I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass. Sorry.
FO300016898	But, don't you like the idea? I mean, it's a good idea, right?
FO300016899	Well, I'll still be here if you change your mind. Plenty to work on without that book, anyway.
FO300016900	Hold on. I need to know more before I agree to anything.
FO300016901	Well, it's a dangerous place out there in the Wastes, right? People could really use a compilation of good advice. Like a Wasteland survival guide!
FO300016902	For that, I need an assistant to test my theories. I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt because of a mistake. Nobody's ever happy when that happens.
FO300016903	Well, food and medicine. Everyone needs them once in a while, right? So they need a good place to find them!
FO300016904	There's an old Super-Duper Mart not far from here. I need to know if a place like that still has any food or medicine left in it.
FO300016905	Getting food doesn't sound so bad. What are you looking for?
FO300016906	Mole Rats can burrow into almost anything and cause a lot of trouble. So I figured I'd make a chemical repellent stick for people to shoo them off.
FO300016907	But I need it to be tested before I put the recipe to paper in the guide. So I need you to find some Mole Rats and test it out a bit.
FO300016908	Tell me more about repelling the Mole Rats.
FO300016909	Don't be so sure. You'd be surprised how confused people get, even about important things.
FO300016910	In this case, I'm talking about Rivet City. It's the most successful survivor settlement around, but no one here really knows how it started.
FO300016911	Of course, that's why it's important to know how a place like that succeeded. So I need you to go there and do some researching!
FO300016912	Researching local history sounds easy.
FO300016913	Wait. How? I mean, how many people even read anymore?
FO300016914	Anyone who wants to learn from my Wasteland survival guide, that's who! And for that, I need a research assistant who can test my ideas for the book.
FO300016915	I mean, if our research is off, it could lead to horrific misinformation that causes the grisly and needless deaths of uncountable innocents.
FO300016916	But, you know, no pressure. So, will you help?
FO300016917	How's the book coming?
FO300016918	I'm still working out the kinks in the first chapter. I'm calling it, "Survive."
FO300016919	It's about dealing with the day-to-day needs out there. Finding food and water, avoiding hazards like radiation and traps. That sort of stuff.
FO300016920	Oh, I'm writing up the second chapter right now. It's called, "Thrive."
FO300016921	It covers the various ways to get ahead and stay ahead of the various predators out there. And how to patch yourself up if you don't!
FO300016922	In the last stretch, now! The last chapter's going to be called, "Revive."
FO300016923	It's all about how we can rebuild society and humanity, learning how to use old tech, preserving knowledge, building communities, and so on.
FO300016924	It's a little ambitious, yeah. But why aim low, right?
FO300016925	Oh, I've been doing a bit of research into ways to communicate with Centaurs. I mean, they should be able to talk, since they're mostly human.
FO300016926	I was considering a new way to make irradiated ground fertile again with some mixture of brahmin dung and crushed rad-away.
FO300016927	Of course, even if that works, the real problem would be irrigating the fields. And that'd require water.
FO300016928	I've been contemplating the possibilities of domesticating Mole Rats. I know it seems a little gross, but milk is milk and meat is meat, right?
FO300016929	I was playing with an idea for an elevated brahmin feeding system, so they don't have to strain their necks so much.
FO300016930	But the caravan master said, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
FO300016931	I guess that applies to improvements, too. Oh well.
FO300016932	Just taking care of business, as always.
FO300016933	Sorry, I can't really talk now. I've got lots of work to do. Lots of dull, dull work.
FO300016934	What do you do here?
FO300016935	Why, I'm an inventor, a tinkerer, and a general genius of junk. One person's junk is another's treasure, you know.
FO300016936	And traders bring in lots of junk, so I get dibs on anything particularly nifty. Sure, I don't have as much to sell, but it's more fun this way!
FO300016937	Moira Brown, inventor, tinkerer, and general genius of junk. One person's junk is another's treasure, you know.
FO300016938	My name's Moira Brown. I take care of basics around here. Nothing fancy.
FO300016939	I used to work on all sorts of things, but that seems like it was a long time ago.
FO300016940	So, how's the scavving been? Got the food and medicine from that Super-Duper Mart?
FO300016941	Oh? Feeling a bit under the weather? Or a bit over the Geiger-counter?
FO300016942	How are those hot little potatoes?
FO300016943	Anyway, what's up?
FO300016944	How are those hot little potatoes? Or whatever. You know what I mean.
FO300016945	Oh, I can't wait to hear how the repellent's working!
FO300016946	So, are they intelligent? Do they have a leader? Some sort of king? Or priests? Or some sort of scaly community center?
FO300016947	Well, how do you feel?
FO300016948	Any luck finding out how Rivet City got started?
FO300016949	Fiddle with any interesting technology, lately?
FO300016950	Is it there? Are there books? Can I go borrow some?
FO300016951	Oh. Well, could you get on that? Thanks!
FO300016952	I haven't gotten around to it, yet.
FO300016953	Not even for humanity? Not even for science?
FO300016954	I'm not really comfortable with getting irradiated.
FO300016955	It's not just because they say the place is haunted, is it? Because that's no reason to avoid the place.
FO300016956	Ghosts don't exist. But landmines do. Oh boy, do they. And that's what we need to study!
FO300016957	I haven't been to Minefield yet. Hold on.
FO300016958	Wow, it repels them that much? I can't wait for your full report!
FO300016959	I just haven't found enough Mole Rats.
FO300016960	There's only one way to know for sure. Just slip the observer into a spawning pod at the War Memorial. I'll take care of the rest.
FO300016961	I find this whole "Mirelurk intelligence" thing a bit hard to swallow.
FO300016962	You seriously want me to go out and hurt myself for your book?
FO300016963	Try asking around a bit. You never know who's collected a lot of information, do you?
FO300016964	I can't get a straight answer out of those folks.
FO300016965	Well, why not go over there and make a few friends? Or activate them, I guess.
FO300016966	I haven't been over to the RobCo facility, yet.
FO300016967	Places like that store the collected knowledge of the entire human race. How we began, how we lived, and how we died. Knowledge overwhelming!
FO300016968	I mean, no offense.
FO300016969	Is it really worth risking my life over a bunch of books?
FO300016970	Really? No medicine at all? None? Seriously? Well, I guess I should have expected that. It's been a long time, after all.
FO300016971	But you certainly did research a couple risks of those big stores. Tell me all about it!
FO300016972	Well, I've got the food. But no luck with the medicine.
FO300016973	So, let me do a little examination. How do you feel?
FO300016974	I don't feel well. I think I've got a bit of radiation sickness.
FO300016975	I'll bet you didn't see any ghosts, either. So, tell me about the landmines. Did you get blown up?
FO300016976	But sure, sniper, shooting, yadda, yadda, yadda. Tell me about the landmines. Did you get blown up?
FO300016977	I went in and got back, no problems.
FO300016978	See? I told you it wasn't a ghost. Science, one. Superstition, zero!
FO300016979	But sure, sniper, shooting, yadda, yadda, yadda. Tell me about the landmines. Did you get blown up?
FO300016980	I went in there and a sniper started shooting at me!
FO300016981	Just a few? Well, I'm sure it'll be good enough.
FO300016982	So, how did my chemical repellent work? Safe and clean like a charm, I'll bet!
FO300016983	I tested the Repellent on a few Mole Rats.
FO300016984	Oh, no. You didn't rile them up, did you? Because I'm not getting a very good signal from the observer.
FO300016985	I think they buried it in the mud. Oh, I really hope that was just mud.
FO300016986	Anyway, you saw them, at least a bit. What are your observations about them?
FO300016987	I set the observer, but I don't think they'll forget my visit anytime soon.
FO300016988	Well, lucky for you that I am! At least, pretty good. Good enough to fix this up, at least.
FO300016989	You wouldn't happen to have a broken limb, would you? No? Well, never mind. Now, can you describe how you feel?
FO300016990	You'd better be a good doctor.
FO300016991	Well, if it's all you could find out, I guess it'll have to do. So, what did they say?
FO300016992	I asked a couple people about Rivet City's history, but it may not be reliable.
FO300016993	Oh great! Reactivating long-dormant technology is definitely a good step towards the survival of humanity as a whole.
FO300016994	Then again, maybe it's more dangerous if it's active but uncontrolled. How did it turn out?
FO300016995	I was able to get the robots online again, but I couldn't control them.
FO300016996	Well... That's not really much use for the book, I'm afraid. But thanks for checking.
FO300016997	So, how's the place looking? How long before I can go over and borrow a couple good novels?
FO300016998	I found the library and checked the catalogue, but that's all I could get.
FO300016999	Really? You did? You did! Well, all right! Tell me all about it!
FO300017000	It wasn't easy, but I got the food and the medicine.
FO300017001	Now just hold on and try not to move. Tell me how it feels, and I'll get you fixed right up.
FO300017002	I'm about as irradiated as I can get without burning a hole in the floor.
FO300017003	My very own landmine! Just what I've always wanted. Well, always since I sent you out on this, anyway.
FO300017004	Now, tell me all about it. What was it like going through there? What's it like disarming a landmine?
FO300017005	I got through Minefield alive, and I even brought you a present.
FO300017006	Oh, excellent! Substantial field-testing, precise reports, and such dedication! What more could I ask for in a research assistant?
FO300017007	So, how did my chemical repellent work? Safe and clean like a charm, I'll bet!
FO300017008	I tested the Mole Rat repellent extensively.
FO300017009	I'll bet most people would have just gone in there, guns blazing, without half a thought. But not you! You're the best research assistant ever!
FO300017010	I've been getting a good signal, but what do you think about them from your first-hand observations of them?
FO300017011	I slipped the observer in with the eggs, and they're none the wiser.
FO300017012	Oh, I know it does, dear, but it's for a good cause. Try not to squirm so much while I take notes.
FO300017013	Now how would you describe the pain you're feeling? Any advice for how to keep it from being overwhelming? And remember, this is for posterity.
FO300017014	This really hurts, you know.
FO300017015	A-ha! Not just as easy as asking around, was it? Good information takes real work to uncover, after all.
FO300017016	So, tell me all about it!
FO300017017	After a lot of searching, I've got the real history of Rivet City.
FO300017018	Harnessing the technology of the past and modifying it for your own purposes? That's just the thing!
FO300017019	Tell me all about how it worked out!
FO300017020	I reactivated the robots and was able to modify their programming.
FO300017021	Really? A whole library's worth of data, right there? That's great news!
FO300017022	So, what did you find? Tell me about it!
FO300017023	The library's still standing, and I've got the archives right here.
FO300017024	Guess I wasn't the first to think of checking out a food store for storing food. Huh?
FO300017025	I encountered some Raiders, but they were easily outsmarted.
FO300017026	Well, it's no worse than some folks have it. Right?
FO300017027	Now, let me take a few notes, and I'll handle that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made rad-cure concoction.
FO300017028	The headaches certainly make it hard to focus properly.
FO300017029	Oh, I never get to discuss semantics with anyone anymore! People are always like, "No time to debate linguistic constructs, we need to get food."
FO300017030	But you're right, of course. And that sort of attention to detail must help when avoiding landmines.
FO300017031	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
FO300017032	Technically, it's the landmines that blow up, not me. And no, I didn't.
FO300017033	Explosive, you say? That's kind of impressive, actually. In a horrible sort of way, at least.
FO300017034	I guess it's back to the drawing board for that repellent. I wonder if I can make it into some sort of fuel. Anyway, I'll just take that.
FO300017035	You added too much chemical stimulant. The result was rather explosive.
FO300017036	I wish we could have gotten more information, but this'll have to do for the book. Here's your pay. Maybe they'll help you be sneakier next time.
FO300017037	Their lairs are partially aquatic, so the radiation must not bother them.
FO300017038	Sounds like you know your way around a medkit. You could probably take care of yourself, if I wasn't already here.
FO300017039	Of course, since I am here, I might as well take care of you now. It's the least I could do.
FO300017040	Acute physical trauma and severe lacerations. It's hardly pleasant.
FO300017041	Well, I suppose that sort of thing happens, occasionally. But I guess if that's all that can be uncovered, what else is there to go on?
FO300017042	Oh well. Still, for your help, have a few of these. They may help out next time you need to talk to a few folks.
FO300017043	There's simply too many stories, and not enough evidence to support any of them.
FO300017044	Say what you will about the dead folks of the past, but they designed a lot of their stuff so even idiots could use it. No offense, of course.
FO300017045	It helps to have the right tool for the job. Failing that, go with the right tool to cheat at the job. Like a pulse grenade. Here, have a couple.
FO300017046	Installation was much easier than reaching the mainframe in the first place.
FO300017047	Well, at least it's still there as a monument to knowledge. Shame it's an empty one.
FO300017048	Still, it's good to know it's standing. Maybe I'll inspire someone to take care of the place. Have some caps as payment for that little bit of hope.
FO300017049	The building is there, but the books are all ruined.
FO300017050	Oh, poor research assistant! I'm sorry, I didn't know it'd be so dangerous in there!
FO300017051	Well, don't worry. I'm sure the rest of the research will be safer!
FO300017052	That place was a death trap. It was crawling with Raiders.
FO300017053	Now, let me take a few notes, and I'll handle that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made rad-cure concoction.
FO300017054	Why don't you drink a tall glass of wastewater and find out for yourself?
FO300017055	I told you, ghosts don't exist. That sort of attitude really isn't benefiting a research assistant.
FO300017056	But I'm glad you're not dead. That'd be a real downer. Especially for you, I bet.
FO300017057	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
FO300017058	Yes, I blew up and died. Now I'm haunting you because of that stupid book. Boo.
FO300017059	I guess it's back to the drawing board for that repellent. I wonder if I can make it into some sort of fuel. Anyway, I'll just take that.
FO300017060	It repelled their limbs from their body. Can you make one that works on people?
FO300017061	I'm sure it's an acquired taste. I mean, it wouldn't technically be cannibalism or anything. Just kind of gross.
FO300017062	I wish we could have gotten more information, but this'll have to do for the book. Here's your pay. Maybe they'll help you be sneakier next time.
FO300017063	What's to say? They're crabs. They're delicious and nutritious.
FO300017064	Okay, okay! I'm sorry I even asked. Yeesh.
FO300017065	Well, rest easy and I'll see about fixing you up once I take a few notes.
FO300017066	On a scale of one to ten, I'd say it's a "shut the fuck up and fix me."
FO300017067	Even I'm not sure I can believe that, and I'm downright gullible. Or so I'm told.
FO300017068	But I guess if that's what they said, what else is there to go on?
FO300017069	Oh well. Still, for your help, have a few of these. They may help out next time you need to talk to a few folks.
FO300017070	I guess some people can work with complicated technology, and the actual tools and materials aren't entirely necessary.
FO300017071	I guess you've either got it or you don't.
FO300017072	It helps to have the right tool for the job. Failing that, go with the right tool to cheat at the job. Like a pulse grenade. Here, have a couple.
FO300017073	I didn't even need that tele-thingy unit. I was just that good. <Lie.>
FO300017074	I guess it's good enough just to know it's standing. Here's some caps for that. Jerk.
FO300017075	I may have been able to recover more, but it said to be quiet, so screw that.
FO300017076	That's a mighty callous attitude towards killing. But I guess they'd do the same for the food. Shame there wasn't any medicine.
FO300017077	I got the food and dealt with those pansy Raiders. They couldn't stop me.
FO300017078	More like radiation sickness can MAKE you weak. Don't blow it off like that.
FO300017079	Now, let me take a few notes, and I'll handle that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made rad-cure concoction.
FO300017080	I can barely feel it. Radiation sickness is for the weak.
FO300017081	But not exactly useful for those of us who can't handle even one little explosion.
FO300017082	I get blown up a lot. I get better. You got to be hard.
FO300017083	But it seemed to be working so well in informal testing! Anyone I hit with the repellent just left. Sometimes they yelled a bit, but that's all.
FO300017084	I guess it's back to the drawing board for that repellent. I wonder if I can make it into some sort of fuel. Anyway, I'll just take that.
FO300017085	Those dumb Mole Rats just blew up! You should have seen the guts!
FO300017086	Easier to avoid them than to fight them, you mean? Sounds like a good idea. Shame it's apparently hard to do in their den.
FO300017087	I wish we could have gotten more information, but this'll have to do for the book. Here's your pay. Maybe they'll help you be sneakier next time.
FO300017088	Between shells and scales, they're pretty tough. But not tough enough.
FO300017089	If you say so, tough stuff. Glad it's not me in your shoes.
FO300017090	Well, rest easy and I'll see about fixing you up once I take a few notes.
FO300017091	What, these little scratches? Hardly the worst scrape I've been in.
FO300017092	Whoa. From everything I had heard about them, I wouldn't have expected them to be so "hands-on."
FO300017093	But I guess if that's what they said, what else is there to go on?
FO300017094	Oh well. Still, for your help, have a few of these. They may help out next time you need to talk to a few folks.
FO300017095	Those tough upper deck folk built the whole place from the ground up!
FO300017096	It's a bit surprising how sturdy and easy-to-use a lot of the junked tech is. Guess they made it sturdy and simple back then.
FO300017097	It helps to have the right tool for the job. Failing that, go with the right tool to cheat at the job. Like a pulse grenade. Here, have a couple.
FO300017098	The unit went in the computer. Then the robots woke up. Pretty straightforward.
FO300017099	Well, I wouldn't think very highly of you. That's for sure.
FO300017100	Still, it's good to know it's standing. Maybe I'll inspire someone to take care of the place. Have some caps as payment for that little bit of hope.
FO300017101	Most of the books would make better burning than reading.
FO300017102	So, you're saying that they acquired a well-protected stash? I wonder how many other places are hiding treasures behind monsters, hrm?
FO300017103	Well, keep what you got. Just traded for a big food shipment, myself. Here, take a bit, my treat - the taste kind of grates after a while.
FO300017104	The Raiders were using the pharmacy as a place to store their best gear.
FO300017105	So, you're experiencing delusions, too? Fascinating!
FO300017106	Now, after taking a few notes, I'll take care of that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made concoction.
FO300017107	I've never had a chance to test it out on someone so heavily dosed, but I'm sure it'll work out fine. Exciting, isn't it?
FO300017108	If I listen closely, I can hear my genes crying.
FO300017109	That's so true. For all of life, really. But especially the parts involving landmines.
FO300017110	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
FO300017111	And looking at this landmine, it gives me an idea. It's a terrible device that does terrible things, of course. But it's easy to make your own, too.
FO300017112	Watch the details and look for broken patterns. That's where the traps are.
FO300017113	It appears that Mole Rats have a most fatal allergy to it. Explosively so.
FO300017114	That's very scientific of you! Personally, I wasn't sure if they were crabs or if they came from some sort of brine shrimp, perhaps.
FO300017115	Some of these observations about their armor and camouflage gave me an idea for reinforced, neutral-colored headgear.
FO300017116	Here, consider it thanks for not interfering with them. Oh, speaking of which, take these. So you can continue to avoid them in the future.
FO300017117	They descended from local crabs. I'd call them "Scylla Serrata Horrendus."
FO300017118	That's a very enlightened attitude you've got! Shame it doesn't stop bullets, huh?
FO300017119	Luckily, I'm here to patch you up. Now, hold still and quit fidgeting.
FO300017120	Pain's an abstract. I stay focused on the definable things, like survival.
FO300017121	Hrm. With the protected location and resources that came from those scientific advances, I can definitely see how it grew so quickly!
FO300017122	A bit of smarts leads to a big reward, huh? Speaking of which, in thanks, have a few of these, for the next time you've got to be quick on your wits.
FO300017123	Oh, and I'll let the Rivet City traders know they'll be favorably mentioned in the book. You'll get a discount buying gear from them in the future.
FO300017124	It began as a research station, which is why it's still a scientific haven.
FO300017125	Seems like a good thing to watch for when dealing with tech of any age. And it helps to pack a few pulse grenades, just in case. Here, have a few.
FO300017126	Even after reprogramming, the robots were of questionable value as allies.
FO300017127	I suspect you and I are two of the only people who really appreciate its value, yes!
FO300017128	Oh my goodness, when I'm done with this, I'll have to work on copying all of this information. It could take a while, you know.
FO300017129	Oh, but here's a book of mine and some caps for your research. Think of it as pay for a civilization worth of overdue books.
FO300017130	This is an entire library's archives. You know how valuable that is, right?
FO300017131	You do what you need to do to get food and medicine, I guess. It's not pretty, but I guess that's the way it's got to be, right?
FO300017132	Well, keep what you got. Just traded for a big food shipment, myself. Here, take a bit, my treat - the taste kind of grates after a while.
FO300017133	Those Raiders must've shot me twenty times. But who's counting?
FO300017134	Oh, sure you can, you tough ol' survivor. Now sit down before you fall down.
FO300017135	Now, after taking a few notes, I'll take care of that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made concoction.
FO300017136	I've never had a chance to test it out on someone so heavily dosed, but I'm sure it'll work just as well. Exciting, isn't it?
FO300017137	Well, it itches a little, but I can walk it off.
FO300017138	Oh. Well, if that's all! I'll just study this and hope there aren't any more explosions, shall I?
FO300017139	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
FO300017140	And looking at this landmine, it gives me an idea. It's a terrible device that does terrible things, of course. But it's easy to make your own, too.
FO300017141	There may have been an explosion or two. Oh, and a sniper. No big deal.
FO300017142	What? You're kidding, right? Wait, you aren't kidding. Probably a metabolic reaction to the chemicals.
FO300017143	It gives them quite a kick, like too much Jet or something.
FO300017144	Oh, really? Maybe their leader figures are bred, sort of like ant queens? I wonder if relocating a Mirelurk "king" would prompt the others to move.
FO300017145	Some of these observations about their armor and camouflage gave me an idea for reinforced, neutral-colored headgear.
FO300017146	Consider it thanks for not interfering with them. Oh, speaking of which, take these. So you can continue to avoid them in the future.
FO300017147	They don't seem to fight each other. So no struggle for leadership.
FO300017148	Luckily, I'm here to patch you up. Now, hold still and quit fidgeting.
FO300017149	I hardly even feel pain anymore, honestly.
FO300017150	I'll bet they used some sort of chemical device to drive off the Mirelurks. Or a sonic device? Anyway, I guess it worked pretty well!
FO300017151	A bit of smarts leads to a big reward, huh? Speaking of which, in thanks, have a few of these, for the next time you've got to be quick on your wits.
FO300017152	Oh, and I'll let the Rivet City traders know they'll be favorably mentioned in the book. You'll get a discount buying gear from them in the future.
FO300017153	They cleared out the Mirelurks. Then science folks and the rest moved in.
FO300017154	Well, I wouldn't have guessed you had it in you, but I suppose it worked out anyway.
FO300017155	Of course, I'll bet it helps to pack a few pulse grenades, just in case. Here, have a few.
FO300017156	I just hacked the mainframe so the robots would be a challenge.
FO300017157	You'd have laughed if you knew the words "card catalogue." I wonder if there'll be one down there once I tell the world about it?
FO300017158	Oh, and here's a book of mine and some caps for your research. Think of it as pay for a civilization worth of overdue books.
FO300017159	Now you can protect and catalogue all of the information it once had.
FO300017160	Bonus Snide Response
FO300017161	Well, keep what you got. Just traded for a big food shipment, myself. Here, take a bit, my treat - the taste kind of grates after a while.
FO300017162	I had a fun party with some Raiders. Then a guard robot jumped out of a cake.
FO300017163	Well, maybe if you're lucky, you'll end up looking like me, too!
FO300017164	Now, after taking a few notes, I'll take care of that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made concoction.
FO300017165	I've never had a chance to test it out on someone so heavily dosed, but I'm sure it'll work out fine. Exciting, isn't it?
FO300017166	I feel about as bad as you look.
FO300017167	You're a lucky one, you know. At this level, most people don't make it. But then again, most people don't have my experimental tricks!
FO300017168	Now, after taking a few notes, I'll take care of that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made concoction.
FO300017169	I've never had a chance to test it out on someone so heavily dosed, but I'm sure it'll work out fine. Exciting, isn't it?
FO300017170	Do you think I'm an idiot? I may be a little impulsive, but not an idiot. I'll just take a look at this on my own, then.
FO300017171	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
FO300017172	And looking at this landmine, it gives me an idea. It's a terrible device that does terrible things, of course. But it's easy to make your own, too.
FO300017173	Oh, disarming it's real easy. Just jump up and down on it. You go first.
FO300017174	That's horrible! You're horrible! This thing is horrible! Everything's horrible! Argh!
FO300017175	With that much testing, I guess it's beyond correction. Go ahead and keep it. Maybe you can find a nicer use for it. But I doubt it.
FO300017176	It's like explosive whack-a-Mole Rat. Can I get it in bullet form? For people?
FO300017177	Really? Are you kidding me? No, really. Are you? Huh. Guess I'll have to wait to see what I get from the observer.
FO300017178	Some of these observations about their armor and camouflage gave me an idea for reinforced, neutral-colored headgear.
FO300017179	Here, consider it thanks for not interfering with them. Oh, speaking of which, take these. So you can continue to avoid them in the future.
FO300017180	They've got a little, bubbling castle and they spend all day circling it. <Lie>
FO300017181	Luckily, I'm here to patch you up. Now, hold still and quit fidgeting.
FO300017182	My only solace is thinking about inflicting this pain on people like you.
FO300017183	Well, this data looks legitimate. An outgrowth of a science station, huh? Just goes to show what I always say about cleverness!
FO300017184	A bit of smarts leads to a big reward, huh? Speaking of which, in thanks, have a few of these, for the next time you've got to be quick on your wits.
FO300017185	Oh, and I'll let the Rivet City traders know they'll be favorably mentioned in the book. You'll get a discount buying gear from them in the future.
FO300017186	Some old coot says he took these notes. They seem reasonable enough.
FO300017187	Well, I guess one thing about using the old tech is that it can feel a bit like playing God. But you're probably not supposed to. I think.
FO300017188	Seems like a good thing to watch for when dealing with tech of any age. And it helps to pack a few pulse grenades, just in case. Here, have a few.
FO300017189	It was robotic carnage. But I caused it, so it was the okay sort of carnage.
FO300017190	What, like it was never touched? Well, that's the way it should be! Nothing can overcome the power of knowledge, after all!
FO300017191	Thank goodness it's safe! I'll make sure to tell people that they can find more information there. It'll become a holy place for the educated!
FO300017192	Here's a book of mine and some caps for your research. Think of it as pay for a civilization worth of overdue books.
FO300017193	The librarian's on duty. I'd have brought you a present, but I forgot my card.
FO300017194	MS03TaskBegin
FO300017195	Well, I think the first chapter will have to be about surviving day-to-day dangers.
FO300017196	Things like where it is and isn't safe to find food, the dangers of radiation, and how to avoid and even profit from dangerous landmines.
FO300017197	Ooh, sounds like fun, doesn't it? Which do you want to do first?
FO300017198	I'm ready to begin researching the book, now.
FO300017199	The last chapter's a bit more esoteric. It's about the survival of humanity as a whole, and how to rebuild society. Deep stuff, huh?
FO300017200	We need to know how large settlements are formed, how to harness the old technology, and I'll need you to get ancient history from a nearby library.
FO300017201	We're in the last stretch, now, so let's finish it up strong! What first?
FO300017202	I'm ready to start researching the last chapter.
FO300017203	The second chapter's going to be a bit trickier, I think. It'll cover how to handle creatures out there, for better or for worse.
FO300017204	For example, repelling Mole Rats, learning about Mirelurks, and when all else fails, how to handle being injured.
FO300017205	So, let's buckle down and get to work on this chapter. What first?
FO300017206	I'm ready to start researching the next chapter.
FO300017207	I still need to study a living specimen with radiation poisoning.
FO300017208	I need someone to research how to travel through a minefield.
FO300017209	And that'll cover the first section of the book. Which strikes your fancy?
FO300017210	I'm ready to continue research on the first chapter.
FO300017211	I've got to see how safe it is to scavenge food from one of those huge stores out there.
FO300017212	I need someone to research how to travel through a minefield.
FO300017213	And that'll cover the first section of the book. Which strikes your fancy?
FO300017214	I'm ready to continue research on the first chapter.
FO300017215	I've got to see how safe it is to scavenge food from one of those huge stores out there.
FO300017216	I still need to study a living specimen with radiation poisoning.
FO300017217	And that'll cover the first section of the book. Which strikes your fancy?
FO300017218	I'm ready to continue research on the first chapter.
FO300017219	But I need to see how radiation effects normal, not-so-gooey humans. I never seem to get a live example to study. Not for long, anyway.
FO300017220	The last part of this chapter is about radiation, right?
FO300017221	Yes, that's what I need your help on. I know lots about it from books, but I never seem to get a live example. Not for long, anyway.
FO300017222	The last part of this chapter is about radiation, right?
FO300017223	Well, food and medicine. Everyone needs them once in a while, right? So they need a good place to find them!
FO300017224	There's an old Super-Duper Mart not far from here. I need to know if a place like that still has any food or medicine left in it.
FO300017225	The last task for this chapter is getting food, right?
FO300017226	Landmines are one of the few dangers out there that you can profit from. Disarm one before it blows, and you can sell it for plenty of caps.
FO300017227	I've heard stories about a ghost town that's just full of mines. Traders just call the place "Minefield."
FO300017228	Sounds like the place for some fieldwork! Get in there, get back, and tell me all about it. And could you bring back a mine for my studies?
FO300017229	Let's finish up the chapter with that landmine research.
FO300017230	Landmines are one of the few dangers out there that you can profit from. Disarm one before it blows, and you can sell it for plenty of caps.
FO300017231	I've heard stories about a ghost town that's just full of mines. Traders just call the place "Minefield."
FO300017232	Sounds like the place for some fieldwork! Get in there, get back, and tell me all about it. And could you bring back a mine for my studies?
FO300017233	Let's finish up the chapter with that landmine research.
FO300017234	There's a sort of Mole Rat repellant I've developed. I need it to be tested on a few Mole Rats before I can say it's a success.
FO300017235	There's a lot we don't know about Mirelurks and how intelligent and dangerous they are. That definitely deserves research.
FO300017236	And that should be it for the second chapter. Which do you want to check out?
FO300017237	I'm ready for more research on the second chapter.
FO300017238	There's a sort of Mole Rat repellant I've developed. I need it to be tested on a few Mole Rats before I can say it's a success.
FO300017239	I hesitate to ask, but I'll need to examine the effects of serious physical trauma. I wouldn't ask if I couldn't fix you up afterwards, of course!
FO300017240	And that should be it for the second chapter. Which do you want to check out?
FO300017241	I'm ready for more research on the second chapter.
FO300017242	There's a lot we don't know about Mirelurks and how intelligent and dangerous they are. That definitely deserves research.
FO300017243	I hesitate to ask, but I'll need to examine the effects of serious physical trauma. I wouldn't ask if I couldn't fix you up afterwards, of course!
FO300017244	And that should be it for the second chapter. Which do you want to check out?
FO300017245	I'm ready for more research on the second chapter.
FO300017246	Mole Rats can burrow into almost anything and cause a lot of trouble. So I figured I'd make a chemical repellent stick for people to shoo them off.
FO300017247	But I need it to be tested before I put the recipe to paper in the guide. So I need you to find some Mole Rats and test it out a bit.
FO300017248	The last task for this chapter is something about Mole Rats, right?
FO300017249	Great! I never get to study anyone who's severely injured. Not without them crying to be fixed right away or trying to bleed out and all that.
FO300017250	But obviously, you can handle a lot of abuse, so if I'm ever going to find a good example of human anatomy and injury resistance, it'd be you.
FO300017251	Next time you get badly injured, return here so I can examine you before I heal you up. I mean, you're going to get yourself hurt anyway, right?
FO300017252	Okay, let's do that injury research to finish up this chapter.
FO300017253	Yes, knowing more about them can help people learn to avoid, or even outsmart them.
FO300017254	So I picked up this observer device to study them in their natural habitat. I need you to hide one in one of the spawning pods in their lairs.
FO300017255	The last part of this chapter is about Mirelurks, right?
FO300017256	I want to find out the history of how a successful settlement like Rivet City got started.
FO300017257	I've also got to do a section on working with old computer electronics, so there's some research to be done in the old RobCo Production facility.
FO300017258	And that'll be it for the last chapter. So, what'll it be?
FO300017259	I'm ready to continue research on the last chapter.
FO300017260	I want to find out the history of how a successful settlement like Rivet City got started.
FO300017261	Also, there used to be a big library out there. Imagine, a whole building full of books! I'll need you to gather information there for me.
FO300017262	And that'll be it for the last chapter. So, what'll it be?
FO300017263	I'm ready to continue research on the last chapter.
FO300017264	I've got to do a section on working with old computer electronics, so there's some research to be done in the old RobCo Production facility.
FO300017265	Also, there used to be a big library out there. Imagine, a whole building full of books! I'll need you to gather information there for me.
FO300017266	And that'll be it for the last chapter. So, what'll it be?
FO300017267	I'm ready to continue research on the last chapter.
FO300017268	Yes, Rivet City's in particular. It's the most successful survivor settlement around, but no one here really knows how it started.
FO300017269	Of course, that's why it's important to know how a place like that succeeded. So I need you to go there and do some researching!
FO300017270	The last part of this chapter is about researching local history, right?
FO300017271	Now then, a trader gave me this bit of electronics from the RobCo factory. It ought to go into some mainframe in there to control the robots.
FO300017272	If there's a way to reactivate and control the robots there, it'd make for a good example of harnessing the past's technology for the book!
FO300017273	It does, doesn't it? I mostly just deal with it after it's junked. But a trader gave me this bit of electronics from the RobCo factory.
FO300017274	If there's a way to reactivate and control the robots there, it'd make for a good example of harnessing the past's technology for the book!
FO300017275	The last subject is old technology, right? Sounds interesting.
FO300017276	Yes. Books are where the old world kept its knowledge, and libraries are where it kept the books. And there's supposed to be one in Arlington.
FO300017277	See if it's still there, and if you can download records from its computer. Information dumps like those would be invaluable for rebuilding humanity!
FO300017278	The last part of this chapter is about the library, right?
FO300017279	MS03TaskDescription2
FO300017280	But I need to see how radiation effects normal, not-so-gooey humans. I never seem to get a live example to study. Not for long, anyway.
FO300017281	What's this about radiation?
FO300017282	Well, that's what I need your help for, isn't it? I know lots about it from books, but I never seem to get a live example. Not for long, anyway.
FO300017283	What's this about radiation?
FO300017284	Mirelurks are a big threat in some areas, and knowing more about them can help people learn to avoid, or even outsmart them.
FO300017285	So I picked up this observer device to study them in their natural habitat. I need you to hide it in one of the spawning pods in their lairs.
FO300017286	What's this about studying Mirelurks?
FO300017287	Oh, this is so exciting! I feel like I'm sending you out on some sort of super-assignment!
FO300017288	Supposedly, if you connect it to the mainframe at the RobCo factory, you get access to an army of robots!
FO300017289	Seems like it's right up your alley, huh? And it'd be a great example of how to harness technology, wouldn't it?
FO300017290	It does, doesn't it? I mostly just deal with it after it's junked. But a trader gave me this RobCo processor widget. He said it's worth a fortune!
FO300017291	According to him, if it's connected to the mainframe in the RobCo factory, you could have access to all the robots you'd ever want!
FO300017292	Now that would be a great example of how to harness technology, wouldn't it?
FO300017293	Using old technology sounds interesting.
FO300017294	Landmines are one of the few dangers out there that you can profit from. Disarm one before it blows, and you can sell it for plenty of caps.
FO300017295	I've heard stories about a ghost town that's just full of mines. Traders just call the place "Minefield."

FO300017305	I mean, you're going to get yourself hurt anyway, right?
FO300017306	I'm going to hate myself for this, but what do you mean about handling injury?
FO300017307	Oh, that'd sure save me a lot of time. But I bet then it wouldn't have your name on it, now would it?
FO300017308	Books are where the old world kept its knowledge, and libraries are where it kept the books. And there's supposed to be one in Arlington.
FO300017309	See if it's still there, and if you can download records from its computer. Information dumps like those would be invaluable for rebuilding humanity!
FO300017310	I could check the library. Maybe someone's already written a book like yours.
FO300017311	Oh, that'd sure save me a lot of time. But I bet their book wouldn't have anything about exploding Mole Rats, would it?
FO300017312	Books are where the old world kept its knowledge, and libraries are where it kept the books. And there's supposed to be one in Arlington.

FO300017315	Actually, I'll have to wait a bit.
FO300017316	Well, I guess I can wait a little. I've got plenty of other projects to work on, after all.

FO300017350	Your pals over at the Lincoln Memorial seemed pretty happy with me.
FO300017351	Tell me more about these preferred targets you want me to enslave.
FO300017352	There's four that Eulogy wants especially. Arkansas, Susan Lancaster, Red, and Flak. Which of those assholes do you want to know about?
FO300017353	Which one do you want to know about?
FO300017354	Tell me more about this Mesmetron.
FO300017355	Great. I'd LOVE to talk to you some more. What the hell do you want to know now?
FO300017356	You want just these VIPs, or do you want other slaves too?
FO300017357	Bring me one of those VIPs and I'll let you up into Paradise Falls.
FO300017358	But, since Eulogy's got me on watchdog duty all the time, I don't get to make much commission.
FO300017359	If you round up any slaves, I'll gladly split the commission with you.
FO300017360	But don't get any wise ideas. I'm the guy who monitors the slave collar radio signals, and notes any new "arrivals."
FO300017361	If you round up any slaves, I'll gladly split the commission with you.
FO300017362	I can enslave criminals and the like, right? I don't have to enslave innocents?
FO300017363	I promise, nobody I'm sending you after is "innocent". Whatever that means.
FO300017364	You don't honestly believe anyone out there in the Wasteland is innocent, do you?
FO300017365	Eulogy's got a special contract out for a few VIPs. I'm too busy or I'd get them myself. You get them for me, and I let you in. Deal?
FO300017366	Okay, hotshot. We'll see how you do. Eulogy's got a few special contracts he wants filled. I'm too busy or I'd grab them myself.
FO300017367	If you don't screw it up, I might even split the commission with you.
FO300017368	Oh, I see. You're some kind of hot shot? Fine. Here's the deal.
FO300017369	Eulogy's got a few special contracts he wants filled. I'm too busy or I'd grab them myself. So you're going to do it for me.
FO300017370	Do this for me, and I'll get you into Paradise. And if you don't screw it up, I might even split the commission with you.
FO300017371	You want a fucking resume? Just tell me what to do, asshole.
FO300017372	Maybe you would fit in around here.
FO300017373	Eulogy's got a special contract out on a few VIPs. You bring them in, I'll split the commission with you.
FO300017374	You might fit in after all.
FO300017375	Eulogy's got a special contract out on a few VIPs. I'm too damn busy or I'd go get them myself.
FO300017376	I'll split the commission with you. And don't you get all bitchy. Do this for me, and I'll get you into Paradise.

FO300017379	I need another collar so I can get more slaves.
FO300017380	Those collars ain't easy to come by. So, you got to pay for the ones you waste.

FO300017402	Amata! Where did you get that gun?
FO300017403	Be reasonable, Amata. Officer Mack may enjoy this, but I don't. Just tell us where to find your friend, so we can talk to him.
FO300017404	Be reasonable, Amata. Officer Mack may enjoy this, but I don't. Just tell us where to find your friend, so we can talk to her.
FO300017405	Now then, are you ready to tell me where your friend has gone? There's no need for any more of this.
FO300017406	Amata, please. Don't be stubborn. I only want to talk to your friend. Surely you understand what's at stake here.
FO300017407	Just get away from me! I don't want to shoot you but I will. I swear I will!
FO300017408	I'm not telling you anything! And don't pretend you aren't enjoying this, Daddy. You're sick!
FO300017409	What are you going to do, Daddy? Beat me to death, like you did poor Jonas?
FO300017410	If you think I'll betray him, you don't know me very well.
FO300017411	If you think I'll betray her, you don't know me very well.
FO300017412	Daddy, please stop! Don't you understand, I can't tell you. Why are you doing this to me?
FO300017413	Please stop. Please don't have him hit me again. Don't you care that I'm your own daughter?
FO300017414	How dare you threaten me! And with my own gun! I'm your father, damn you, and you'll show me some respect!
FO300017415	Very well. There's no hurry. Your friend isn't going anywhere, after all.
FO300017416	Amata, darling. Why must you be so stubborn? The last thing I want is to see you hurt, but my duty to the Vault comes first.
FO300017417	I've always indulged you, Amata. And now you've taken advantage of my lenience.
FO300017418	Officer Mack! Don't just stand there!
FO300017419	Again.
FO300017420	One more time.
FO300017421	Go ahead, Officer.
FO300017422	Don't make me take that gun away from you, girlie. Just hand it over nice and easy now.
FO300017423	You'd better talk, girlie.
FO300017424	Do what your dad says, Amata.
FO300017425	You need to learn some respect.
FO300017426	No! Get away from me!
FO300017427	Stop it!
FO300017428	No, please don't!
FO300017429	Please, Daddy, no!
FO300017430	That's enough, officer.
FO300017431	That'll do for now.
FO300017432	All right, officer. Let me try again.
FO300017433	I told you, I don't know anything!
FO300017434	Be reasonable, Amata. Officer Mack may enjoy this, but I don't. Just tell us where to find your friend, so we can talk to him.
FO300017435	Be reasonable, Amata. Officer Mack may enjoy this, but I don't. Just tell us where to find your friend, so we can talk to her.
FO300017436	He's my friend. I was worried about him. What does he have to do with any of this anyway?
FO300017437	She's my friend. I was worried about her. What does she have to do with any of this anyway?
FO300017438	Probably nothing. Which is why you need to tell me where he is, so I can talk to him.
FO300017439	Probably nothing. Which is why you need to tell me where she is, so I can talk to her.
FO300017440	Go to hell.
FO300017441	Whoa! Really? Raiders and robots! I guess I wasn't the only one to think about checking those stores. Looks like you gotta be careful looting them.
FO300017442	I found Raiders and a robot. It was hardly a safe place to scavenge.
FO300017443	You're a mighty lucky one, you know that? At this state, most people'd have trouble standing up, much less walking over here.
FO300017444	Now, let me take a few notes, and I'll handle that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made rad-cure concoction.
FO300017445	I've never had a chance to test it out on someone so heavily dosed, but I'm sure it'll work out fine. Exciting, isn't it?
FO300017446	Just do your examination and fix me up, please.
FO300017447	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
FO300017448	And looking at this landmine, it gives me an idea. It's a terrible device that does terrible things, of course. But it's easy to make your own, too.
FO300017449	That whole place is a deathtrap.
FO300017450	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
FO300017451	And looking at this landmine, it gives me an idea. It's a terrible device that does terrible things, of course. But it's easy to make your own, too.
FO300017452	That whole town is a trap. There was a sniper out there, just waiting for me.
FO300017453	With that much testing, I guess it's beyond correction. Go ahead and keep it. Maybe you can find a nicer use for it, right?
FO300017454	Sorry, Moira, but your "Repellent" is fatal to Mole Rats.
FO300017455	Oh... That's unpleasant, but I guess it's no surprise. Practically everything out there can eat us. This bottom of the food chain thing really sucks.
FO300017456	Some of these observations about their armor and camouflage gave me an idea for reinforced, neutral-colored headgear.
FO300017457	Here, consider it thanks for not interfering with them. Oh, speaking of which, take these. So you can continue to avoid them in the future.
FO300017458	They're definitely vicious and highly territorial.
FO300017459	Ah yes, that makes a lot of sense. And it does help when you're sewing up wounds and setting bones, too. That seems like it'd be tough to do alone.
FO300017460	Luckily, I'm here to patch you up. Now, hold still and quit fidgeting.
FO300017461	The adrenaline helps. So does the fear of death. There's a lot of both.
FO300017462	Huh. I would have figured the science station came afterwards. Well, good to see genius get rewarded!
FO300017463	A bit of smarts leads to a big reward, huh? Speaking of which, in thanks, have a few of these, for the next time you've got to be quick on your wits.
FO300017464	Oh, and I'll let the Rivet City traders know they'll be favorably mentioned in the book. You'll get a discount buying gear from them in the future.
FO300017465	It began as a successful science station, and traders settled in around it.
FO300017466	So, they were dangerous until you got control of them? Definitely a good lesson in there about using old technology.
FO300017467	Seems like a good thing to watch for when dealing with tech of any age. And it helps to pack a few pulse grenades, just in case. Here, have a few.
FO300017468	Once I adjusted their programming, the robots were no problem.
FO300017469	Well, of course! That's why I sent you there, after all!
FO300017470	And good work retrieving it, too! I'll see how much I can work into the guide itself.
FO300017471	Oh, and here's a book of mine and some caps for your research. Think of it as pay for a civilization worth of overdue books.
FO300017472	The archive was probably the most useful information in there.
FO300017473	Basic Normal Response
FO300017474	It makes sense that there'd be a few Raiders there. But if that's the only concern, that hardly makes it worse than anywhere else out there.
FO300017475	It's got a lot more food than most places, but I wasn't the only one there.
FO300017476	Well, here's hoping you don't have to get anything worse for a while, huh?
FO300017477	Now, let me take a few notes, and I'll handle that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made rad-cure concoction.
FO300017478	Itchiness, sores, and so forth. Not the worst I've had, but still not fun.
FO300017479	I guess placement of each step would be critical, wouldn't it? Especially if each one could be your last.
FO300017480	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
FO300017481	No, but it was a close call. Moving slow and staying off the dirt helped.
FO300017482	That's not how it was supposed to work at all! The poor little Mole Ratties with their little noses! That's just horrible!
FO300017483	I guess it's back to the drawing board for that repellent. I wonder if I can make it into some sort of fuel. Anyway, I'll just take that.
FO300017484	I don't think it works like you hoped. The Mole Rats all died.
FO300017485	I wish we could have gotten more information, but this'll have to do for the book. Here's your pay. Maybe they'll help you be sneakier next time.
FO300017486	They're pretty much crab-based humanoids.
FO300017487	Well, rest easy and I'll see about fixing you up once I take a few notes.
FO300017488	It feels like a dozen Super Mutants did a dance on my spine in steel boots.
FO300017489	Really? That's pretty unbelievable!
FO300017490	I mean, really, I'm not sure I can believe that. But I guess if that's what they said, what else is there to go on?
FO300017491	Oh well. Still, for your help, have a few of these. They may help out next time you need to talk to a few folks.
FO300017492	According to them, it was all set up by one upper deck resident.
FO300017493	It helps to have the right tool for the job. Failing that, go with the right tool to cheat at the job. Like a pulse grenade. Here, have a couple.
FO300017494	It was easy enough to attach the unit. The mainframe took care of the rest.
FO300017495	Oh, it's about time! I guess everyone else is watching out for their precious guns, food, and loved ones first. No time for books.
FO300017496	Still, it's good to know it's standing. Maybe I'll inspire someone to take care of the place. Have some caps as payment for that little bit of hope.
FO300017497	Yeah, it's still there. The Brotherhood's even trying to clear out the place.
FO300017498	MS03TaskSetDone
FO300017499	Yup, you've done a great job! I just need to add in the section on how to cook rat, and this chapter's done.
FO300017500	Here, for your services, I've saved up quite a few Stimpaks. Of course, you may need them: we've still got two more chapters to go.
FO300017501	That completes the first chapter's tasks, correct?
FO300017502	Absolutely! I'm glad to finish it up, but I'll bet you're even happier, right?
FO300017503	Just one last chapter, now. And it's much safer, I promise!
FO300017504	Is that all of the research for the second chapter?
FO300017505	It certainly is. With that last bit of info, I'm all done!
FO300017506	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
FO300017507	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
FO300017508	Is that it for the last chapter?
FO300017509	Correct, and it's looking very smart. Very smart, indeed! They'll be dazzled by our intelligence!
FO300017510	Here, for your services, I've saved up quite a few stimpaks. Of course, you may need them: we've still got two more chapters to go.
FO300017511	That completes the first chapter's tasks, right?
FO300017512	Correct, as always! And your feedback's really led to a very smartly written book. Maybe too smart for some folks, I worry.
FO300017513	Of course, if the reader can't be bothered to understand something important as a book on how to stay alive, then what can we do, huh?
FO300017514	And in case those readers blame you for their ignorance, here's your payment: two big boxes of ammo. Now, on to the next chapter!
FO300017515	I suspect this completes the second chapter's research, correct?
FO300017516	Yes, that concludes our exceptional expert endeavor! I have to admit, I was worried it would go over some peoples' heads, but it should be fine.
FO300017517	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
FO300017518	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
FO300017519	And now my research for your book is completed. Isn't it?
FO300017520	Yup. It's looking like it'll be a real tough book for real tough guys. And real tough gals, too, of course!
FO300017521	Here, for your services, I've saved up quite a few stimpaks. Of course, you may need them: we've still got two more chapters to go.
FO300017522	Is that all for the first chapter?
FO300017523	You bet. Your feedback is just the stuff for that rough-and-tumble, survive-anything sort of feel!
FO300017524	Of course, readers who aren't already rough-and-tumble may have a hard time dealing with it. But I'm sure they'll pick up survival as they go.
FO300017525	Is the second chapter done yet?
FO300017526	Yup, that's the last bit for the toughest survival guide in the Wastes! Survivors of the world, rejoice! And everyone else, too!
FO300017527	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
FO300017528	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
FO300017529	Are we done with the last chapter?
FO300017530	It most certainly does. And if I keep writing in the style of some of your reports, this is going to be one mighty slick book!
FO300017531	Here, for your services, I've saved up quite a few stimpaks. Of course, you may need them: we've still got two more chapters to go.
FO300017532	Does that finish out the first chapter?
FO300017533	Oh, it's very real, and very complete. I think I'm really capturing that sly and stylish way you have of getting around problems out there!
FO300017534	Of course, I worry I'll write with too much style and not enough substance. So keep bringing me back good research, and that won't be a problem!
FO300017535	Here's your payment: I know ammo isn't really your style, but think of it as excellent bartering material. Now, on to the next chapter!
FO300017536	Is it just my imagination, or does that complete the second chapter?
FO300017537	Smooth, suave, and done with a smile. I swear I picked up a few pointers from your style, myself!
FO300017538	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
FO300017539	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
FO300017540	Correct me if I'm wrong, but that completes the book. Right?
FO300017541	It definitely is. I'm trying to put that same great sense of humor you've got into the book. Keep it up, and it'll inform and entertain!
FO300017542	Here, for your services, I've saved up quite a few stimpaks. Of course, you may need them: we've still got two more chapters to go.
FO300017543	Is the first chapter done yet?
FO300017544	Oh, you. Of course we are. And I think I'm really capturing that snide wit of yours. So, for all your snippiness, I think it'll help the book.
FO300017545	Still, I can put up with plenty of your little jabs, as long as the research is good.
FO300017546	And, yes, you'll still get paid. Here: nothing says loving like big boxes of ammunition, right? Now, on to the next chapter?
FO300017547	This chapter done yet? I don't know how much more research I can take.
FO300017548	Well, lucky for you, we're done! And for all your nasty attitude, I think the quips made it a lot more entertaining to read. That's bound to help.
FO300017549	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
FO300017550	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
FO300017551	I swear, if I have to research anything else, I'll just shoot myself now.
FO300017552	Tell me more about the pay.
FO300017553	Oh, caps, chems, meds, and maybe even a few unique inventions, if you do a good job. I'm sure I've got something that'll catch your eye.
FO300017554	With a little ingenuity, you can turn a pile of junk into a mountain of caps! And there's no shortage of junk! So, will you help out?
FO300017555	We did it!
FO300017556	Take that, Muties!
FO300017557	I didn't think that'd work!
FO300017558	Die Mutants, DIE!!!!
FO300017559	You mean, we're still alive?
FO300017560	Hurray!
FO300017561	Yeah baby!
FO300017562	Yay!
FO300017563	Sneaky!
FO300017564	Hide and seek! I'm good at this game.
FO300017565	Oh, I get it now!
FO300017566	I feel stupid walking around like this.
FO300017567	Aha!
FO300017568	Yeah baby! I'm practically invisible!
FO300017569	Careful where you point those things!
FO300017570	Bang! Bang! Bang! Oh yeah! You're dead meat now!
FO300017571	Yeehaa!
FO300017572	For the record I'm not having fun!
FO300017573	Oh baby! Did you see that? Did you see it! I'm a sharpshooting gun slinger!
FO300017574	Die! Die! Die!
FO300017575	Hahahaha!
FO300017576	I like guns.
FO300017577	Everybody be careful!
FO300017578	I bet I could walk through here just fine.
FO300017579	This is going to end in tragedy.
FO300017580	Am I the only one who thinks this is stupid?
FO300017581	Oh baby! Explosions are fun. I can't wait! I bet my mine makes the biggest explosion of all.
FO300017582	Die mutie bastards!
FO300017583	Am I doing this right?
FO300017584	These things are cool.
FO300017585	That's pretty cool!
FO300017586	I'll still get to patrol the town too, right?
FO300017587	That bucket of bolts is supposed to protect us?
FO300017588	This is lame. I'm going to sit in my room and think about death.
FO300017589	Robots are super-duper! Man, I wish I was a robot. Wouldn't it be cool to be a robot?
FO300017590	These robots better kill those Super Mutants!
FO300017591	That seems complicated.
FO300017592	I like robots.
FO300017593	Our hero returns!
FO300017594	Our heroine returns!
FO300017595	Did he rescue them?!
FO300017596	Did she rescue them?!
FO300017597	Bleh! He's coming to tell us he failed!
FO300017598	Bleh! She's coming to tell us she failed!
FO300017599	What? Don't I count for something? He rescued me at least!
FO300017600	What? Don't I count for something? She rescued me at least!
FO300017601	I told you he could do it, but you didn't listen to me! You never listen to me!
FO300017602	I told you she could do it, but you didn't listen to me! You never listen to me!
FO300017603	Hurray!
FO300017604	Alright! Welcome back!
FO300017605	Yea!
FO300017606	I got you the slave you wanted. I can get into Paradise Falls now, right?
FO300017607	Yeah. Yeah. Go on up, hotshot. Just don't screw around, or things will get ugly. No second chances. Got it?
FO300017608	You can't come with me?
FO300017609	Sorry, I'm afraid a Super Mutant wouldn't be welcome in the places you frequent.
FO300017610	All I would do is cause you undue attention and probably get you killed.
FO300017611	What do I do once I trip the fire control console?
FO300017612	I'll stay here until you've cleared a path to me.
FO300017613	Just be careful. Some of these "failed experiments" are quite nasty.
FO300017614	Do you know what the G.E.C.K. does?
FO300017615	Some say it does nothing; that it's simply a pipe dream or a legend. Others feel the device is actually beneficial.
FO300017616	The latter group claims it creates life where none exists. A new beginning for man.
FO300017617	Some of the Vaults came equipped with them so after people emerged into the Wasteland, they could restart the world.
FO300017618	I'm not sure which to believe.
FO300017619	We can discuss this later. Right now, concentrate on getting this door open.
FO300017620	If you've been here as long as I imagine maybe you can help me.
FO300017621	Perhaps. I assume you're here to find the G.E.C.K.
FO300017622	Okay, Fawkes. You've got a deal.
FO300017623	I'm glad to see you are a sensible person.
FO300017624	Now, get me out of this place. I can't stand it anymore!
FO300017625	How do I know you won't run the second I get you out?
FO300017626	There's no way to prove it, you'll just have to take my word for it.
FO300017627	I've already helped you by warning you about the radiation. Take that as a gesture of good faith.
FO300017628	So what do you say?
FO300017629	How do I get you out?
FO300017630	At the end of the hallway to your right is a maintenance room.
FO300017631	Inside, you'll find the fire control console for the medical area. Trip the alarm on it, and I'll be able to get out.
FO300017632	A word of warning though. Tripping the console activates a failsafe and will open ALL of the recovery rooms in the medical area.
FO300017633	So, what do you think? Can you do it?
FO300017634	I'm not worried. I can mow down whatever's in my way.
FO300017635	Unless your weapons can destroy radiation, I'd say that will prove difficult.
FO300017636	The G.E.C.K. is in a chamber flooded with deadly radiation. I doubt you could survive inside very long. However, I can.
FO300017637	Let me out of here, and I will place the G.E.C.K. safely in your hands.
FO300017638	Why would I have difficulty getting the G.E.C.K.?
FO300017639	The chamber in which the G.E.C.K. resides is absolutely flooded with radiation. It's unlikely you'd survive very long.
FO300017640	Myself, on the other hand, have surprisingly inherited a useful trait from my fellow Meta Humans. I am highly resistant to radiation.
FO300017641	Let me out of here, and I will place the G.E.C.K. safely in your hands.
FO300017642	How about you tell me all you know and I don't paint the wall with your brains?
FO300017643	What is it with your kind? This is why the bombs fell you know.
FO300017644	I have no reason to tell you anything. You kill me, you get nothing. So what's the point?
FO300017645	Let me out of this place and I'll retrieve the G.E.C.K. for you.
FO300017646	Good, tell me everything you know about it, then!
FO300017647	Not so fast. Quid pro quo, my friend. If I'm to do this service for you, I expect to get something in return.
FO300017648	Release me from this makeshift prison and I will personally take you to the G.E.C.K. and retrieve it for you.
FO300017649	Why would you help me?
FO300017650	Because, you can help me.
FO300017651	Let me out of this place. I can't take it anymore. I can't even recall how long I've been here.
FO300017652	Take me with you, and I'll retrieve the G.E.C.K. for you.
FO300017653	Sorry, I have to get going. I don't have time for this.
FO300017654	So be it. Take your device and leave me here. It's what I expected.
FO300017655	When you give up because you can't get the G.E.C.K. and you realize your mistake, you'll be back.
FO300017656	The G.E.C.K.? Never heard of it. <Lie.>
FO300017657	I read a tape once on how to tell if someone's lying and I must say you're a terrible liar.
FO300017658	Why else would you be in this horrible place if it wasn't to get it? People before you have tried and failed many times.
FO300017659	However, you're in luck. I know where it is and best of all, I know how you can get your hands on it.
FO300017660	What do you know about the G.E.C.K.?
FO300017661	I know what it is, I know where it is and best of all, I know how you can get your hands on it.
FO300017662	I wish I could stay and chat, but I need to find something important.
FO300017663	How come they've kept you alive?
FO300017664	I think when I was created, something went wrong and I didn't come out like they planned.
FO300017665	Just like the other things in this makeshift cell block, we're the results of what they would call failed experiments if they were smart enough.
FO300017666	Why have you been imprisoned?
FO300017667	Because I'm a curiosity; an anomaly. They don't know why I'm different than they are and I think it fascinates them.
FO300017668	All of the locked rooms in the medical wing contain failed experiments that they created.
FO300017669	Sorry, I have more important things to do.
FO300017670	Very well. If this is what's to be expected from interacting with humans, then I'm likely better off in here than out there amongst you.
FO300017671	That's quite an unusual name.
FO300017672	It was taken from a historical entry in the computer. The name comes from a man who was willing to fight and die for what he believed in.
FO300017673	I felt it was appropriate given my circumstances.
FO300017674	It's amazing how well you can speak.
FO300017675	Yes. I suppose it is. When my captors placed me here, they were too stupid to realize this room contained a working terminal.
FO300017676	I've spent all my life teaching myself to read and speak based on the information stored on the Vault's Mainframe.
FO300017677	Ironic, isn't it? Surrounded by the world's history and yet my world consists of this tiny room.
FO300017678	You're kind of weirding me out. I've got to go.
FO300017679	No, please. I haven't had a civil conversation all my life! Don't go!
FO300017680	I could help you!
FO300017681	A friendly Super Mutant. Well, now I've seen everything.
FO300017682	Ugh. Must you use that vulgar term?
FO300017683	Yes, I was born in the F.E.V. Chambers but a Super Mutant I certainly am not. I prefer the term Meta Human. Suits me better don't you think?
FO300017684	Perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. The name's Fawkes.
FO300017685	Give me one good reason not to kill you.
FO300017686	What's the matter with you? I assure you I'm unlike the others in this dank place.
FO300017687	The name's Fawkes. I'd shake your hand, but this room happens to be my prison cell.
FO300017688	Yes, I'm human. But what are you?
FO300017689	Me? You care who I am?
FO300017690	Forgive me, but I'm not used to pleasantries. I'm more used to grunts and being struck about by the others.
FO300017691	We will now recite the blessing to ward off any harm the Outsider may be carrying before he proceeds to the Grove.
FO300017692	I bid you depart, agents of destruction, through the power of His divine will.
FO300017693	Leave our homes and bodies immediately; live no longer in them, but pass over into places where you can harm no one.
FO300017694	All this may He be so good as to grant us, who is to come to judge the living and the dead, and the world by his verdure.
FO300017695	Amen.
FO300017696	Soon you will pass peacefully into sleep, Outsider. And when you awake, you will witness His glory first hand.
FO300017697	Hannibal Hamlin is dead.
FO300017698	This must be my lucky day. That runaway slave of mine is dead, and I didn't even have to pay for it!
FO300017699	You've done me a great favor. Now we can go home.
FO300017700	I had hoped to do it myself, so I'm only paying half because you didn't follow orders.
FO300017701	At least those slaves have been stopped. Paradise Falls still owes you a debt of gratitude. Come by and see us sometime.
FO300017702	MS01Sentry
FO300017703	Muties! Muties! The Muties are coming!
FO300017704	Muties!
FO300017705	Muties! They're coming!!!
FO300017706	Mutants! Incoming!
FO300017707	Super Mutants!
FO300017708	Everyone get ready!
FO300017709	Hey small people!
FO300017710	We here, gonna collect some more of you!
FO300017711	Don't be scared!
FO300017712	Ahahahaha!
FO300017713	Don't be shy!
FO300017714	Who's it going to be this time?
FO300017715	The time has come!
FO300017716	Don't you want to be like us?
FO300017717	Graahahaha!
FO300017718	Where are they?
FO300017719	Don't know.
FO300017720	They're gone!
FO300017721	Scared 'em and they runned off! Now what?
FO300017722	GRRR! Fine. Somewhere else. Come on. Let's GO!
FO300017723	GRRAAAHHHH!
FO300017724	Actually, never mind.
FO300017725	Return if you have more questions.
FO300017726	I wanted to ask about the Holotags.
FO300017727	Yes? What about them?
FO300017728	I had a few questions about them.
FO300017729	It is my duty to provide knowledge that benefits the Brotherhood.
FO300017730	I've found some Holotags.
FO300017731	Have you? It saddens me to hear of my fallen brethren, but their names and deeds shall be records. Tell me, how many have you found?
FO300017732	Let's talk about something else.
FO300017733	As you wish. Just remember: more tags, more reward. I know how you outsiders think.
FO300017734	What's my reward if I bring you these Holotags?
FO300017735	We have access to a great deal of technology, and because of that, there are a number of things that we can continue to produce.
FO300017736	I will be able to offer you caps for the tags you bring me, but from time to time, I will be able to give you something a bit more interesting.
FO300017737	Why can't you send your own people to find the Holotags?
FO300017738	As I told you, with the increase in Super Mutant activity and Elder Lyons' edicts regarding our goals, we are critically short on manpower.
FO300017739	Any soldier that I would ask to do this task is one less soldier fighting in the field or defending the Citadel.
FO300017740	As much as I hate to involve outsiders, it is necessary if I am to properly maintain the scrolls to honor the dead.
FO300017741	Where can I find Holotags?
FO300017742	They are on our fallen Brothers throughout the DC Ruins. However, I can't give you a full report on the locations of all of our operations.
FO300017743	As I said, many of the units in the field operate independently, sometimes not reporting into the Citadel for weeks or months.
FO300017744	What are the Scrolls that you mentioned?
FO300017745	Scrolls are kept by the Head Librarian of each Brotherhood bunker. The Scrolls are a record of the Brotherhood itself.
FO300017746	Into each Scroll is written the name and deeds of each of our Brothers. Battles, what technology he has recovered, when he was promoted. Everything.
FO300017747	The last entry for each Brother is that Brother's death. It is important, as the way a man dies is just as important as the manner in which he lives.
FO300017748	And so each man who nobly serves the Brotherhood ascends into our history, to be remembered by those who come after him.
FO300017749	<Yawn.>
FO300017750	And worse than that problem, a Brother fallen in the field would have no one to carry word of his death back to me.
FO300017751	In calmer times, we could send detachments and messengers to learn their fates, but with our manpower stretched thin, we have no such luxury.
FO300017752	Which is why I must now ask you for your help. Each Brother wears a Holotag like the one you found.
FO300017753	Should you find any of the fallen Brethren in the field, I ask that you return their tags to me, so that I might record their deeds in the scrolls.
FO300017754	You can't keep track of your own damn soldiers? Who runs this place?
FO300017755	I would ask that you respect the Elder as you would your own father. And rude as you may be, you are correct. We can't keep track of them.
FO300017756	And worse than that problem, a Brother fallen in the field would have no one to carry word of his death back to me.
FO300017757	In calmer times, we could send detachments and messengers to learn their fates, but with our manpower stretched thin, we have no such luxury.
FO300017758	Which is why I must now ask you for your help. Each Brother wears a Holotag like the one you found.
FO300017759	Should you find any of the fallen Brethren in the field, I ask that you return their tags to me, so that I might record their deeds in the scrolls.
FO300017760	And without radio equipment, you can't keep track of them?
FO300017761	Exactly. A Brother fallen in the field may have no one to carry word of his death back to me.
FO300017762	In calmer times, we could send detachments and messengers to learn their fates, but with our manpower stretched thin, we have no such luxury.
FO300017763	Which is why I must now ask you for your help. Each Brother wears a Holotag like the one you found.
FO300017764	Should you find any of the fallen Brethren in the field, I ask that you return their tags to me, so that I might record their deeds in the scrolls.
FO300017765	Frankly, I don't give a damn.
FO300017766	That's what I would expect an outsider to say.
FO300017767	How about we skip the story and you just tell me what you want.
FO300017768	Very well. It's as simple as this. I need someone to collect Holotags from our fallen brethren in the field.
FO300017769	Bring them to me so that I can record the fallen Brothers in the Scrolls, and I will reward you. And that's all that you need to know.
FO300017770	Sure, I've got all the time in the world.
FO300017771	Good. As I'm sure you've noticed, the Brotherhood operates all over the DC ruins, often detached from the main base here at the Citadel.
FO300017772	We're short on communication equipment, so many of the groups in the field operate as independent cells without standing orders.
FO300017773	All right then.
FO300017774	Glad to be of help.
FO300017775	Where can I find Scribe Jameson?
FO300017776	She spends most of her time in the Archives. You'll find them in A Ring, near the great hall.
FO300017777	I'll escape without your help, then. I'm not the one who started killing people.
FO300017778	Save your sanctimony. The world is a dangerous place and I make no apologies for doing whatever it takes to keep the Vault safe.
FO300017779	Guards! Help me!
FO300017780	Amata trusts me. If you don't give me what I want, I'll hurt her. Bad.
FO300017781	My God, you're a coldblooded little shit, aren't you? I think you'd actually do it.
FO300017782	Here. Take them and leave the Vault. I'll have you shot on sight if you ever come back.
FO300017783	You're right. You will die if you don't give me that password.
FO300017784	I've dealt with your kind before, you little snotnose punk. You should have run like your coward of a father.
FO300017785	I'm here to kill you. Jonas was my friend.
FO300017786	A regrettable incident. But will killing me bring back your friend?
FO300017787	Think a moment. If you really care about your fellow citizens, killing me is the worst thing you could do.
FO300017788	Without an Overseer, the Vault would be plunged into chaos and disaster. Surely you can see that as well as I.
FO300017789	Come now, turn yourself in and we can resolve this whole thing peacefully. Just because your father betrayed us doesn't mean you have to.
FO300017790	If you ever lay a hand on Amata again, I'll make you regret it.
FO300017791	I place the good of the Vault above everything, even my own paternal feelings. We must not allow sentiment to cloud our judgment!
FO300017792	But I admire your protective instincts. Very well. I give you my word that Amata will not suffer further because of your actions.
FO300017793	Now then. If you really care about Amata, you will see how dangerous your father's actions were.
FO300017794	Hand over your weapons, and put an end to this dangerous situation. There's no need to join your father as a traitor to the Vault.
FO300017795	Just give me the keys to your office and your password. Then I'll be going.
FO300017796	Oh, is that all? Is there anything else I can get you while you're here?
FO300017797	You'll get nothing from me. I'll die before I see the safety of the Vault compromised again.
FO300017798	When we're done with this, everyone can have a nice cold glass of water on me. Let's move.
FO300017799	We need to move quickly, before we lose the chance to surprise them. Get whatever supplies you don't already have, and we'll meet in the Bailey.
FO300017800	We'll use the robot to keep them occupied while we get inside and secure the control room.
FO300017801	Once the fields are down, we head straight for the facility.
FO300017802	So we're on fire support. We stay close to the thing, keep it clear, and get it to where it needs to go.
FO300017803	Rothchild and Li say this robot should be able to take down the energy fields.
FO300017804	The Pride is on me. The goal is Project Purity, but we can't get into the facility with those energy fields up.
FO300017805	Okay, we're going to go over it one more time.
FO300017806	I think I need another minute or two.
FO300017807	Hurry it up. Every minute you take is one more that we can't afford to spend.
FO300017808	I'm all ready.
FO300017809	Okay. Don't be nervous. You'll have the whole Pride backing you up, not to mention this giant tin can.
FO300017810	Just stay safe until we reach the purifier. You're no good to us if you're dead.
FO300017811	And don't let that thing step on you.
FO300017812	I sure hope so.
FO300017813	Me too. If you need a minute to collect yourself, now's the time to do it.
FO300017814	I don't know, Sarah. I'm not so sure about this.
FO300017815	Listen, you'll be fine. You just stay behind whoever's in front of you and keep your head down.
FO300017816	We're burning daylight here. Are you ready to move out?
FO300017817	Of course I can.
FO300017818	Now that's what I like to hear, soldier.
FO300017819	You all packed? We're not coming back here anytime soon.
FO300017820	Yes, I did. And you're going to die for it.
FO300017821	Well that's a bit presumptuous, don't you think? To kill a man just for providing for his family? Everyone has to eat.
FO300017822	You know, now that you mention it, there were a bunch of bodies down there.
FO300017823	And do you have any thoughts on that?
FO300017824	You know, now that you mention it, there were a bunch of bodies in there.
FO300017825	And do you have any thoughts on that?
FO300017826	Seriously, you're talking about eating people, here. What's wrong with you?
FO300017827	I don't think I like your tone. There's nothing wrong with me, we've lived this way for decades
FO300017828	After the war, four families survived. They continued on just like we have. But when their shelters ran out of food, they need to eat something.
FO300017829	Family is everything, my friend. I wouldn't expect a wasteland wanderer like you to understand.
FO300017830	I can't believe I'm being called a potty mouth by a cannibal...
FO300017831	Okay, that's it. I warned you. Now I'm going to sock your jaw, mister.
FO300017832	Okay, that's it. I warned you. Normally, I wouldn't hit a lady, but you're over the line, missy.
FO300017833	Huh. Well, everyone's got to survive in their own way, I guess.
FO300017834	You see, now that's nice to hear. Every time someone discovers our little secret, it's always "oh, you're terrible people", or "how can you do this?"
FO300017835	I mean, I've got a family to take care of here. I've lived in Andale my whole life. And my father before me, and his father, and his father's father.
FO300017836	This town started out with just four families, and that's the way we've stayed. Small town and proud, eh?
FO300017837	Wait... are you saying you eat those people?
FO300017838	I don't think I like your tone. There's nothing wrong with me, we've lived this way for decades
FO300017839	After the war, four families survived. They continued on just like we have. But when their shelters ran out of food, they need to eat something.
FO300017840	Family is everything, my friend. I wouldn't expect a wasteland wanderer like you to understand.
FO300017841	Now, let's just forget that this happened and we'll have no problem, right?
FO300017842	Bring home the bacon? Those are people, not bacon! What the fuck?
FO300017843	Hey! I'll have none of that language in this house!
FO300017844	Yes, I was in the basement.
FO300017845	Yes. I was in the shed.
FO300017846	I almost grabbed a snack while I was there, but that would have been rude.
FO300017847	You're right, it sure would have. You know, you're a breath of fresh air. Every time someone discovers our little secret, we have to hear about it.
FO300017848	It's always "oh, how can you do this", or "you're such terrible people", or "please, not me, I have a kid in Rivet City". Well, I have kids too!
FO300017849	You're not bad, stranger. Stop on by anytime and ask Linda for one of her special meat pies.
FO300017850	I would have grabbed myself a snack while I was in there, but that'd be rude.
FO300017851	You're right, it sure would have. You know, you're a breath of fresh air. Every time someone discovers our little secret, we have to hear about it.
FO300017852	It's always "oh, how can you do this", or "you're such terrible people", or "please, not me, I have a kid in Rivet City". Well, I have kids too!
FO300017853	You're not bad, stranger. Stop on by anytime and ask Linda for one of her special meat pies.
FO300017854	You're right, it sure would have. You know, you're a breath of fresh air. Every time someone discovers our little secret, we have to hear about it.
FO300017855	It's always "oh, how can you do this", or "you're such terrible people", or "please, not me, I have a kid in Rivet City". Well, I have kids too!
FO300017856	You're not bad, stranger. Stop on by anytime and ask Linda for one of her special meat pies.
FO300017857	I would have grabbed myself a snack while I was in there, but that'd be rude.
FO300017858	You're right, it sure would have. You know, you're a breath of fresh air. Every time someone discovers our little secret, we have to hear about it.
FO300017859	It's always "oh, how can you do this", or "you're such terrible people", or "please, not me, I have a kid in Rivet City". Well, I have kids too!
FO300017860	You're not bad, stranger. Stop on by anytime and ask Linda for one of her special meat pies.
FO300017861	Yes, and I saw what you're hiding down there, you sick bastard!
FO300017862	"Judge not, lest ye be judged" as the good book says. Honestly, how many people have you killed?
FO300017863	The only difference between us is that that I'm bringing home the bacon for my family.
FO300017864	Yes, and I saw what you're hiding in there, you sick bastard!
FO300017865	"Judge not, lest ye be judged" as the good book says. Honestly, how many people have you killed?
FO300017866	The only difference between us is that that I'm bringing home the bacon for my family.
FO300017867	Tell me about Andale.
FO300017868	Why, it's a place to settle down and raise a family. Of course, we don't just let anyone in here. The home owners association is very clear on that.
FO300017869	Besides, there's no room! As amazing as Andale is, is it any wonder that all the houses would be full of happy families?
FO300017870	Andale: greatest place there is. We win town of the year every year, we've got no end of food, and no troubles at all.
FO300017871	Yep, there's no better place to raise a family.
FO300017872	Tell me about this place.
FO300017873	Oh, so you can just make fun of us again? No, thank you.
FO300017874	It's the best little town there is. We don't have a care in the world here. I mean, honestly, what more do you need to know?
FO300017875	Oh, well, no one ever asks me MY opinion about anything, but I love it here.
FO300017876	What do you think of Andale?
FO300017877	He keeps saying stuff to my mom about keeping the families going, and how when him and Mr. Wilson were brothers, they didn't want to get married.
FO300017878	I know, it's just, you know how I get: worry, worry, worry. That's me!
FO300017879	Okay, Bill. I trust you. After all, you know best.
FO300017880	Martha, darling. You always say that, you always say, "I have a bad feeling about this one," and every time, things happen like they always do.
FO300017881	Oh, darling, there's nothing to be worried about. Jack and I will take care of it. We always do.
FO300017882	That stranger is making me nervous. I don't like the looks I'm getting. Not one bit. I have a funny feeling about this whole thing.
FO300017883	Darling, what's wrong?
FO300017884	What is it, dear?
FO300017885	Hello!
FO300017886	Hi, there.
FO300017887	I'm serious. Get the hell away from me.
FO300017888	You need to know the truth, otherwise he'll suck you in just like all the others. Beware!
FO300017889	Who are you talking about?
FO300017890	He calls himself Betty now, but he's still the same. He can put on a new face all he likes, but underneath he's still evil.
FO300017891	Braun. Bastard thinks because he helped create this place he's God here. But I know he still uses the Failsafe terminal. I know it.
FO300017892	You're crazy. Get away from me.
FO300017893	What Failsafe? What the hell are you talking about?
FO300017894	It's in the abandoned house. He doesn't want us going in there, because he's afraid we might find it.
FO300017895	It's the only terminal to the outside; the only way to shut the whole thing down. You've got to find it.
FO300017896	Because anything up there has got to be better than a lifetime of the same thing down here.
FO300017897	Think about it, man. Down here, I'll always be stuck with the same job, with the same food, with the same people, forever.
FO300017898	You and your dad had the right idea: get out of this pit and make your own life.
FO300017899	Why do you need to get out of here so badly?
FO300017900	Man, screw the entire Vault, what about me?
FO300017901	Even these rebels just want the option to go outside for lousy trading and stuff. I just want to get the hell out of here for good.
FO300017902	Why stay here and be stuck as a barber for my entire life when I could go out there and make my own choices?
FO300017903	Dont worry, I'm trying to help the entire Vault.
FO300017904	MS16OtherWelcome1B
FO300017905	Because you're a goody two-shoes, right? You get off on helping people in trouble? Isn't that why you saved my mom?
FO300017906	I bet she'd thank you herself, but she and I ain't exactly on speaking terms at the moment. At least, not when she's sober.
FO300017907	But I tell you, your old man had the right idea. I can't stand it down here anymore. You gotta help me get out.
FO300017908	What makes you think I came back to help you?
FO300017909	You shut up! Just shut up and listen, okay?
FO300017910	Listen, you're about the only person who ever had the sense to get out of this place.
FO300017911	I tell you, your old man had the right idea. I can't stand it down here anymore. You gotta help me get out.
FO300017912	Oh look, Butch is begging for my help. How'd that work out for you last time?
FO300017913	What sort of help do you think I mean? You must have heard about the changes since you left, right?
FO300017914	The deaths, the lies, the whole Overseer lockdown thing? Ringing any bells?
FO300017915	Man, they'd have rushed in here long ago if they didn't know I stole one of their guns from when they issued martial law!
FO300017916	Anyway, you gotta help us get out of here. You gotta help me get out of here.
FO300017917	Help? What kind of help?
FO300017918	I'll do what I can. Just, please, help us!
FO300017919	And thanks for not giving up on us. I knew you wouldn't.
FO300017920	I'm not leaving you or the Vault to its fate. Just give me some more time.
FO300017921	Actually, I suspect that's worth testing.
FO300017922	Security! Do away with this intruder!
FO300017923	I've changed my mind. I'm staying here, and you can't stop me.
FO300017924	That's good to hear, kid. I'll do what I can to keep the door unlocked for you, but the rest is up to you.
FO300017925	On second thought, I'm not leaving this place to its fate.
FO300017926	Oh, save it. If you really cared about us, you'd be helping, instead of leaving us to our fate.
FO300017927	But please, don't let us naive vault dwellers keep you from your exciting world above. I'm sure we'll be fine, entombed down here forever.
FO300017928	I just wanted to say goodbye before I left.
FO300017929	Good. I'd hate if one of our more overzealous guards misconstrued your delay as an act of rebellion or sabotage of our vault.
FO300017930	I'm going, I'm going.
FO300017931	And here I was hoping you'd be able to help. Well, I hope you have better luck outside.
FO300017932	I'm sure we'll find a way to make it through down here on our own.
FO300017933	I can't solve your problems for you. You're on your own.
FO300017934	I'm not an idiot for wanting to leave! But I guess I wouldn't be the only one leaving. And I couldn't risk leading others to their death like that.
FO300017935	Okay, you win. Go ahead and tell the Overseer that we'll stop trying to leave the vault. You and he are right.
FO300017936	Thanks for watching out for us. We'll all miss you.
FO300017937	Don't be an idiot. Stay here where you're safe!
FO300017938	I'm not an idiot for wanting to leave! But I guess I wouldn't be the only one leaving. And I couldn't risk leading others to their death like that.
FO300017939	Okay, you win. Go ahead and tell the Overseer that we'll stop trying to leave the vault. You and he are right.
FO300017940	Thanks for watching out for us. We'll all miss you.
FO300017941	Don't be an idiot. Stay here where you're safe!
FO300017942	And you expect me to believe that the only way to do that is to let them travel out in the Wastes and mingle with those savages?
FO300017943	I suppose it would allow them to stay alive, and we could still keep the Vault as our safe haven. But it'd require a new type of leader.
FO300017944	And I know only one person with the proper attitude to do that. I'll inform my daughter Amata that she is the new Overseer, effective immediately.
FO300017945	The only mission your Vault ever had was keeping its residents alive.
FO300017946	I'm not afraid of dying... But if I leave, others will try to follow. And I couldn't live with their deaths on my conscience.
FO300017947	Okay, you win. Go ahead and tell my father that we'll stop trying to leave the vault. You and he are right.
FO300017948	Thanks for watching out for us. We'll all miss you.
FO300017949	I'm not afraid of dying... But if I leave, others will try to follow. And I couldn't live with their deaths on my conscience.
FO300017950	Okay, you win. Go ahead and tell the Overseer that we'll stop trying to leave the vault. You and he are right.
FO300017951	Thanks for watching out for us. We'll all miss you.
FO300017952	I wish I could share your optimism. But I suppose you have a point, in your blathering way.
FO300017953	My way won't save our Vault's mission. But if I let them contact the outside world, I might be able to save its inhabitants.
FO300017954	But I'm not the one to lead them in that. I'm stepping down as Overseer. I'll tell Amata that I can think of no more appropriate leader than she.
FO300017955	Humanity isn't about pure genetics. It's about never giving up hope, even now.
FO300017956	This has been fun, but I've got things to do.
FO300017957	Don't let me keep you.
FO300017958	Zombies couldn't make a place like Underworld.
FO300017959	See? I knew you understood Ghouls.
FO300017960	You've convinced me. Hand over your keys and password, and I'll be on my way.
FO300017961	Do you think I'm scared of a snotnosed punk like you? I was running this Vault when you were still crying for your dead mother.
FO300017962	You'll get nothing from me. I'll die before I see the safety of the Vault compromised again.
FO300017963	I'm afraid the Vault will just have to get along without you. Time to die.
FO300017964	Do you really think I'm afraid of a little snotnose punk like you?
FO300017965	I've dealt with your kind many times before. I've never minded getting my hands dirty when I had to.
FO300017966	All right. We'll do it your way. I surrender. <Give him your weapons.>
FO300017967	Thank you. That will make this easier. Guards! Help me!
FO300017968	My father's no traitor. But you're a murderer and a thug.
FO300017969	Let's let history be the judge of that. If you had paid attention to Mr. Brotch, you'd understand that history is invariably written by the victor.
FO300017970	And I intend to be the victor. You won't survive the night. Guards! Help me!
FO300017971	Is that what you said to Jonas before you killed him? Time to die, old man.
FO300017972	A regrettable incident. But sometimes harsh measures are necessary for the good of the Vault. Such has always been my lot.
FO300017973	Think a moment. If you really care about your fellow citizens, killing me is the worst thing you could do.
FO300017974	Without an Overseer, the Vault would be plunged into chaos and disaster. Surely you can see that as well as I.
FO300017975	Come now, turn yourself in and we can resolve this whole thing peacefully. Just because your father betrayed us doesn't mean you have to.
FO300017976	So cynical! No, no, I can take care of all that with a few traders I know. What makes you think I'd force you to handle something so dangerous?
FO300017977	Now, you should just lie back and bask in the praise for helping with the book!
FO300017978	Let me guess. You need me to go print and distribute it, right?
FO300017979	Old Man Harris doesn't seen very happy.
FO300017980	He stays locked up in his house all day and the girls bring him his meals. He barely eats enough to stay alive. Poor guy, he's all skin and bones.
FO300017981	Yeah, well, he's hit it rough. Ever since his wife died, he just hasn't been enthusiastic about the Andale lifestyle anymore.
FO300017982	He stays locked up in his house all day and the girls bring him his meals. He barely eats enough to stay alive. Poor guy, he's all skin and bones.
FO300017983	Doesn't that make you all cousins?
FO300017984	I can't say that I know what you're talking about, but I sure as heck don't like your tone. You've got no business coming in here and judging us.
FO300017985	We're four hard working American families. I work hard to put food on the table for my family, so do all the men here.
FO300017986	It's not easy living the American dream but dammit, we're doing the best we can.
FO300017987	I guess it's none of my business.
FO300017988	Well, you know what they say about curiosity, cats, and killing. Just be careful where you stick your nose. We're private people.
FO300017989	No, I mean, really close.
FO300017990	Oh, someone spilled our beans, didn't they? Well, Andale has been four families and only four families for a very long time.
FO300017991	Two families marry into one another, take a new name, and start a new life. There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
FO300017992	I guess there are worse things.
FO300017993	Oh, someone spilled our beans, didn't they? Well, Andale has been four families and only four families for a very long time.
FO300017994	Two families marry into one another, take a new name, and start a new life. There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
FO300017995	The families around here seem very close.
FO300017996	Oh, we are. Absolutely. Family first, here in Andale.
FO300017997	The families around here seem... umm... closer than most.
FO300017998	Oh, we are. Absolutely. Family first, here in Andale.
FO300017999	It's true. And they smell funny.
FO300018000	I was just joking. It's a lovely place.
FO300018001	Well, I don't think it was a very funny joke. But thank you, we ladies to try to keep it as nice as we can.
FO300018002	But enough about us, did you need something?
FO300018003	Actually, I guess it isn't so bad.
FO300018004	Well, I think that it's quite a bit more than that, but thank you anyway. Now, did you need something?
FO300018005	I'm from an underground Vault, lady. Trust me, this place sucks.
FO300018006	Well... I never! The nerve of some people! At least some of us know how to take the high road.
FO300018007	Did you want something, Mr. Fancy Underground Vault, or did you just come here to turn your nose up at us?
FO300018008	Well... I never! The nerve of some people! At least some of us know how to take the high road.
FO300018009	Did you want something, Miss Fancy Underground Vault, or did you just come here to turn your nose up at us?
FO300018010	I think "weird as all hell" is probably the best way to describe it.
FO300018011	Oh my gosh! You said a swear! I'm telling! And that's four words, stupid.
FO300018012	A couple? Is that what you mean?
FO300018013	Yes! That's it! We'll be a great couple!
FO300018014	I'm sure you two will be great together.
FO300018015	Okay, this is boring.
FO300018016	Didn't your mother teach you any manners?
FO300018017	Well, that's not very polite at all!
FO300018018	How rude! You could have at least let me finish!
FO300018019	Yeah, he's a pretty smart guy.
FO300018020	I knew it! Even you think he's smarter than you!
FO300018021	I don't know, he doesn't seem very smart to me.
FO300018022	Wow, what a jerk! You're lucky that I don't tell him what you said!
FO300018023	I really don't care.
FO300018024	I really don't know.
FO300018025	My daddy is never wrong. Ever. He's the smartest man in the whole world. Smarter than you.
FO300018026	Well, okay then. Nothing to worry about.
FO300018027	Poor guy, it's so sad when senility sets in.
FO300018028	He said you were all crazy killers.
FO300018029	Did he, now? I've talked to him before about spreading rumors. I guess I'll just have to have another little chat with him.
FO300018030	Every time he does this, he scares our new friends off, and we love people! It's a shame when they slip out of our grubby little paws! Ha!
FO300018031	What's wrong with that Harris guy?
FO300018032	Oh, that old kidder? Whatever he's saying, he's just pulling your leg. He's always joking, that one.
FO300018033	Has he been spreading his stories again? Poor guy. I'll just have to have Jack give him a talking to.
FO300018034	Well, dad always was a bit off his rocker.
FO300018035	What? You don't believe me? Just look in the basements! Or out in that shed! You'll see what I mean!
FO300018036	Well, I'll be careful, I guess.
FO300018037	You should! Otherwise, you'll end up just like the rest!
FO300018038	What? You don't believe me? Just look in the basements! Or out in that shed! You'll see what I mean!
FO300018039	You're right. I hate friendly people.
FO300018040	And you're right sensible to. Especially around here. The friendly neighbor bit is just an act, these people are stone cold killers!
FO300018041	Get out while you can! Just get as far away from here as possible!
FO300018042	Now, I know what you're thinking, and don't bother. We're perfectly happy good Christian people here, and we've been that way for 200 years.
FO300018043	All the men work hard to put food on the table and all the women work hard to make nice homes for us. That's the way it should be.
FO300018044	This is America, and I'll be damned if I let some Chinese Commies ruin that with a few bombs!
FO300018045	What's wrong with being friendly?
FO300018046	You just watch your back around here! And get out while you can!
FO300018047	Just about everyone in the wasteland knows to avoid Andale, and they're right to do it. People wander in here, and they don't wander back out.
FO300018048	Well, I haven't talked to anyone here but you. Are they friendly?
FO300018049	Just about everyone in the wasteland knows to avoid Andale, and they're right to do it. People wander in here, and they don't wander back out.
FO300018050	Well, I haven't talked to anyone here but you. Are they friendly?
FO300018051	Of course there's something off about them, everyone knows to avoid Andale! The caravans know it, the Raiders know it, even the Radscorpions know it.
FO300018052	Folks wander into this place, and they don't wander back out. Oh sure, it seems nice, a regular town of out time here, but don't let it fool you.
FO300018053	If you know what's good for you, you'll get out as soon as you can. They're crazy! Crazy, I tell you!
FO300018054	I don't know, it seems like a pretty nice place to me.
FO300018055	Well, they're not! They're killers! Every one of 'em! Run! Get out while you can!
FO300018056	Don't believe me, do you? Just check out the basement, or that shed! There's a reason they're locked!
FO300018057	Whoa, slow down, grandpa. What's wrong?
FO300018058	What's wrong? You don't see anything wrong with a quiet little town full of friendly people in the middle of a blasted wasteland?
FO300018059	What, what?
FO300018060	Oh! Silly me, I mean "preparing a meal for you". Just a crazy twist of the tongue! Haha! Well, gotta go, bye!
FO300018061	This dump? Are you serious?
FO300018062	Well, now. I'm sure that your home town is just so so much better than our little Andale.
FO300018063	Well, I can certainly see why.
FO300018064	Why thank you! That's so nice of you to say! You're just too sweet.
FO300018065	But forgive me, did you want to ask me something?
FO300018066	Best town in the USA? How many towns compete in that contest?
FO300018067	So, like I was saying, welcome to Andale. What can the Smith family do for you?
FO300018068	Suit yourself, but you don't know what you're missing.
FO300018069	Linda's meatloaf is the best in the county. And her mince meat pie has won first prize at the town fair three years running.
FO300018070	But the invitation still stands, if you ever change your mind. But listen to me go on, did you need something else?
FO300018071	Thanks, Jack. Maybe I'll do that.
FO300018072	I hope to see you there! So, did you need anything else?
FO300018073	Ah, I get it! You're crazy.
FO300018074	No, sir. Not crazy, just a loyal American.
FO300018075	No, ma'am. Not crazy, just a loyal American.
FO300018076	Well, okay then.
FO300018077	Yessir, democracy is God's best gift, right after family, of course.
FO300018078	Well, that's a shame. But feel free to stop by and see us anytime!
FO300018079	Well, it's good to meet you, Jack.
FO300018080	And it's good to meet you too! Feel free to stay in Andale as long as you'd like. Heck, stop by the house for dinner sometime if you'd like.
FO300018081	Just let Linda know beforehand, so that she can make enough for four!
FO300018082	Virginia? Virginia's been gone for 200 years.
FO300018083	Not here. Not in Andale, no sir. The great Commonwealth of Virginia is alive and well. In fact, we just voted ourselves a new governor!
FO300018084	Not here. Not in Andale, no ma'am. The great Commonwealth of Virginia is alive and well. In fact, we just voted ourselves a new governor!
FO300018085	The adults walked right on down to the polling location and dropped ballots into the box. How do you think it works?
FO300018086	Yessir, it's every American's civic duty to cast his vote for his favorite Republican candidate. Am I right?
FO300018087	You voted for governor? How does that work?
FO300018088	Now, now, my vote is my business and no one else's. But I'll tell you one thing: we didn't vote for any beatnik liberal commies, that's for sure.
FO300018089	So who did you vote for?
FO300018090	Like I told you last time, the last one I gave you was it. I am fresh out of them. Sorry.
FO300018091	I guess that ends our relationship. Thanks for all you've done.
FO300018092	Well, this is the last one I have. If you lose this, you're shit out of luck.
FO300018093	Okay, but I only have two left. So try and be more careful.
FO300018094	Yeah, my equipment has seen better days.
FO300018095	Well, let me see what I can do about that.
FO300018096	I think we can do something about that.
FO300018097	No problem, lemme have a look.
FO300018098	I have some mapping data for you.
FO300018099	Excellent! Let me offload the data and I'll be glad to pay you.
FO300018100	Hmmm. You need to actually collect some new data before I can pay you.
FO300018101	We already have all these locations in the system.
FO300018102	Well, without the Geomapper, I can't get the data from your Pip-Boy. Where the heck is it?
FO300018103	As long as the caps flow, you'll get your maps.
FO300018104	Here, take this geomapper. Please don't lose it. Donovan spent a year developing it and I only have a few.
FO300018105	It will offload all of the map data you collect from your Pip-Boy automatically. When you come back, I can take the data from it and you get paid.
FO300018106	Done deal. I'll locate as many as I can for you.
FO300018107	Here, take this geomapper. Please don't lose it. Donovan spent a year developing it and I only have a few.
FO300018108	It will offload all of the map data you collect from your Pip-Boy automatically. When you come back, I can take the data from it and you get paid.
FO300018109	Well, yeah. I expect to be paid a merc's wage, though.
FO300018110	Don't worry, I'll compensate you for your time.
FO300018111	For every map marker you uncover in the Capital Wasteland, I'll pay you a fair sum in bottlecaps.
FO300018112	All you have to do is find them, come back here and I'll get them off your Pip-Boy there.
FO300018113	Sure. Why not. You look like you need the help.
FO300018114	For every map marker you uncover in the Capital Wasteland, I'll pay you a fair sum in bottlecaps.
FO300018115	All you have to do is find them, come back here and I'll get them off your Pip-Boy there.
FO300018116	Well, looks like you're on your own then.
FO300018117	Yeah. On my own as usual. Sigh.
FO300018118	Look, why don't you come back later. I don't need pity right now.
FO300018119	Let me help. You stay here and I'll do some mapping for you.
FO300018120	You'd risk your neck for me like that?
FO300018121	Theo died because he was careless.
FO300018122	I just hope that I can get back to mapping the ruins soon. I have a lot of contacts that are demanding I finish.
FO300018123	No, Theo died because of bad luck. That's all.
FO300018124	Thanks. You're sweet to try and make me feel better about everything.
FO300018125	I just hope that I can get back to mapping the ruins soon. I have a lot of contacts that are demanding I finish.
FO300018126	Thanks. It's nice of you to try and make me feel better about everything.
FO300018127	I just hope that I can get back to mapping the ruins soon. I have a lot of contacts that are demanding I finish.
FO300018128	Shit happens, Reilly. Get used to it.
FO300018129	Well a lot of shit happened all because of me.
FO300018130	We lost Theo because I was stupid enough to retreat into the hospital.
FO300018131	We all make mistakes, Reilly. You're not a fortune teller.
FO300018132	Yeah, but I led the guys right into a corner. Theo died because I decided to take shelter in the hospital.
FO300018133	I'm not so sure I'd be trusted leading anyone at this point.
FO300018134	What's been happening since you've been back?
FO300018135	Oh wow, Reilly snapped out of her slump now that you're mapping for the Rangers.
FO300018136	Now we go out and kick ass like the old days. Ooh-rah!
FO300018137	Not much really. Reilly is taking it easy for a while until she gets back into shape. She looks ready to rock in my opinion, but I'm no doctor.
FO300018138	I'm kind of itching to get out of here, but she still calls the shots. Something has her spooked.
FO300018139	Now that you're part of the team, Reilly is her old self again.
FO300018140	We've been vaporizing hostiles like there's no tomorrow!
FO300018141	Me and ole' Eugene have been a bit sad lately. No Super Mutants to mow down.
FO300018142	I guess as soon as Reilly's ready, we can head back out into the ruins. I wish I knew what she was waiting for.
FO300018143	Things seem better now. Reilly's gained back her confidence a bit. We've been doing stuff here and there.
FO300018144	I don't know what you said to her, but thanks.
FO300018145	Frankly, I'm bored to tears. I think the last incident has Reilly a bit on edge.
FO300018146	She says she wants to wait until she's in top shape, but I think she's fine.
FO300018147	I don't know what's holding her back.
FO300018148	Well, I've been feeling a little more confident now that I have you mapping for us.
FO300018149	I think we'll head out into the ruins and do some search & destroy to ease back into things.
FO300018150	I don't know. I'm not sure I'm cut out for this kind of job anymore.
FO300018151	I almost got everyone killed in Vernon Square. What kind of responsible leader does that? It was one bad decision after another.
FO300018152	Same as last time you asked.
FO300018153	I just hope that I can get back to mapping the ruins soon. I have a lot of contacts that are demanding I finish.
FO300018154	Yeah, I think I'm hurt.
FO300018155	That's funny, you look fine to me. Maybe you should just get some rest.
FO300018156	Yeah, you look like you need some work.
FO300018157	All right, hang in there. Let me see what I can do for you.
FO300018158	I'll consider rescuing them. I'm assuming there's some kind of reward?
FO300018159	I don't make promises. And I don't risk my life for free.
FO300018160	Just what I thought. You're a mercenary. We don't need you. Go on up there to die if you like. But don't say you're doing it for us!
FO300018161	I got what it takes to rescue your friends, but it's going to cost you.
FO300018162	Rescue whoever the hell you like, but they aren't my friends. I don't NEED friends. Though I'm sure someone will pay you if you succeed.
FO300018163	I'll rescue your friends, but its going to cost you.
FO300018164	Oh that's wonderful! Thank you so much! We don't have much, but if you can bring them back alive, we'll give you everything we can!
FO300018165	Don't worry. If they're alive, I'll find them and rescue them.
FO300018166	That's totally awesome! Yeah! Okay. While you're out on your mission, I'll stay here and hold down the fort. Cool!
FO300018167	Hey, did I show you my new gun? It's totally awesome.
FO300018168	You stay here and hold off any more Mutants. I'll go rescue your friends.
FO300018169	Quit moping around. I'll rescue your friends!
FO300018170	Hah! Think you're all that, huh? Well, it's your own funeral. I certainly won't be attending.
FO300018171	I'll rescue your friends just to see the smile on your face when they return!
FO300018172	MS01QuestHook3
FO300018173	Your friends will have to rescue themselves. I'm not going to.
FO300018174	Your friends are as good as dead. Forget about them.
FO300018175	I knew it. You're just like all the others.
FO300018176	No, I'm not going to rescue your friends.
FO300018177	Your friends are dead. Maybe you can channel them from the afterlife? Freak.
FO300018178	You mean like where they took them? I don't know exactly... Um... to the north. Northeast to be more precise. You're going to rescue them?!
FO300018179	Yep. Growing up sucks. Now... do you actually know anything useful?
FO300018180	Intel? What's intel? I can tell you they went north towards the Germantown police station, if that's what you mean. You going to rescue them?
FO300018181	Yeah, I get it. You're a real soldier. So you got any intel on the enemy?
FO300018182	Hold on there! I never said I didn't care. I just know there isn't anyone foolish enough to go up to Germantown. Why, you think you can rescue them?
FO300018183	If you don't care about your friends, then I guess I won't rescue them.
FO300018184	They took them to Germantown. Probably to that old police station. Why you got a death wish?
FO300018185	MS01QuestHook1
FO300018186	They took them to the north, to the police station or something. Do you think you can find them? And rescue them?
FO300018187	Settle down now. It'll be okay. Do you know where they took them?
FO300018188	You going to rescue them, or what?
FO300018189	Do you know where these Super Mutants took their victims?
FO300018190	They took 'em north to that old police station... in Germantown... No use in going up there though. They've already been eaten, or worse, by now.
FO300018191	Why? You thinking about performing a miracle and rescuing their sorry butts?
FO300018192	Don't lose hope. Do you know where the Super Mutants are located?
FO300018193	Wow, you need therapy. Look, do you know where your friends are?
FO300018194	What do you know about these Super Mutants?
FO300018195	Oh, they're somewhere to the northeast. In a police station or something. Thanks for rescuing our friends!
FO300018196	Do you know where the Super Mutants took your friends?
FO300018197	Try Germantown. They always come from up that way. Bring lots of guns and shoot the hell out of those Muties! I'll hold down the fort here.
FO300018198	Do you know where the Super Mutants took your friends?
FO300018199	Well if you feel like dying, go right on ahead. They're up there at some police station near Germantown. Good luck. You're gonna need it.
FO300018200	Do you know where the Super Mutants took your friends?
FO300018201	Do you know where the Super Mutants took your friends?
FO300018202	Have you changed your mind? Are you going to rescue our friends! I'd given up hope. It's so hard here in the Wasteland. Not like when we were young.
FO300018203	Hah! You've decided to help rescue our friends? Unlikely. You probably just figured out a way to take advantage of the situation. Bah!
FO300018204	Have you changed your mind? Are you going to rescue them?! I mean, not that I care or anything. They aren't really my friends anyway.
FO300018205	Just walking corpses waiting to die like the rest of us.
FO300018206	I thought growing up was a good thing. You got to leave and explore the real world. Well, what nobody tells you is that the real world sucks!
FO300018207	But now she and the others are gone. Super Mutants attacked and carried them off! No one knows when they're coming back. Or who'll be next.
FO300018208	What? You never seen a Super Mutant before?! They're mean and ugly and scary as hell!
FO300018209	They came and rounded up a bunch of us and carried them off! God! They must be doing awful things to them.
FO300018210	I'd go rescue them, but then who'd defend Big Town? I patrol every day now.
FO300018211	And I got a little present for those muties when they come back. You know what it is? This kick-ass gun. That's what! Yeah baby!
FO300018212	The only thing you need to know is that we're all doomed! Sooner or later they'll get every last one of us.
FO300018213	And what are you supposed to be anyway? Some kind of hero here to rescue our friends from the Muties? Bah! You're just here to cause trouble.
FO300018214	Ever wonder what it'd be like to slit your wrist? I watched someone die once. So I'm an expert on death. And so are many of my friends now.
FO300018215	Now that Mutants took them.
FO300018216	Unless someone can figure out how to rescue them.
FO300018217	Okay, what's on your mind?
FO300018218	Just give it up, Gob. You're not going to get anything.
FO300018219	You just leave that fucking thing alone, Gob?
FO300018220	Boy, just leave it be. I like the Enclave station. It's downright patriotic!
FO300018221	Hello, Mrs. Wilson.
FO300018222	Good to see you, Mrs. Wilson.
FO300018223	My mom says hi, Mrs. Wilson.
FO300018224	Hi, Mr. Wilson.
FO300018225	Good to see you, Mr. Wilson.
FO300018226	Touch me and I yell zombie.
FO300018227	My dear friend, yelling "zombie" in Underworld would be like yelling "sand" in a desert. Pointless.
FO300018228	Obviously, you take no appreciation in what I am trying to achieve. Please, leave me be. I have much to do.
FO300018229	Sorry, I aim to keep all my samples to myself.
FO300018230	Pity. Well then, what can I do for you?
FO300018231	No, no. Nothing like that.
FO300018232	Shame. Then what can I do for you?
FO300018233	Stay away from me, you freak!
FO300018234	That's just the attitude I've come to expect from most people.
FO300018235	All of my experiments are done by the book and scientifically.
FO300018236	What do you mean "fresh human samples"?
FO300018237	You haven't heard? I'm the foremost authority on Ghoul evolution. I want to know what makes us tick.
FO300018238	Something doomed us to this rotting form, and I aim to discover what it is.
FO300018239	So, I need samples of human skin, organs and other parts to make the experiments valid.
FO300018240	It's all here. <Give 100 Caps.>
FO300018241	Fine. This will just take a second.
FO300018242	Shouldn't take but a moment. Hold still please.
FO300018243	Sigh. Come back when you do.
FO300018244	Oops. I don't have that much. Sorry.
FO300018245	Here you go. <Give 200 Caps.>
FO300018246	Thanks. Now hold still, you don't want me to slip when holding sharp objects.
FO300018247	Good, good. Now let's see if we can fix you up quickly.
FO300018248	I'm not a charity worker. Come back when you have the caps, and we'll do business.
FO300018249	Oops. I don't have that much. Sorry.
FO300018250	Okay, here are the caps. <Give 300 Caps.>
FO300018251	Good. Now, hold still. This is going to hurt like hell.
FO300018252	Bite down, this is going to smart.
FO300018253	Sigh. Come back when you do!
FO300018254	Oops. I don't have that much. Sorry.
FO300018255	Well, I'm not a charity worker. Especially with humans. You want me to fix you up, bring caps next time.
FO300018256	I'm injured. Anything you can do for me?
FO300018257	Certainly, we can help you. Please speak to Doctor Barrows.
FO300018258	Wait here.
FO300018259	Don't be long!
FO300018260	They're worshipping a tree? Ha ha ha!
FO300018261	Well, truth be told it's Herbert that's the tree. He sorta just took over, you know? Probably to get back at me for calling him Herbert all the time.
FO300018262	His name's really Bob. I think it's funny when I call him Herbert though.
FO300018263	Okay. What's the trick? I know there's a guy with a microphone somewhere.
FO300018264	Where? You mean in here? Nah, it's just me and Herbert. He's the tree.
FO300018265	Well, his name's really Bob. I think it's funny to call him Herbert. But I don't think he thinks it's that funny.
FO300018266	I've never met a talking tree before.
FO300018267	Neither have I. Well, I mean I talk to Herbert, but he never really says anything back.
FO300018268	He kept growing around me, maybe for calling him Herbert all the time. His name's really Bob. I think it's funny when I call him Herbert though.
FO300018269	<Sigh> I wish I was too. Then me and Herbert could be the best of friends and live side by side.
FO300018270	Well, his name's really Bob. I think it's funny to call him Herbert. But I don't think he thinks it's that funny.
FO300018271	The front desk computer has access to the card catalogs, but it appears that it's lost the connection to the main archives. Here's the password.
FO300018272	Now, you might be able to find the central computer further in there, but I'm afraid you'll have to do that without me. I'm a scholar, not a fighter.
FO300018273	Can you help me access the library's archives?
FO300018274	MS03QuestCompletedB
FO300018275	I know it was a lot to ask, but we made a great piece! And it's bound to help humanity, you know.
FO300018276	I'll share these with the traders, and soon, everyone will know about the Wasteland Survival Guide!
FO300018277	But before that, here's your complimentary copy, complete with my compliments. Good work, Wasteland survival assistant!
FO300018278	I'm just glad I can stop getting stabbed, irradiated, and shot for your science.
FO300018279	And if it wasn't for that fearless fortitude and sacrifice for science, it wouldn't have been made. It'll be a tremendous boon to humanity, you know.
FO300018280	I'll share these with the traders, and soon, everyone will know about the Wasteland Survival Guide!
FO300018281	I went through a lot of pain for that. It had better be worth it.
FO300018282	I'll share these with the traders, and soon, everyone will know about the Wasteland Survival Guide!
FO300018283	I should hope so. I nearly killed myself a half dozen times for that thing.
FO300018284	MS03QuestCompletedA
FO300018285	Looks good! I mean, it could be better, but nothing's perfect. And it's not like bad advice ever hurt anyone, right?
FO300018286	I'll share these with the traders, and soon, everyone will know about the Wasteland Survival Guide!
FO300018287	But before that, here's your complimentary copy, complete with my compliments. Good work, Wasteland survival assistant!
FO300018288	It was hardly any work at all. How's it look?
FO300018289	Oh, it's great! Why, with the information here, we'll save hundreds of lives. Maybe even thousands!
FO300018290	I'll share these with the traders, and soon, everyone will know about the Wasteland Survival Guide!
FO300018291	Thanks, I'm pretty proud of it. So how's the final product?
FO300018292	I'll share these with the traders, and soon, everyone will know about the Wasteland Survival Guide!
FO300018293	It certainly was an epic piece of work. So, is the final product worth it?
FO300018294	MS03RCHistory2Special
FO300018295	Why, that lying son of a bitch! He wasn't even born when I got here!
FO300018296	Wanna know this tub's history? Only person who really knows it is Pinkerton. And most think he's dead or gone.
FO300018297	He's holed up in the other half of the ship, and he don't like visitors. He'll set you straight.
FO300018298	Really? Because Bannon said he organized the entire place himself.
FO300018299	Why, that lying son of a bitch! He wasn't even born when I got here!
FO300018300	Wanna know this tub's history? Only person who really knows it is Pinkerton. And he's dead, so you're outta luck.
FO300018301	Probably some old notes in his shed down in the other half of the ship. You want to grab them, have a blast.
FO300018302	Really? Because Bannon said he organized the entire place himself.
FO300018303	She did? Well, I suppose I have picked up a lot over the years. I mean, no one's spent more time tinkering on this old girl than I have!
FO300018304	Anyway, you might find some clues in Pinkerton's place, in the broken-off bow. He was around before me, and used to store stuff there before he left.
FO300018305	Vera spoke very highly of you. She says you know all about this place.
FO300018306	Hah! Sounds like you've been poking around, all right. I'm surprised any of those reprobates even remember me.
FO300018307	Maybe they still laugh about how they edged me out of the council, back then. But you can set the record straight!
FO300018308	I hear you're the only one who knows the truth about Rivet City's founding.
FO300018309	Why, that lying, dead son of a bitch! He wasn't even born when I got here! And looks like he didn't make it to see the end of the place, neither.
FO300018310	Wanna know this tub's history? Only one can give you any real answers is that old bastard Pinkerton. As is, most think he's dead or gone.
FO300018311	He's holed up in the broken-off bow of the ship, and he don't like visitors. But if it'll get you the fuck out of my face, go have a blast!
FO300018312	Really? Because Bannon said he organized the entire place himself.
FO300018313	Why, that lying, dead son of a bitch! He wasn't even born when I got here! And looks like he didn't make it to see the end of the place, neither.
FO300018314	Wanna know this tub's history? Only one could've given you any real answers was that old bastard Pinkerton.
FO300018315	Probably some old notes in his shed down in the broken-off bow of the ship. But if it'll get you the fuck out of my face, go have a blast!
FO300018316	Really? Because Bannon said he organized the entire place himself.
FO300018317	MS03RivetCityHistory2B
FO300018318	Well, yes, but it was hardly anyplace of importance until I arrived on the scene. That's all ancient history now. No one would ever care about it.
FO300018319	If you insist on wasting your time on that, you could try that bartending old crone down below, Belle Bonny.
FO300018320	Hasn't Rivet City been around for longer than twelve years?
FO300018321	Well, yes, but it was hardly anyplace of importance until I arrived on the scene. That's all ancient history now. No one would ever care about it.
FO300018322	If you're going to waste someone's time on that, go bother that idiot, Seagrave Holmes. He spends all his time in the bowels of this place.
FO300018323	Hasn't Rivet City been around for longer than twelve years?
FO300018324	Well, yes, but it was hardly anyplace of importance until I arrived on the scene. That's all ancient history now. No one would ever care about it.
FO300018325	Hasn't Rivet City been around for longer than twelve years?
FO300018326	Technicalities, technicalities. Stop wasting your time and mine with questions about ancient history.
FO300018327	Hasn't Rivet City been around for longer than twelve years?
FO300018328	Actually, now that you mention it, Seagrave may know more about it.
FO300018329	He's been here since he was just a boy, and I can't imagine anyone knows this ship better than he does.
FO300018330	Well, is there anyone who knows more?
FO300018331	Well, Seagrave may have known more, but that's all in the past, now.
FO300018332	Well, is there anyone who knows more?
FO300018333	No, I can't fucking well share one! What sort of moron are you?
FO300018334	But, fine, if it'll get you out of my face: go down to Pinkerton's shed in the broken-off bow of the ship.
FO300018335	If he decides to give you a history lesson, it's no business of mine. Now get the hell out of my bar.
FO300018336	I bet someone like you hears lots of stories. Can't you share one?
FO300018337	No, I can't fucking well share one! What sort of moron are you?
FO300018338	But, fine, if it'll get you out of my face: go down to Pinkerton's shed in the broken-off bow of the ship.
FO300018339	He may be dead, rest his fucking soul, but the cantankerous bastard would've wanted things set straight.
FO300018340	I bet someone like you hears lots of stories. Can't you share one?
FO300018341	No. Now get.
FO300018342	I bet someone like you hears lots of stories. Can't you share one?
FO300018343	Last feller I remember from back then was Mr. Pinkerton, and he must've left about a decade ago, after that spat with the science team.
FO300018344	He used to have a storage shed in the broken-off bow of the ship; we always thought he was crazy for keeping stuff there.
FO300018345	Might have kept a couple records down there, I guess. Careful, though; ship's a bit treacherous down there in her belly!
FO300018346	Can you think of anyone from back then that might know more?
FO300018347	Feh. I know lots of things, but you've got no idea about most of them. Now get going, before I stop talking and start shooting!
FO300018348	Precisely! After sponsoring the settlement and organizing the city council, I took my rightful place at its head.
FO300018349	Oh, of course we're all "equals" there. People would complain if we didn't at least say that. But you and I know better, don't we?
FO300018350	That makes sense. And it explains why you're on the Council.
FO300018351	Well, if it'll help. I once heard that this place was covered in Mirelurks fifty years ago, raiding all around the city.
FO300018352	Eventually, some poor soul they thought would be lunch fought back, and cleared out the whole ship. He set up the city in their place.
FO300018353	They say he was the first councilor for the upper deck and lived here to his death. Can't say I believe it a bit, but it's a nice tale to tell.
FO300018354	Could you at least tell me what you've heard?
FO300018355	Oh, sure. See, it's tied into the story about how Sister got his name. You ask him about that. He'll clear up all your problems. For good.
FO300018356	Hell, take a dive off the flight deck while you're at it. Long as you stop pissing away my time.
FO300018357	Well, can't you tell me anything about it?
FO300018358	Oh, well, the old girl had seen a lot of damage, especially where the Mirelurks used to nest, and where the Super Mutants kept trying to get in.
FO300018359	I guess the Mutants and the Mires got so busy fighting each other, it gave us the time we needed to make this place ship shape.
FO300018360	Does that tell you what you need to know? Anyway, we're here in Rivet City, and she's in good hands, now.
FO300018361	Well, what can you tell me about the reconstruction?
FO300018362	Like I care what you savages read? Shove off and leave an old man to rest in peace.
FO300018363	Please, it's very important. It's for a book about the Wasteland.
FO300018364	Could I ask you about Rivet City's history?
FO300018365	Oh, it's not the past of the city that I dwell upon, but the future of its inhabitants.
FO300018366	But if you're interested, I believe Miss Weatherly would be glad to speak with you on the subject.
FO300018367	What do you know about Rivet City's history?
FO300018368	Oh, it's not the past of the city that I dwell upon, but the future of its inhabitants.
FO300018369	What do you know about Rivet City's history?
FO300018370	So? Who cares about that old coot, or his pathetic story? It's people like me that have turned his little "science station" into someplace great.
FO300018371	You lied to me about Rivet City's history! Pinkerton told me the truth!
FO300018372	Why, I practically set this whole place up. When I got here twelve years ago, it was just a handful of dead-enders squatting in a rusted-out rowboat.
FO300018373	Now I'm on the council, and with my leadership, we're the strongest settlement in the Wastes!
FO300018374	Of course, a few of those dead-enders still stick around, but who'd want to leave?
FO300018375	Well, I could tell you all about my hotel, but I'm sure I don't know anything about how Rivet City itself got started.
FO300018376	I mean, you hear rumors, and you make guesses, but I really couldn't say I know for sure. And I'd hate to lead you down the wrong path.
FO300018377	Do you know anything about Rivet City's history?
FO300018378	History? What, not enough shit around here already, you need to dig up more?
FO300018379	Don't know if it ever had an official start. It's just been here forever, stuck in the river and full of assholes.
FO300018380	Have any stories about this place's history?
FO300018381	Oh, I really wouldn't know. I mean, long as I can remember, she's just been here, soaking up all the repairs and attention we can give her.
FO300018382	I grabbed a wrench and joined in the reconstruction pretty much first thing out of the womb, but I never really cared about the politics.
FO300018383	What do you know about Rivet City's history?
FO300018384	What? I have better things to do than yak about those back-stabbers up topside. Now get going!
FO300018385	Tell me about this city's history.
FO300018386	I could tell you all about the science lab, but even though I was here near the start, I can't really help with the details of how it all worked out.
FO300018387	It all seems like a lifetime ago, and I'm afraid I've had a lot of things on my mind since those early days.
FO300018388	What do you know about this city's history?
FO300018389	I don't exactly have time to worry about the history around here, now do I? I've got to worry about what's happening on it now.
FO300018390	Do you know about Rivet City's history?
FO300018391	'Fraid I can't help you, pal. Been here for years, but all I know about the history is that it's a safe place to settle down.
FO300018392	Maybe Bannon can help you out. He sure acts like he knows it all.
FO300018393	Know anything about the history of Rivet City?
FO300018394	'Fraid I can't help you, pal. Been here for years, but all I know about the history is that it's a safe place to settle down.
FO300018395	Know anything about the history of Rivet City?
FO300018396	History? Fuck if I know. Hell, fuck if I care.
FO300018397	Can I ask you about Rivet City's history?
FO300018398	Get away. I've got enough to deal with without you wasting my time.
FO300018399	Heard any stories about the city's history?
FO300018400	Yeah, dad built it to fight off the Mirelurks! And that's why they're all gone, now!
FO300018401	Heard any stories about the city's history?
FO300018402	James says his dad built it, but I don't know. I think he's making stuff up.
FO300018403	Do you know anything about the city's history?
FO300018404	James used to say his dad built it. He always used to come up with the best stories.
FO300018405	Do you know anything about the city's history?
FO300018406	Born and raised on the hangar deck, but don't hold that against him. He can't help where he came from, and his heart's in the right place.
FO300018407	What do you know about Rivet City's history?
FO300018408	Y'know, as long as I've been working on this place, and I still really don't have any idea how it got started!
FO300018409	What do you know about Rivet City's history?
FO300018410	Oh, I don't know about that. For all I know, it's had survivors on it since the war. I'm just thankful it's here!
FO300018411	Maybe if you ask Bannon. He's been simply wonderful on the council, so I'm sure he'd be glad to help with your question.
FO300018412	I'm researching Rivet City's history. Can you tell me about it?
FO300018413	Oh, I don't know about that. For all I know, it's had survivors on it since the war. I'm just thankful it's here!
FO300018414	I'm researching Rivet City's history. Can you tell me about it?
FO300018415	If it hasn't got to do with the science quarters, I'm probably not the one to ask. And Doctor Li's so busy, you really shouldn't disturb her work.
FO300018416	Know anything about Rivet City's history?
FO300018417	If it hasn't got to do with the science quarters, I'm probably not the one to ask. I hardly ever get out, now that Doctor Li's gone.
FO300018418	Know anything about Rivet City's history?
FO300018419	Oh, I'd like to help, I really would. But I don't know the first thing about this place's history.
FO300018420	Don't let my age fool you; I may have been around for a while, but I didn't spend all that time here!
FO300018421	Sorry, but I don't really know much about it. More worried about what's going wrong with the here and now, see?
FO300018422	Can you tell me about Rivet City's history?
FO300018423	Huh? History? What history? No history here, man.
FO300018424	I'm trying to find out Rivet City's history. Can you help?
FO300018425	Huh? History? What history? No history here, girl.
FO300018426	I'm trying to find out Rivet City's history. Can you help?
FO300018427	Well, I don't really know, to tell the truth. How does any city get started, really?
FO300018428	But I've heard Bannon talk about how he was responsible for its success, so I'd ask him about it.
FO300018429	What can you tell me about Rivet City's history?
FO300018430	Well, I don't really know, to tell the truth. How does any city get started, really?
FO300018431	What can you tell me about Rivet City's history?
FO300018432	I know a lot of places opened up when they got the hydroponics bay working, but that's hardly the start of it all, is it?
FO300018433	Actually, Vera Weatherly might know more. She's always here and talking with folks, so if anyone's picked up a story or two, it'd be her.
FO300018434	Do you know anything about Rivet City's history?
FO300018435	I hardly even get out of the galley, so I really can't say I know much, there.
FO300018436	I know a lot of places opened up when they got the hydroponics bay working, but that's hardly the start of it all, is it?
FO300018437	Do you know anything about Rivet City's history?
FO300018438	I heard the place was settled by mercenaries who used to scavenge DC. But I don't really know.
FO300018439	Dude, I only just got here, myself. Ain't nothing I could tell you.
FO300018440	Can I ask you about Rivet City's history?
FO300018441	Lady, I only just got here, myself. Ain't nothing I could tell you.
FO300018442	Can I ask you about Rivet City's history?
FO300018443	Would you mind me asking about Rivet City's history?
FO300018444	Why bother? There's never anything good in the past.
FO300018445	Just leave that sort of thing alone.
FO300018446	Just leave me alone.
FO300018447	I can give you a history of every fight in this place, but a history of the city? I got nothing.
FO300018448	Belle's probably heard stories, but be careful asking about them. People like their privacy, y'know? Otherwise, you might end up as history.
FO300018449	Do you know about Rivet City's history?
FO300018450	I can give you a history of every fight in this place, but a history of the city? I got nothing.
FO300018451	Do you know about Rivet City's history?
FO300018452	Can't help you with the history, honey.
FO300018453	No. No, you can't.
FO300018454	Can I ask you about Rivet City's history?
FO300018455	I can't see how important it is compared to the Capital's history, but maybe Bannon might know something. He's in the governing council, after all.
FO300018456	Do you know the history of Rivet City?
FO300018457	Frankly, it sounds just you're thinking too small, when you could ask about the much more important history of the capital!
FO300018458	Do you know the history of Rivet City?
FO300018459	Oh, it's not the past of the city that I dwell upon, but the future of its inhabitants.
FO300018460	But if you're interested, I believe Miss Weatherly or Mr Bannon would be glad to speak with you on the subject.
FO300018461	What do you know about Rivet City's history?
FO300018462	Oh, it's not the past of the city that I dwell upon, but the future of its inhabitants.
FO300018463	But if you're interested, I believe Mr Bannon would be glad to speak with you on the subject.
FO300018464	What do you know about Rivet City's history?
FO300018465	I heard tell the place used to be run by Raiders, until someone cleared the whole place out. But I don't really know for sure.
FO300018466	Looks to me like a giant boat ran aground and a bunch of savages moved in. History lesson over.
FO300018467	Do you know the history behind Rivet City?
FO300018468	No, thank you. Please leave Mr Zimmer and myself alone.
FO300018469	Know anything about the history of Rivet City?
FO300018470	No, thank you. Please leave me alone.
FO300018471	Know anything about the history of Rivet City?
FO300018472	Do I look like someone who cares?
FO300018473	Have you heard anything about the history of Rivet City?
FO300018474	But why do you waste your talents on this garbage?
FO300018475	Junk can be turned into all sorts of useful things. And sometimes, even something wonderful.
FO300018476	And junk's all we've got left after the world blew up. Everyone's trying to fix it like it was, but nobody's trying to make something that's better.
FO300018477	I don't understand. Crazy experiments are what keep you going?
FO300018478	But if you're clever, you can still use the pieces to make other useful things. Maybe even something wonderful, like a mosaic.
FO300018479	Well, the world broke just like glass. And everyone's trying to put it back together like it was, but it'll never come together the same way.
FO300018480	Why are you always working on such weird ideas?
FO300018481	Well, look around at the world we live in. It may be okay to you, but I've read about what it used to be like, and this wasn't it.
FO300018482	So we all need something that keeps us going, despite all the terrible things around us. For me, it's things like this book.
FO300018483	I don't need your armor. I've gotten this far without it.
FO300018484	Okay, it's your call. I'm just trying to protect you.
FO300018485	If you think you can handle this, we need to get moving.
FO300018486	I'll take the Recon Armor.
FO300018487	All right, here you go. I hope it fits.
FO300018488	So you think you can handle this?
FO300018489	I'll take the Power Armor.
FO300018490	Sure thing. Hopefully it'll give you a bit of an extra edge.
FO300018491	Okay, so do you think you can hold it together for this?
FO300018492	MQ11SarahCombatLines
FO300018493	Get some suppressing fire over there, now!
FO300018494	Have you ever considered getting back out there?
FO300018495	No offense, kid, but you're not exactly the type I'm used to runnin' with.
FO300018496	Nah, it ain't so bad here. I got some good memories, but that's all I got. No sense in ruining the good ones, you know?
FO300018497	Are you interested in joining up with me?
FO300018498	Come back when you're alone and maybe we can work something out.
FO300018499	Are you interested in joining up with me?
FO300018500	Yeah, I am. But I'm gonna need 1,000 caps for supplies before I head out with you.
FO300018501	Are you interested in joining up with me?
FO300018502	What? Back out where?
FO300018503	Oh yeah? Have you heard of a crew that'll take me?
FO300018504	This again. Okay, I'll play along. Back out where?
FO300018505	Out there in the Wastes, man. You must be bored to tears in this town.
FO300018506	You know what? Forget I said anything.
FO300018507	Why the fuck would you start saying it if you weren't going to finish. Back out where? What are you talking about?
FO300018508	I was talking about the Wastes. You must be going crazy in this place.
FO300018509	But c'mon, I'm a washed up old raider. What crew is gonna take me on? These kids don't know nothin' about respect.
FO300018510	No, really. Never mind.
FO300018511	I see how it is. You'd best think twice before fucking with me again.
FO300018512	MS16ButchWhyHelp
FO300018513	Because you've always been a goody two-shoes, so when I need help, it's what you're gonna do, right?
FO300018514	You're going to help Amata anyway, right? Just make it so we can leave the Vault, and I'll leave and never bother you again.
FO300018515	Why should I help you, Butch?
FO300018516	Look, I know I've been kind of a jerk. But I don't deserve to be stuck down here forever. Not when I could have a real life up there like you.
FO300018517	I mean, you're kind of a jerk sometimes, and you make it work up there. So why not me?
FO300018518	Just make it so we can leave the Vault, and I can go out there for my new life. Heck, maybe we could form a gang, huh?
FO300018519	Why should I help you, Butch?
FO300018520	You left this place, so I bet you hate it as much as I do. So you can imagine how crappy it'd be to be stuck down here forever, yeah?
FO300018521	Are you gonna force all of us to live like that, now that we've learned we could actually leave and try for something new?
FO300018522	Just make it so we can get out of this vault, and I'll be gone, man. Then you don't ever need to see me again, okay?
FO300018523	Why should I help you, Butch?
FO300018524	I heard old Stanley complaining a lot of the stuff down in the reactor got fried pretty bad.
FO300018525	What happened that night?
FO300018526	The real problems came after you two left. The injured had nobody to turn to, since our doctor had run off, and his assistant had died.
FO300018527	Now we've got to rely on that old Mr. Handy for most of our medical needs. And he hasn't exactly got the best bedside manner.
FO300018528	Ever had an examination from someone with cold, metal pincers? You don't want to!
FO300018529	What happened that night?
FO300018530	Yeah, well get us out of here, and we'll see, won't we?
FO300018531	I bet you're Mole Rat chow before you make it one day out there.
FO300018532	Well, they ain't seen nothing like me, yet. Butch is gonna take that Wasteland by storm!
FO300018533	Yeah, but I'm thinking it'll be a new gang. We ain't going to just be in tunnels, you know!
FO300018534	Besides, there's gonna be a lot more people who want to join. Competition's gonna be tough!
FO300018535	Hey, I'm already in the Tunnel Snakes. You gave me the jacket and everything!
FO300018536	'Cause maybe you've got an ounce of sense. Everyone's gonna want to join, once they know Butch is in town!
FO300018537	What makes you think I'd want to join?
FO300018538	I'll start a gang, of course! Why, it'll be the toughest, coolest, badass-est gang the Wasteland's ever seen!
FO300018539	Hey, play your cards right, maybe I'll even let you join it, huh?
FO300018540	What do you think you're going to do outside, Butch?
FO300018541	Your "government" is a joke, Autumn.
FO300018542	Give it up, Autumn. You've lost.
FO300018543	I beg to differ. The Enclave is at the height of its power.
FO300018544	Once this facility is operational, the masses will flock to the Enclave for fresh water, protection, and a plan for the future.
FO300018545	Look, I don't want to fight you.
FO300018546	You don't have to. Just stand there. It'll be over quicker, and might even be less painful for you.
FO300018547	I'm going to enjoy killing you.
FO300018548	You're in over your head, I'm afraid.
FO300018549	But this is the path you choose for yourself. Tell your father I said hello.
FO300018550	Actually, I don't know where they are. But thanks for the caps.
FO300018551	You don't seem to realize who you're dealing with.
FO300018552	They're just around the corner. You can't miss them.
FO300018553	You'd better not be screwin' with me.
FO300018554	Yeah, they're hiding right around the corner.
FO300018555	Thanks, friend. You might stop by Paradise Falls if you like this kind of work.
FO300018556	Maybe I have. What's it worth to you?
FO300018557	Okay, I'll bite. Here's 50 caps. Now where are those damn runners?
FO300018558	No, I haven't seen any slaves around here.
FO300018559	Yeah, okay, sure. If you see them, feel free to shoot them for me. Runners aren't worth the trouble of bringing them in.
FO300018560	Would you mind playing the violin for me?
FO300018561	I would be delighted.
FO300018562	Oh! Absolutely. It's the least I can do for all your efforts.
FO300018563	I would love to play for you.
FO300018564	How are you feeling, Agatha?
FO300018565	Much better lately, thanks for asking.
FO300018566	With the return of the Soil Stradivarius, everything has changed. It's like a long-lost family member has come home.
FO300018567	Actually, I'm feeling quite sad right now. I have all this beautiful music in my head and only a terrible homemade violin to play it on.
FO300018568	Blast this old woman's body I'm stuck in! I know where I could get my hands on a better one, but it's too far and too dangerous for the likes of me.
FO300018569	It's such a pity to imagine what's happened to the Soil Stradivarius violin after all this time resting in Vault 92.
FO300018570	Uh, I think I saw them about two miles south of here.
FO300018571	Take me for an easy mark, eh? Bad move.
FO300018572	Why don't you just kill yourself?
FO300018573	Now how exactly am I supposed to do that? I can barely move anymore.
FO300018574	Thanks to Bob, I'm obviously not going to be doing anything for a very long time.
FO300018575	If I kill you, every Treeminder will come after me.
FO300018576	Oh no, don't worry about them. When you decide to go down there, I'll have a little chat with Birch and the rest of the gang.
FO300018577	They usually don't understand a word I say, but I'll make them come around.
FO300018578	How would I be able to kill you? You're a tree.
FO300018579	It's hard to tell where everything is, but it's always that way with one's insides, isn't it?
FO300018580	Anyway, I believe Bob's carried some of my organs into his root system. I want you to go underground and destroy my heart.
FO300018581	Sure. Where do you want the bullet, head or gut?
FO300018582	I wish it was that simple. No, no. There's only one way you're going to be able to do this for me.
FO300018583	Kill you? You can't be serious!
FO300018584	Completely serious. You'd be doing me a favor.
FO300018585	The only friends I've got are Bob and those weirdos out there who think I'm a god.
FO300018586	You want me to murder you?
FO300018587	Oh no, no, no. It wouldn't be murder. You'd be doing me a favor.
FO300018588	The only friends I've got are Bob and those weirdos out there who think I'm a god.
FO300018589	Look, let's cut the bullshit and get to the matter at hand.
FO300018590	I had you brought in here to ask a very simple favor.
FO300018591	Would you please kill me?
FO300018592	So, the Treeminders said you needed my help?
FO300018593	I had you brought in here to ask a very simple favor.
FO300018594	Would you please kill me?
FO300018595	Well, hopefully your troubles will be over. I'm here to help.
FO300018596	I had you brought in here to ask a very simple favor.
FO300018597	Would you please kill me?
FO300018598	A genetic mutation of that magnitude could only be caused by F.E.V.
FO300018599	Whoa-ho! Check out the brain on this guy!
FO300018600	We were pretty deep inside and we found some weird vats of this nasty green goo. Right when we were about to leave, I think we were attacked.
FO300018601	Last thing I remember before blacking out was something knocking my friend into the stuff.
FO300018602	I still don't understand what the hell you're talking about.
FO300018603	Yes, perhaps it doesn't even matter anyway. Forget I mentioned it.
FO300018604	How on Earth did that happen?
FO300018605	We were pretty deep inside and we found some weird vats of this nasty green goo. Right when we were about to leave, I think we were attacked.
FO300018606	Last thing I remember before blacking out was something knocking my friend into the stuff.
FO300018607	How did a tree end up growing out of your head?
FO300018608	We were pretty deep inside and we found some weird vats of this nasty green goo. Right when we were about to leave, I think we were attacked.
FO300018609	Last thing I remember before blacking out was something knocking my friend into the stuff.
FO300018610	What in the hell are you talking about?
FO300018611	Not very bright, are you?
FO300018612	Bob, that's the tree, used to ride around on top of my head, sunk his roots right in there, ya know?
FO300018613	Well, eventually he got bigger than me, and then I pretty much ended up inside.
FO300018614	I'm beginning to suspect you weren't always this way.
FO300018615	Well, you're quite clever.
FO300018616	See, Bob used to ride around on top of my head, sunk his roots right in there, ya know?
FO300018617	Well, eventually he got bigger than me, and then I pretty much ended up inside.
FO300018618	Well, I suppose you could look at it that way. See, Bob used to ride around on top of my head, sunk his roots right in there, ya know?
FO300018619	Well, eventually he got bigger than me, and then I pretty much ended up inside.
FO300018620	You should come with me. I could use a hand.
FO300018621	No offense, kid, but you're not exactly the type I'm used to runnin' with.
FO300018622	Nah, it ain't so bad here. I got some good memories, but that's all I got. No sense in ruining the good ones, you know?
FO300018623	Come back when you're alone and maybe we can work something out.
FO300018624	Tell you what, drop 1,000 caps on me for supplies and I'm in.
FO300018625	You're right. That sounds terrible.
FO300018626	But c'mon, I'm a washed up old Raider. What crew is gonna take me on? These kids don't know nothin' about respect.
FO300018627	Why can't you do this research yourself?
FO300018628	Oh, I haven't got nearly the experience in the Wastes that you do. If I tried half of these things, I'd get my head blown off!
FO300018629	At least you look like you can really handle yourself out there. All I'm good at is coming up with the ideas and fiddling with junk for caravans.
FO300018630	Why can't you do this research yourself?
FO300018631	Why are you doing this? Why give your allegiance to a machine?
FO300018632	I am sworn to protect the Presidency. The chain of command must be upheld.
FO300018633	I wouldn't expect you to understand.
FO300018634	Raven Rock is gone. Eden checked out. You've got nothing left.
FO300018635	The American people are worth fighting for. The future must be secured. I won't let you stand in the way of that.
FO300018636	Eden betrayed you. You see this vial? He trusts me more than he trusts you.
FO300018637	That's not true. That plan was abandoned months ago. He would never go behind my back!
FO300018638	And your point?
FO300018639	You have anything for sale?
FO300018640	Whatever I managed to pick up out there. Some pistols, rifles, and assorted ammunition.
FO300018641	Well, I could use some firepower myself. What are you selling?
FO300018642	Alright, sure, why not? Plenty to go around, if you got the caps that is.
FO300018643	Stealth Boys? I could use some of those myself.
FO300018644	Alright, sure, why not? Plenty to go around, if you got the caps that is.
FO300018645	Robot parts? I could use some of those myself.
FO300018646	Alright, sure, why not? Plenty to go around, if you got the caps that is.
FO300018647	Mines? I could use some of those myself.
FO300018648	Mainly food and beverages. Plenty to go around, if you got the caps to pay for them that is.
FO300018649	I could use some supplies myself. What are you selling?
FO300018650	Sure. Have a look. I guess folks in Megaton won't be needing them anymore.
FO300018651	I have a few things. May as well sell them to you as cart them all the way back to Megaton.
FO300018652	Everything has its price. Take a look and make me an offer.
FO300018653	A few odds and ends.
FO300018654	If the price is right. Make me an offer.
FO300018655	Various things. You never know what might come in handy.
FO300018656	What are you selling?
FO300018657	You might be surprised at what you can use to keep a robot working.
FO300018658	What are you selling?
FO300018659	Have a look and see for yourself.
FO300018660	What are you selling?
FO300018661	Various things. You never know what might come in handy.
FO300018662	What are you selling?
FO300018663	You might be surprised at what you can use to keep a robot working.
FO300018664	What are you selling?
FO300018665	Have a look and see for yourself.
FO300018666	What are you selling?
FO300018667	Actually, never mind. I don't need your help.
FO300018668	Huhn. I see how it is. No use for a washed up old waster, huh? Well, kid, the offer's open any time you wanna take it.
FO300018669	Here you go. Let's get out of here.
FO300018670	Haha! This is gonna be great! Some good ol' fashioned violence!
FO300018671	Well what'd you get my hopes up for? I can't head out there without supplies, now can I?
FO300018672	Tell you what: the offer's open. Just come back when you've got the thousand.
FO300018673	Actually, I don't have 1,000 caps.
FO300018674	Thanks, Agatha. It's more than I expected.
FO300018675	You're welcome. Just keep it clean and repaired and it will never let you down.
FO300018676	Now, scoot. I have to get cracking on this music notation.
FO300018677	No, no, no. You keep it. You may need it!
FO300018678	Nonsense. I've never fired a gun before in my life and I'm not about to start any time soon.
FO300018679	You take this thing and use it to protect yourself while you're out there. I'll be just fine. Here.
FO300018680	Now, scoot. I have a lot of music to write.
FO300018681	It better be good. I busted my ass getting that paper.
FO300018682	Manners are not your strong suit, are they?
FO300018683	Here, take this pistol. It's all I have left. Use it to protect yourself, or shoot yourself in the foot for all I care.
FO300018684	Now if you don't mind, I need to get some things done. Goodbye.
FO300018685	Sure, I'll take whatever you can afford.
FO300018686	Well, like I told you before, I don't have wealth out here in the sticks, but I can certainly provide you something useful.
FO300018687	My husband left me something else besides the radio setup. I think you'll find it useful.
FO300018688	It's his old pistol. He tinkered with it some and used to practice with it all the time. Now I want you to have it.
FO300018689	No, no. Having you write it down is reward enough.
FO300018690	I'm speechless. Thank you.
FO300018691	You're welcome here any time. Consider my house as a safe haven if you're ever in the area.
FO300018692	Now, let me get writing. So much to do!
FO300018693	I suppose this one is a freebie too, eh?
FO300018694	I'm no richer now than I was before we met. All I can offer you is an old woman's thanks.
FO300018695	Let me get back with you on this.
FO300018696	Of course. There's no rush really, it was just an idea. Take your time.
FO300018697	If you come across the paper on your travels, good. If not, I don't blame you one bit.
FO300018698	Sure, I'll get the paper for you.
FO300018699	My word! You actually found some REAL music paper? I didn't even think it possible.
FO300018700	Yet here it is. You've really outdone yourself this time. I knew getting the Stradivarius was a challenge, but this is just incredible.
FO300018701	Hang on a minute. If you need paper, I already have it.
FO300018702	Well, thank you. You've done so much for me already, I just don't know what else to say.
FO300018703	If you get the paper, head back here in time. There's no rush.
FO300018704	Paper? Why not record it on a holotape?
FO300018705	Look around you. Do you see any fancy computers or high tech gizmos?
FO300018706	My husband and I were never into that kind of junk. The most hi-tech thing we have is the radio setup, and even that was old before the bombs fell.
FO300018707	Nope, I sure don't. I need the music paper to properly record the notes.
FO300018708	If I just wrote on anything, it may not look standard enough to teach everyone in the future to read from it properly.
FO300018709	You think you can bring some to me?
FO300018710	Then stop whining about it, and do it!
FO300018711	Well, darn it, I think I will!
FO300018712	I remember all the notations. All I need now is some music paper to write it on.
FO300018713	What do you need to get it done?
FO300018714	Well, I only need two things. My noggin and some music paper.
FO300018715	You aren't going to live forever, you know.
FO300018716	What a vulgar way to put it. However, you're right.
FO300018717	What if I was the last person on the planet that had those pieces of music committed to memory?
FO300018718	Imagine all those great works vanishing. It almost brings me to tears.
FO300018719	It doesn't matter. Everything gets lost with time.
FO300018720	You make a good point. I'm no spring chicken, so one day I'll be gone.
FO300018721	Oh my, what if I'm the last person on the planet to know these pieces of music? What if all the recordings have been destroyed?
FO300018722	To lose such beautiful music would be a shame.
FO300018723	You should write your music down, to keep it preserved for the future.
FO300018724	My word! You actually found some REAL music paper? I didn't even think it possible.
FO300018725	Yet here it is. You've really outdone yourself this time. I knew getting the Stradivarius was a challenge, but this is just incredible.
FO300018726	Guess what I have for you?
FO300018727	I'm afraid I don't. I'm surprised you didn't find any in Vault 92 knowing that it was a place where musicians used to live.
FO300018728	I would ask every merchant and just search the Wasteland. Perhaps one day you'll be in luck.
FO300018729	Do you have any clue where I can find the music paper?
FO300018730	Well, I suppose I could. They aren't my pieces of music by any stretch of the imagination though.
FO300018731	I took a little peek at the files in your computer. Tell me about the android.
FO300018732	You hacked my computer? You've got some skills. It's been a while since I've met someone smart enough to best me. So I'll let that slide.
FO300018733	I documented the whole thing. So I could rub it in the face of Dr. Li when I need to rankle her feathers. I hate that snooty bitch.
FO300018734	You know what? Screw this. You're going down.
FO300018735	Such arrogance!
FO300018736	If that's your wish, so be it. Take some small comfort in knowing you'll have little time to regret the decision.
FO300018737	This isn't the way to do it. More fighting will just make things worse.
FO300018738	And what would you have me do? Let you have everything I've worked to build? Let you destroy it all?
FO300018739	Just walk away. It's not too late.
FO300018740	I suppose it doesn't matter much now.
FO300018741	Very well. I shall leave you to your fate.
FO300018742	Smile!
FO300018743	What's on the menu?
FO300018744	You're in for a treat, the finest food in DC. Four stars.
FO300018745	Yep. Get it while it's lukewarm.
FO300018746	Just don't ask what it's made of. You humans seem to have weak stomachs.
FO300018747	I need a drink.
FO300018748	I got whatever you need.
FO300018749	Your misery, my wealth.
FO300018750	Sure, sure, what do you need?
FO300018751	Let ol' Uncle Ahzrukhal help you get rid of the pain.
FO300018752	A city full of Ghouls, huh?
FO300018753	That's right. And so long as you don't bother us, we won't bother you. Feel free to come and go, trade, sleep, whatever.
FO300018754	Just make sure that you leave whatever trouble is following you at the door, because we don't want it.
FO300018755	So, enjoy your stay, smoothskin.
FO300018756	The Brotherhood of Steel? What's your beef with them?
FO300018757	Bastards. They don't seem to be able to tell us apart from the Super Mutants. Or, maybe they just don't care. They see us and shoot on sight.
FO300018758	Yeah, he's in Megaton working for some jackass.
FO300018759	She'll be happy to hear it, even if he's not doing well.
FO300018760	Yeah, he's up in Megaton tending bar.
FO300018761	Megaton! Way up there? I always did wonder what happened to that boy. When he disappeared, I just figured it was the Super Mutants what got him.
FO300018762	Good to know that he's doin' okay. You should stop by and see his ma over at Carol's place. She'll be happy to hear some news about him.
FO300018763	Where am I?
FO300018764	You're in Underworld, smoothskin. It's the only safe place for we Ghouls in D.C. We're here, out of sight and out of mind.
FO300018765	The mutants leave us alone and the Slavers usually don't come this far into the city, so it's not bad.
FO300018766	Smoothskin? What does that mean?
FO300018767	Relax! I'm just kidding! But I had you going, didn't I?
FO300018768	Jesus Christ! What are you?
FO300018769	Oh, you're one of those Ghouls! Just like Gob!
FO300018770	Yep, I am. Remember: stop by Carol's and let Gob's mom know how he's doin'.
FO300018771	Oh, you're one of those Ghouls! Just like Gob!
FO300018772	Now tell me, how is it that you ended up down here in Ghoul central without knowing what a Ghoul is? Huh?
FO300018773	You know, never mind. I'm a Ghoul. Everyone down here: Ghouls. That's what we are. And before you ask "what's a Ghoul", lemme tell you.
FO300018774	You know, nevermind. I'm a Ghoul. Everyone down here: Ghouls. That's what we are. And before you ask "what's a Ghoul", lemme tell you.
FO300018775	Tell me more about this Dave guy.
FO300018776	That's right. As president, I am head of the Department of Tourist Rights, the Office of Immigrant Affairs, and the Bureau of Davelike Activities.
FO300018777	So, you're in charge here, Mister President?
FO300018778	That's President Dave to you, Wastelander. Call him by his full name, or we'll shoot you.
FO300018779	He takes care of all of us, even that selfish Rosie and her brats. My children will be a lot nicer than hers.
FO300018780	Dave is a good man. He looks after all the children and makes sure they have plenty to do. He's bought a lot of toys, not that he'd admit it.
FO300018781	He has our Shawna teach classes to the younger ones. She's over at the Museum of Dave to the west of the Republic.
FO300018782	Dave made me Second-Commander of the Army of Dave, and that means I get a gun. Don't make me have to use it.
FO300018783	President Dave is the savior of the Wasteland, bringing peace and order to the savages man has brought upon himself.
FO300018784	If you would like to learn more, please stop by the Museum of Dave's official tour at 2 PM.
FO300018785	He's my daddy! Whenever we play republic, I get to play as Dave!
FO300018786	Watch, watch! "I am sorry sir, but I am afraid that the Bureau of Davelike Activities has ordered your execution!"
FO300018787	Aren't I good? Huh?
FO300018788	He's my daddy. He and mommy number one fight sometimes, probably cause of mommy number two.
FO300018789	Daddy! President Daddy to you! <giggles>
FO300018790	Daddy? He's not so bad. Shawna says he's the most important man to ever walk the Wastes.
FO300018791	I don't know about that. The Wastes are awfully big.
FO300018792	Actually, I think I have all the info I need.
FO300018793	Alright then.
FO300018794	Anything else?
FO300018795	Glad to hear it.
FO300018796	Wait, who's this Dave guy, and why does he have his own Republic?
FO300018797	He's the president of the Republic of Dave, duh. You can ask over at the Museum of Dave if you don't believe me.
FO300018798	But you can't just wander around here, you need to go get permission from President Daddy first!
FO300018799	MS16Evacuate2B
FO300018800	Why? Why would they throw away their home, just to die outside in that miserable wasteland? Was I really so terrible an overseer?
FO300018801	I must have pushed them too hard, made the unknown seem too tempting. And now I've failed them. Their deaths will be my fault.
FO300018802	Please, help a few of them stay alive out there. And say goodbye to my daughter for me.
FO300018803	I'll stay with the Vault. It was my responsibility, and my failure.
FO300018804	One of the rebels did it to force everyone to leave. I tried to stop them. <Lie.>
FO300018805	But there's no time for that now, is there? Now our only chance is to survive outside on our own.
FO300018806	Maybe I can still find where some of them went. If we split up, it shouldn't be too hard. How big can the world be, anyway?
FO300018807	Thanks for trying to help us. Maybe we'll meet again out there.
FO300018808	Your father started this. He said no one would leave if they all died. <Lie>
FO300018809	But there's no time for that now, is there? Now our only chance is to survive outside on our own.
FO300018810	Maybe I can still find where some of them went. If we split up, it shouldn't be too hard. How big can the world be, anyway?
FO300018811	Thanks for trying to help us. Maybe we'll meet again out there.
FO300018812	The Overseer started this. He said no one would leave if they all died. <Lie>
FO300018813	Yeah, well, I can learn, can't I? If you can do it, it's gotta be pretty easy.
FO300018814	Maybe I can form a gang of my own. Maybe call it the Wasteland Radicals, or maybe the Rad Scorpions. Hey, wanna join?
FO300018815	I wouldn't be so excited. You have no idea what you're in for.
FO300018816	You're just going to leave us out there? You grew up with us as family, and you're going to leave us to die?
FO300018817	Fine! Leave, then! We don't need help from your type. Your father would be ashamed of you!
FO300018818	You're on your own. Out there in the Wasteland, it's every man for himself.
FO300018819	MS16Evacuate2A
FO300018820	How many of them do you think will survive out there? They're already in a panic, and running out to their death!
FO300018821	But you won't be joining them outside. I'll see to that myself!
FO300018822	Now you don't have the option to stay hidden in the Vault.
FO300018823	You've destroyed our home, just to prove a point? You're insane! You're worse than my father ever was!
FO300018824	I should never have helped you that night. I should have stayed with my father, and watched him kill you.
FO300018825	Now, you can stay down here and die, for all I care! If you ever talk to me again out there, I'll kill you.
FO300018826	I caused the evacuation. Now everyone has to leave the Vault.
FO300018827	Are you kidding me? It's a dream come true, man!  Butch the Hairdresser is no more, now I'm gonna be Butch the Wasteland Wanderer!
FO300018828	Maybe I can form a gang of my own. Maybe call it the Wasteland Radicals, or maybe the Rad Scorpions. Hey, wanna join?
FO300018829	You're taking this pretty well.
FO300018830	Oh, thank goodness. We'd never make it out there without you.
FO300018831	Just wait for me outside. I'll make sure you're all okay.
FO300018832	MS16Evacuate
FO300018833	What?! This is terrible! The vault will become uninhabitable!
FO300018834	How the hell can this be happening?
FO300018835	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
FO300018836	What?! This is terrible! The vault will become uninhabitable!
FO300018837	How the hell can this be happening?
FO300018838	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
FO300018839	Oh my god. The Vault's doomed. Everyone has to evacuate, and there's no way most of them will survive out there.
FO300018840	How did this happen?
FO300018841	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
FO300018842	What in the world? This is insane! We've got to get people to safety! But where can we go?
FO300018843	You're gonna make sure we're okay out there, right?
FO300018844	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
FO300018845	Really? Score!
FO300018846	Goodbye, hellhole! I'm off to a new life!
FO300018847	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
FO300018848	When are Angela and Diego getting married?
FO300018849	Oh! We forgot to invite you! You should come. Be at the church by 3 o'clock tomorrow.
FO300018850	When are you and Diego getting married?
FO300018851	The happy nuptials are at three tomorrow.
FO300018852	Young people. They make such a spectacle out of everything.
FO300018853	Who gives a crap. I've got better things to do a 3 o'clock tomorrow. Are you going to order a drink or not?
FO300018854	We haven't had a wedding in Rivet City in I don't know how long.
FO300018855	Be at the church at three tomorrow. That's when the ceremony starts.
FO300018856	At 3 o'clock tomorrow. Everyone in Rivet City is invited. I'm sure that includes you.
FO300018857	Tomorrow at three. You can come if you like. We've invited everyone in Rivet City.
FO300018858	When are you and Angela getting married?
FO300018859	You'll have to be at the church by 3 o'clock tomorrow. Don't worry. There will be plenty of seating.
FO300018860	Angela and Diego's wedding? I'd love to attend.
FO300018861	If you want a good seat, get to the church before three tomorrow.
FO300018862	They grow up so fast, don't they.
FO300018863	Angela and Diego. It's about time, don't you think?
FO300018864	I think I heard the ceremony is at 3 o'clock tomorrow. That's when I'm going to show up anyway.
FO300018865	Those brats are going to tie the knot tomorrow. I think it's at three.
FO300018866	Marriage is for saps, anyway. She'll be sorry. You watch.
FO300018867	At 3 o'clock, tomorrow.
FO300018868	I can hardly wait. I'm so happy for Angela.
FO300018869	We are gathered here today to witness the union of Diego and Angela in holy matrimony.
FO300018870	They have asked that their marriage be blessed by God and by Saint Monica.
FO300018871	They have also asked that it be witnessed by their friends and family.
FO300018872	I now pronounce you man and wife. What God has joined, let no man tear asunder.
FO300018873	I do.
FO300018874	I do.
FO300018875	Diego, will you take Angela for your lawful wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward...
FO300018876	for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish until death do you part?
FO300018877	Angela, will you take Diego, for your lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward,
FO300018878	for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish until death do you part?
FO300018879	CG02OverseerSpeech
FO300018880	Congratulations, young man! I don’t have to tell you how special this day is, do I?
FO300018881	Congratulations, young lady! I don’t have to tell you how special this day is, do I?
FO300018882	Down here in Vault 101, when you turn 10, well, you’re ready to take on your first official Vault responsibilities.
FO300018883	So here you are. As Overseer, I hereby present to you your very own Pip-Boy 3000! Get used to it.
FO300018884	You’ll be getting your first work assignment tomorrow. Ha ha ha ha ha!
FO300018885	Talk. To. Ahzrukhal.
FO300018886	I said: Talk to Ahzrukhal.
FO300018887	Don't make me say it again.
FO300018888	I don't care.
FO300018889	Talk. To. Ahzrukhal.
FO300018890	I said: Talk to Ahzrukhal.
FO300018891	Don't make me say it again.
FO300018892	I don't care.
FO300018893	Who's that guy in the corner?
FO300018894	That's Charon. Let's just say... well, he's a loyal employee. Don't mess with me, and he won't mess with you.
FO300018895	What can you tell me about Underworld?
FO300018896	It's the only place in the Capital Wasteland where my people can escape the misery of the world above.
FO300018897	I've been here since we founded the town. Before that, well, life out in the Wastes wasn't very pleasant for us.
FO300018898	It's a place for Ghouls. Here we're just people, not monsters.
FO300018899	There are too many places where a Ghoul can't get a fair shake.
FO300018900	It's a place for Ghouls, not humans.
FO300018901	We don't especially like humans.
FO300018902	So we stay down here, out of sight and out of trouble. We get a few smoothskins every so often, but most of us don't trust 'em.
FO300018903	You're not gonna give us more reasons not to be trusting, are you?
FO300018904	Why do you really want to write this guide?
FO300018905	Besides, it's bound to work out better than some of my other projects. I mean, with you helping, and all, how could it go wrong?
FO300018906	Ugh. How can you be walking around like this?
FO300018907	I hope you brought me something better than last year.
FO300018908	Well now! Young people were more polite back in my day. Respected their elders. Of course, we had a real Overseer back then. Worthy of respect.
FO300018909	Oh my, there I go again with my old lady talk and you still waiting patiently for your present.
FO300018910	I suppose you could have asked more politely, but it is still your birthday, so here you go: a nice sweetroll I baked just for you.
FO300018911	Oh, you didn't have to bring me a present, Mrs. Palmer.
FO300018912	Fiddlesticks! What 10-year-old doesn't like presents?
FO300018913	I was 10 once, believe it or not! My goodness, the Vault was practically crowded back then.
FO300018914	Yes, ma'am.
FO300018915	Such a nice polite young man you are! Don't ever lose your gift of speaking your mind so directly. We could use more of that down here.
FO300018916	Such a nice polite young lady you are! Don't ever lose your gift of speaking your mind so directly. We could use more of that down here.
FO300018917	CG02PaulHannonSpeech
FO300018918	Who do you mean, dork-face here? Happy birthday, dork-face! Ha ha ha!
FO300018919	Little baby went crying to Officer Gomez! Boo hoo!
FO300018920	Oh man, you already ate the whole thing? I wanted a bite of that.
FO300018921	Yeah, we don't want your cooties, right Butch?
FO300018922	Yeah, we don't need any more dorks around, right Butch?
FO300018923	I think you made her cry, Butch! Ha ha ha. Little baby gonna cry?
FO300018924	I think you made him cry, Butch! Ha ha ha. Little baby gonna cry?
FO300018925	Yeah, go play with your girlfriend. Ha ha ha.
FO300018926	Yeah, why don't you go play with your dolls and leave us alone.
FO300018927	Ha ha ha! You told him, Butch!
FO300018928	Ha ha ha! You told her, Butch!
FO300018929	Yeah, Paul, why don't you introduce us to your new best friend?
FO300018930	Yeah, Paul, why don't you introduce us to your new girlfriend?
FO300018931	You mean because we've already got one? Dork.
FO300018932	DaveFeudTalk
FO300018933	Don't talk to me that way.
FO300018934	I told you not to talk to me like that.
FO300018935	Or else what?  Yeah, thought so.
FO300018936	Shut up.
FO300018937	DaveElectionTalk
FO300018938	I can't believe it's only a couple of days away.
FO300018939	Glad to hear that.
FO300018940	Crazy how it sneaks up on you, y'know?
FO300018941	That's none of your business.
FO300018942	Um, yeah.
FO300018943	Was I supposed to do it?  I didn't hear Dave saying we had to!
FO300018944	Yeah, but it'd be better if I could vote.
FO300018945	Ugh why can't I just vote now?
FO300018946	Santa Claus.
FO300018947	Um, I guess so.
FO300018948	You're too young to take Dave's place, anyway.
FO300018949	Too young? Too young? I am so sick of everyone around here pulling that "You're too young" crap with me.
FO300018950	I'm tired of it. I'm old enough to take Dave's place. I'll win that election and show everybody.
FO300018951	I think you should go for it.
FO300018952	Yeah? Well it just so happens that I like being number two around here. So I think I'll just stay right where I am.
FO300018953	I don't think you should be in charge of anything.
FO300018954	It's not a betrayal.  This is a free, um, nation... right?
FO300018955	Yeah, and like Dave says, freedom is the most free freedom that we have!
FO300018956	Is it because you're too stupid to be President?
FO300018957	It could be pretty tough, I guess.
FO300018958	Hmm, maybe you're right.  More trouble than it's worth.
FO300018959	Have you considered running for the presidency?
FO300018960	I can't be the president, I'm just a kid!
FO300018961	I'm too young!  I can't even vote yet.
FO300018962	I don't think anybody is even allowed to run against Dave.
FO300018963	Absolutely not. In fact, I'd vote for Dave twice if I could.
FO300018964	No way!  You'd have to be crazy to run against him.
FO300018965	Keep your voice down! I'm not really comfortable talking about it out here.
FO300018966	Believe it or not, I used to lead a group bigger than this one on an old caravan route.
FO300018967	But what am I talking about?  Running against Dave would be like betraying him.
FO300018968	I don't know. Like I said, I don't want to betray Dave.
FO300018969	I really think you should run for the presidency.
FO300018970	Man, I'd love to be the president.  Everybody would have to listen to me or I could just exile them to the Wasteland.
FO300018971	And the first thing I'd do is make myself the permanent leader so they couldn't vote me out in some other election.
FO300018972	But there's no need for me to run.  One year Dave is just going to make me the leader, just like my Grandpa Tom did for him.
FO300018973	Look, I already told you, one day Dave is just going to make me President.
FO300018974	I really think you should run for the presidency.
FO300018975	If you'll excuse me a moment, I'll be right back.
FO300018976	Don't waste my time. I've got important things to do around here.
FO300018977	Good riddance.
FO300018978	I'll just get going, then.
FO300018979	I've got to go.
FO300018980	You've wasted enough presidential time. Be gone.
FO300018981	Yes, you do.
FO300018982	Yeah, and I have to get back to work.
FO300018983	I'd like to throw my hat into the ring and run for the presidency.
FO300018984	I'm sorry, but the president must be a citizen of the Republic to run for office.  So you do not qualify.
FO300018985	Did you ask Dave if that's okay?
FO300018986	Um, did Dave say you could do that?
FO300018987	Who's running in the election?
FO300018988	Nobody except me. Why would the people need anyone else but Dave? I give them all that they ask for.
FO300018989	Let the people make their choice. I am confident that they will recognize me as their true and proper leader.
FO300018990	Looks like you might have an opponent in the race, Mister President.
FO300018991	So I've heard. She couldn't possibly think that she'd be better than Dave.
FO300018992	You know, Rosie is running for president now.
FO300018993	Wow, really?  I've always said that she'd make a great leader, and we've never had a woman lead us before...
FO300018994	You know, Rosie is running for president now.
FO300018995	You know, Bob is running for president now.
FO300018996	Wow, this is the first time we've had so many choices!
FO300018997	Have you heard that both Bob and Rosie are running in the election?
FO300018998	Poor girl doesn't stand much of a chance, does she?
FO300018999	You know, Rosie is running for president now.
FO300019000	You know, Bob is running for president.
FO300019001	You know, Bob is running for president now.
FO300019002	Wow, what's going on in this town?
FO300019003	You know, Bob and Rosie are running for president now.
FO300019004	Only Dave. He's the only person who ever runs.
FO300019005	Your father was a monarch? You mean like the butterfly?
FO300019006	How much radiation have you been exposed to? Not the butterfly, you moron. I meant the kind of leader that holds his office for life.
FO300019007	My father inherited his political power from birth and renamed this great nation the Kingdom of Tom.
FO300019008	Although I also inherited my political power from my father when I took over I formed a Republic so the people may elect their leader.
FO300019009	So, your father was a monarch and you're a president? How does that work?
FO300019010	My father inherited his political power from birth and renamed this great nation the Kingdom of Tom.
FO300019011	Although I also inherited my political power from my father when I took over I formed a Republic so the people may elect their leader.
FO300019012	Yes, absolutely.
FO300019013	Well then, there you go.  An election is what separates a president like myself from a monarch like my father.
FO300019014	I really wouldn't know. I just got here.
FO300019015	Ah, a seeker of knowledge, then? Well, trust me, an election is what separates a president like myself from a monarch like my father.
FO300019016	I'd say it looks more like a dictatorship.
FO300019017	Dictatorship? You insult me. Obviously the Wasteland radiation has taken away your capacity to reason.
FO300019018	You do that. Personal note: remind the guards to fire on sight.
FO300019019	No, of course not!
FO300019020	Ah-ha! Just what I'd expect a spy to say! Look, I don't know how you got in here, spy, but there will be consequences for your actions.
FO300019021	It is unacceptable for you to enter the Capitol Building without an invitation!
FO300019022	Assassin?  And you really thought you could succeed against the Army of Dave?
FO300019023	How the hell did you make that guy's head explode?
FO300019024	He did it. Dumb shit should've known the collar would blow. Now somebody's gotta clean up this mess.
FO300019025	Lucky break there. He almost got away.
FO300019026	Ain't none of 'em getting nowhere. Not with them collars on. Asshole should've known better.
FO300019027	Nothing. Nothing at all.
FO300019028	Goddamn right, nothing. Now get outta my way.
FO300019029	MQ07BreakoutSceneConv
FO300019030	Thought you'd get out of here, did you? You little shit. Get back inside, now.
FO300019031	You're fuckin' dead, you hear me? Dead!
FO300019032	You! Get back here now!
FO300019033	Run Sammy, run! We can make it!
FO300019034	No. It's a terrible idea. Don't even try.
FO300019035	But! But! But!
FO300019036	Look, if you ever stop by the caravans around here, I could probably get you a deal. I guess that's like helping humanity.
FO300019037	Yes, I really do.
FO300019038	Now, let's get this book finished!
FO300019039	It will just get us hurt. You don't want to hurt anyone, do you?
FO300019040	You're right. I can't go on with this book. What if the advice is bad and people get hurt because of it? I deserve to work on the caravans.
FO300019041	You don't have the experience for a book like this. You'll be a laughingstock.
FO300019042	But that's why I'm getting your help! I know my flaws, and with your help, we can make something great for the world!
FO300019043	Okay, I can tell how much it means to you. Let's get this book finished.
FO300019044	Really? You really mean that? You think my book really could help humanity?
FO300019045	But why try with this book, when you could be helping out in real ways here?
FO300019046	What, helping the trade caravans with idiotic chores? Repairing carts and fixing up sick Brahmin?
FO300019047	There's got to be something more worthwhile that I can do to help humanity!
FO300019048	I don't know. Human nature doesn't change like that.
FO300019049	Maybe. I've certainly heard people say that. But isn't it also human nature to try to do better than we always have?
FO300019050	Please, I've got to at least try to make the world better. And I can't do it on my own. I need your help.
FO300019051	So you're trying to make the world better than it was?
FO300019052	Hey, it sounds crazy when you say it that way, but that's what I'm aiming for, yeah.
FO300019053	The Wasteland Survival Guide isn't much towards that lofty goal, but it's an important one.
FO300019054	And that's why I need your help. I don't think I can do it alone.
FO300019055	Seriously, don't waste time with this book. Stick to helping the caravans.
FO300019056	I guess you're right. It was a silly idea. I'll just stick to doing what's important.
FO300019057	Hey, if you're ever around again, stop by. I'll see if I can get you a deal on repairs, I guess.
FO300019058	Seriously, don't waste time with this book. Stick to helping the caravans.
FO300019059	I don't know. Those caravans help a lot of people.
FO300019060	Well, I guess they do bring important supplies here and there. But still, I can help out so much more than the boring old stuff they do.
FO300019061	Writing this book will make a huge difference, trust me!
FO300019062	Well, I'm proud to be a part of it. You can count on me!
FO300019063	That's the spirit, trusty research assistant!
FO300019064	Moira, please don't write the book. It will just turn out badly.
FO300019065	I suppose you're right. I wouldn't want anyone else to get hurt because of my foolish ideas. I'll just stick to helping the caravans.
FO300019066	Hey, if you're ever around again, stop by. I'll see if I can get you a deal on repairs, I guess.
FO300019067	This really isn't a good idea. Please don't write it. It'll just turn out badly.
FO300019068	Okay, but it could be bad if the book's misleading. People could get hurt.
FO300019069	Oh, I hadn't really thought about it like that. I don't want anyone to get hurt. That's the last thing the guide should do!
FO300019070	Well, we're just going to have to make sure it's accurate and useful and great, then! You and me! Together, we can research and write a masterpiece!
FO300019071	I think you're right. Now, let's get back to work on this book!
FO300019072	You got it, super research assistant! Hey, I should get you a costume or something!
FO300019073	What do you mean about your other projects? Have there been problems?
FO300019074	I mean, how could I have predicted the Centaur would think my assistant smelled tasty?
FO300019075	But nothing bad like that could happen with this book. It's a great plan, and it'll make up for everything else!
FO300019076	Well, it's a big undertaking, and we've got to make sure we do it right.
FO300019077	It sounds like you don't know what you're doing.
FO300019078	I know exactly what I'm doing. I'm trying to help mankind survive and rebuild! It's important, and I need your help.
FO300019079	It's a hell of a lot better than wasting my talents with the caravans, repairing cart axles and coming up with new ways to shovel brahmin crap!
FO300019080	It's really good of you to try to help people like this.
FO300019081	I know, right? I figured, instead of just helping out the caravans with odd junk, why not put my brilliant mind to work for everyone?
FO300019082	And between my mind and your experience, this guide'll save a dozen times more lives than those greedy merchants will.
FO300019083	Nobody talks to me that way.
FO300019084	The President of the Republic does. Now get out of my sight.
FO300019085	What am I supposed to do?
FO300019086	What am I supposed to do?
FO300019087	Go see the guard at the front gate and schedule an appointment or something like everybody else does.
FO300019088	You can have it. I don't even like sweetrolls.
FO300019089	Yeah, right. Thanks, loser. Oh, and happy birthday, ha ha ha ha!
FO300019090	I threw it away. But you're welcome to eat it off the floor if you want.
FO300019091	You think you're funny? We'll see how funny you are later when I'm pounding on your face. Come on, Paul, this loser ain't worth our time.
FO300019092	You do look hungry. What, your mom drank up all the ration coupons again?
FO300019093	Don't you talk about my mom, you little punk!
FO300019094	Go soak your head, Butch. I'm not giving you my sweetroll.
FO300019095	Oh yeah? We'll see about that.
FO300019096	How about we share it? Half for me, half for you. That's fair, right?
FO300019097	Now are you going to give me that sweetroll, or am I going to give you a knuckle sandwich?
FO300019098	Sure, Butch. <Spit on the sweetroll and give it to him.>
FO300019099	Gah! I don't want your nerd-cooties! You're going to be sorry you did that. We'll see how tough you are later when the grownups aren't around.
FO300019100	UnderworldTalkResponseShort2
FO300019101	She's dead, you damn fool robot. Thanks for reminding me.
FO300019102	Yes, yes, everything is fine.
FO300019103	Oh, it's great. Everything is perfect. Greta takes good care of us.
FO300019104	UnderworldTalkHelloResponseShort
FO300019105	No time to talk now, Winthrop. Too busy.
FO300019106	Hello, Winthrop. Have a seat, I'll be with you in a minute.
FO300019107	Welcome! Sit. Drink. Pay.
FO300019108	Get yourself another drink, you look entirely too sober.
FO300019109	My friend, you are not drinking nearly enough.
FO300019110	If you're sober enough to say hello, you're far too sober.
FO300019111	Less talking, more drinking.
FO300019112	You look like someone who needs another drink.
FO300019113	And a hello to you.
FO300019114	And a hello to you, sir.
FO300019115	And a hello to you, ma'am.
FO300019116	Hey, Greta. How's my girl?
FO300019117	Hello, Greta. You always manage to make me feel a little better.
FO300019118	If you need anything, just ask Greta.
FO300019119	Hello. How is everything?
FO300019120	Hi there, enjoying yourself?
FO300019121	I hope that everything is staying where it should be, Patchwork.
FO300019122	Stop by the clinic, Patchwork. Greta found one of your fingers over in Carol's Place.
FO300019123	Hello, hello.
FO300019124	No time to talk now, stop by the clinic.
FO300019125	Come by the clinic some time, you're overdue for a sewing.
FO300019126	Hey, hon. I haven't seen you in here in a while.
FO300019127	Long time, no see.
FO300019128	Do you ever leave here?
FO300019129	Yes, yes, hello. We covered that already.
FO300019130	Yeah, hello. Whatever.
FO300019131	Can't you see that I'm busy? Leave me alone.
FO300019132	I'd be much better off if you people would just leave me alone.
FO300019133	Why, aren't we just the friendliest bunch of walking corpses that you ever did see?
FO300019134	Oh, please.
FO300019135	Yeah, I'm okay, Winthrop.
FO300019136	I'm doin' alright, Winthrop. Just having a rough day, you know?
FO300019137	Yep. Keepin' my bits to myself for the time bein'.
FO300019138	Haven't lost anything permanently. Not yet.
FO300019139	Hey, hello! I just got back! Good to see you!
FO300019140	Remind me to sit you down and tell you about some of the things that I've seen.
FO300019141	I'm back! And you wouldn't believe some of the things that happened to me this time. But I can't talk now. Maybe later?
FO300019142	Hey there, long time, no see! I've got some good stories to tell you later!
FO300019143	Hello!
FO300019144	Hey, good to see you! Are you here to buy something?
FO300019145	Hey there, you should check out the new stuff I have at the store.
FO300019146	No time, no time. Everything around here is always busted. Can't ever get a break.
FO300019147	Nope. Not now. Too busy.
FO300019148	Hooo, sorry. No time to talk. The air circulation system is busted again.
FO300019149	I can't talk right now, the work never ends around here.
FO300019150	Hey, you.
FO300019151	UnderworldTalkGhoulBarSmellResponse
FO300019152	No, not really.
FO300019153	I haven't been able to smell anything for about thirty years now.
FO300019154	Are you joking? I lost my sense of smell before you even crinkled up.
FO300019155	Not, not really.
FO300019156	What are you talking about?
FO300019157	Not since the last time you asked.
FO300019158	Yeah, that's really weird. Oh well, it's gone now.
FO300019159	UnderworldTalkGhoulCarolsChatterResponse
FO300019160	Yeah, now that you mention it. I wonder what's going on...
FO300019161	Haven't noticed, don't care.
FO300019162	I don't really pay attention. I only come here because I can't stand the Ninth Circle. That place is just nasty. Even I think so.
FO300019163	Actually, I haven't noticed. At all.
FO300019164	UnderworldTalkGhoulBarDrinkResponse
FO300019165	Are you kidding? I wouldn't feed that shit to the dog.
FO300019166	I'd rather drink malted rat piss.
FO300019167	It's not half bad, I guess.
FO300019168	I don't even know what good drinks taste like anymore.
FO300019169	I've forgotten the taste of good liquor.
FO300019170	UnderworldTalkGhoulBarChatterResponse
FO300019171	Dude. Harshing the buzz. Minus five points.
FO300019172	We'd probably all be better off if the Brotherhood came through here and "purged" us.
FO300019173	Go away, I'm trying to enjoy myself here.
FO300019174	Well, aren't you a ray of sunshine?
FO300019175	UnderworldTalk4
FO300019176	Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Ahzrukhal! Thank you so much!
FO300019177	UnderworldTalk3
FO300019178	Ah, yes! Of course, of course, my friend. See me later tonight. We'll make sure that you have all the pick-me-ups that you need.
FO300019179	Shhh, say no more. See me later, I'll make sure that you want for nothing.
FO300019180	No need to be shy, my friend. I'll make sure that you have everything that you ever need, so long as you have the caps to pay for it, that is.
FO300019181	UnderworldTalk2
FO300019182	I'm all out of the stuff you sold me yesterday. I need more. Fast.
FO300019183	UnderworldTalk1
FO300019184	What is it? I'm very busy, you know.
FO300019185	UnderworldTalkCharonCutOff4
FO300019186	Yeah, whatever.
FO300019187	All right, all right, I'll just ask Ahzrukhal...
FO300019188	No.
FO300019189	I. Said. No.
FO300019190	Leave me alone.
FO300019191	Go. Away.
FO300019192	No.
FO300019193	Go away.
FO300019194	Ask Ahzrukhal.
FO300019195	Go sit down.
FO300019196	I can't afford that.
FO300019197	The price isn't going to change, if that's what you're hoping. They'll be here when you can cover the cost.
FO300019198	I still can't afford that.
FO300019199	Well, then I guess I can't sell them to you.
FO300019200	No way am I paying that. Forget it.
FO300019201	That's your choice. They're your caps, after all. I'm not going to try a hard sell here; someone else will buy them eventually.
FO300019202	2000 is a bit steep. 1200 for all three is a more reasonable offer.
FO300019203	I suppose I can accept that. It's a deal; the kids are yours. I'll have them delivered to the front gate for you.
FO300019204	If I may, you might want to keep a close eye on them. They can be willful at times. Good luck.
FO300019205	That sounds like a good deal. I'll take it.
FO300019206	Fair enough. It's a pleasure to do business with you again.
FO300019207	I'll have the kids delivered to the front gate. And, may I recommend keeping a close eye on them? They're clever little bastards.
FO300019208	A wise decision. It's a pleasure to do business with you.
FO300019209	I'll have the kids delivered to the front gate. And, may I recommend keeping a close eye on them? They're clever little bastards.
FO300019210	Great, let's talk price.
FO300019211	Are you sure? That's a shame. I thought we had a good thing going here. Well, you know where to find us.
FO300019212	I never said I was buying. I just said I want them.
FO300019213	I'm sorry, what?
FO300019214	I hope you're not trying to strong-arm me, friend. I'd be more than happy to cut both your legs off before you even think you have one to stand on.
FO300019215	You've got some kids out there. I want them.
FO300019216	You do? Hell, that's great news. They'll work out well for you, I think. Full of energy. Great for small jobs now, and bigger loads down the road.
FO300019217	I'm sure we can come to a reasonable agreement; something you'll find affordable.
FO300019218	I was thinking about buying some slaves.
FO300019219	Right, right. 2000 caps was the figure I quoted. The price still stands if you're still interested.
FO300019220	We'd talked about the kids.
FO300019221	Of course. So you know what we have to offer; I assure you that you won't find quality like this anywhere else.
FO300019222	Now how exactly can Paradise Falls accomodate your needs?
FO300019223	I've seen your selection.
FO300019224	Ah, fully engrossed in the trade, are we? I'm glad you came to see me, instead of trying to work around me. Easier to get along this way.
FO300019225	There are some prime specimens out there. Have you had a chance to look them over?
FO300019226	Well then, you and I are a perfect fit. You want to buy slaves, and I want to sell them.
FO300019227	There are some prime specimens out there. Have you had a chance to look them over?
FO300019228	MQ07FortySlavesBought
FO300019229	The little shits are your problem now. I see 'em around here again, I'm gonna shoot 'em. We clear?
FO300019230	Can you believe it? He is growing up so fast.
FO300019231	Can you believe it? She is growing up so fast.
FO300019232	Happy birthday!
FO300019233	Happy birthday!
FO300019234	Happy birthday!
FO300019235	Happy birthday!
FO300019236	Happy birthday!
FO300019237	Surprise!
FO300019238	Surprise!
FO300019239	All right, Butch.
FO300019240	Hey, Officer Gomez. Nice party, huh?
FO300019241	Can it. I've had it with you, Butch. Your mother is going to hear about this little incident.
FO300019242	What'd he tell you, it was my fault? You didn't hear what he said to me!
FO300019243	What'd she tell you, it was my fault? You didn't hear what she said to me!
FO300019244	I'm not going to tolerate any more of your bullying.
FO300019245	Fine. Tell my mom. Big deal. Are we done?
FO300019246	For now. Just remember, I'm keeping my eye on you.
FO300019247	Really, I was the one who started it. It wasn't his fault.
FO300019248	Really? Well, if you say so. I'll stay out of it if that's the way you want it.
FO300019249	Please don't do that. I know you don't like Butch, but if you start picking fights with him, how are you any better?
FO300019250	Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself, but don't go looking for trouble. There's trouble enough in this world without adding to it.
FO300019251	Well, now, that's more than enough lecturing for a birthday party! Go on and enjoy yourself.
FO300019252	Actually, I was the one that started it. It's easy to make him mad.
FO300019253	He tried to take my birthday present!
FO300019254	You let me handle this. And try to stay out of the way.
FO300019255	I wish we didn't have to invite him, but there just aren't that many children your age in the Vault.
FO300019256	In any case, you'll have to learn to deal with bullies. The world is full of people much worse than Butch, I'm afraid.
FO300019257	But don't let him ruin your birthday. Go on, I bet there's someone else waiting to give you a present!
FO300019258	He tried to take the sweetroll Mrs. Palmer gave me!
FO300019259	Don't worry about it, sir. It was nothing.
FO300019260	That's fine, son. I'm glad to see you're not letting Butch bully you.
FO300019261	He's going to be a handful in a few years if his mother doesn't take him in hand.
FO300019262	Well, no harm done then. Why don't you get back to enjoying your party.
FO300019263	It was nothing. Just boys being boys.
FO300019264	Good for you. Don't let Butch start to bully you or he'll never stop. I've seen his type before.
FO300019265	He's going to be a handful in a few years if his mother doesn't take him in hand.
FO300019266	Well, no harm done then. Why don't you get back to enjoying your party.
FO300019267	I'm glad to hear it. Once you start letting bullies push you around, you'll never see the end of it.
FO300019268	Come on now, I bet there's someone else out there with a present for you!
FO300019269	Don't worry, Dad. I can handle Butch.
FO300019270	Stanley, you turned the lights on too fast. You blinded the poor kid!
FO300019271	Butch! What do you think you're doing? Leave him alone!
FO300019272	Butch! What are you doing? Hitting a girl, and on her birthday for heaven's sakes!
FO300019273	You all right, son? He didn't hurt you, did he?
FO300019274	Did he hurt you, honey?
FO300019275	Okay. "I'm sorry three times!" Ha! That's exactly what you said to say!
FO300019276	Oh man! You got me!
FO300019277	I guess I accept your apology!
FO300019278	<Sigh.> Okay. I'm sorry.
FO300019279	Good. You did it. Now I'll talk to you.
FO300019280	I'm sorry! There, that's three.
FO300019281	Keep 'em coming. Pappa said that's the right thing to do.
FO300019282	I'm sorry.
FO300019283	That's good. Keep going.
FO300019284	Forget it, I don't care. I'm out of here.
FO300019285	Fine. Hmph.
FO300019286	What's it going to take for you to forgive me?
FO300019287	When I was bad, my pappa made me apologize three times. Then he decided if I was really or sorry or not.
FO300019288	Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
FO300019289	No! They always just say sorry, but then it turns out to be a bunch of lies.
FO300019290	How can I ever trust a grown-up again?
FO300019291	Don't be like that. I'm sorry for being mean.
FO300019292	Okay, I forgive you.
FO300019293	Look, kid. There's no such thing as monsters.
FO300019294	Then you can make these things go away!
FO300019295	Hey, kid. It's okay. I'm a big, tough guy. I can take care of you!
FO300019296	Hey, kid. It's okay. I'm a big, tough lady. I can take care of you!
FO300019297	Did you know the others in town very well?
FO300019298	Naw. People don't like to stay long in Grayditch. The D.C. Ruins aren't a great place to make a home, you know?
FO300019299	Is there any special way to hurt them?
FO300019300	My pappa had a gun, and he said it hurt those things, but he said they were the dumbest Fuckin' Ants he ever saw.
FO300019301	He kept telling everyone to "shoot for their antenner" whatever that means.
FO300019302	Have they always been around?
FO300019303	Naw. Those things started coming around only in the last few months.
FO300019304	Okay kid, I said I'd do it. Now scram!
FO300019305	There's an old portashelter next to the diner near my house. I'll be waiting inside for you to come back.
FO300019306	And don't you dare leave me alone!
FO300019307	Is there anywhere you can hide while I search?
FO300019308	Well, there is the personal shelter next to the old diner.
FO300019309	I'll head over there and wait inside. Hurry back!
FO300019310	Okay. I'll go look for your father.
FO300019311	You will? Really? Thanks a whole lot!
FO300019312	My house is the one closest to the huge sign and the old diner.
FO300019313	What happened here?
FO300019314	It used to be kinda' nice. No one bothered us there, I guess because we were so close to D.C.
FO300019315	There was seven of us living there in tall, old brick houses. I think I'm the last one left. Those things took everyone else.
FO300019316	Can you tell me more about the things attacking Grayditch?
FO300019317	Well, they're big ugly things that crawl around on six legs. They got huge teeth and skitter around grabbing everything in their path.
FO300019318	My pappa would always say they were Fuckin' Ants. Well, that's what he used to call them anyway.
FO300019319	I just call 'em Fire Ants.
FO300019320	All right, I'm sorry. Calm down and tell me what's going on.
FO300019321	Is that a warning, or a threat?
FO300019322	See! I knew it! You don't care! No one ever cares!
FO300019323	Sorry, kid. Help costs caps, and you look pretty broke to me.
FO300019324	You grown-ups are all the same! All you care about is your stuff!
FO300019325	My pappa is missing and I think the ants may have gotten him! I hope they get you too!
FO300019326	I'd like to help, but I need to know more first.
FO300019327	Okay kid. I'm going to say it once. Stop your whining!
FO300019328	No! You don't care! The grown-ups never cared! Now they're all dead! Well, fine! You'll just die too!
FO300019329	Unless you tell me what the problem is I can't help you.
FO300019330	THOSE things! It's all their fault! They did this to us!
FO300019331	Hey, hey. Calm down. It's going to be okay. I promise.
FO300019332	What the heck is your problem?
FO300019333	Calm down, kid.
FO300019334	Those what? What's the matter?
FO300019335	I need you to repair my equipment.
FO300019336	I can't imagine why she'd be more popular. Even assuming this is all true.
FO300019337	What're you suggesting, you little brat? I may not be on the science team anymore, but I still know how to keep records!
FO300019338	Here! They probably don't even remember, but I kept the records of that first council meeting. Take them, if it'll put them in their place!
FO300019339	Do you have any hard evidence of all this?
FO300019340	Of course I do! A good scientist always keeps track of their data!
FO300019341	Here! They probably don't even remember, but I kept the records of that first council meeting. Take them, if it'll put them in their place!
FO300019342	If that's so, why are you stuck down here?
FO300019343	About 18 years ago, Li and her ambitious little team of backbiters showed up. Ruined everything around here, they did!
FO300019344	She came in with her big "Purity Project" pipe dream, and my whole staff started working with her, those traitors!
FO300019345	She even took my seat on the council. By then, I was glad to leave it behind. But hell if I'm leaving the city I made great!
FO300019346	So, you used to be in charge? How did you end up here?
FO300019347	That lasted until 'bout 18 years ago, when those ambitious backbiters like Li and her little team showed up.
FO300019348	She came in with her big "Purity Project" pipe dream, and my whole staff started working with her, those traitors!
FO300019349	She even took my seat on the council. By then, I was glad to leave it behind. But hell if I'm leaving the city I made great!
FO300019350	You were on the City Council? That's hard to believe.
FO300019351	Well, start believing or start walking! Remnants of the Naval Research Institute cleared the Mirelurks off this wreck about 40 years ago.
FO300019352	We were looking for new lab-space, and this bucket of bolts just happened to have a well-preserved science bay on it.
FO300019353	Everything else just grew up around that lab once we got it up and running. The science team was led by one "H. Pinkerton."
FO300019354	Setting the record straight is exactly my goal.
FO300019355	For that, you have to go all the way back to when remnants of the Naval Research Institute cleared the Mirelurks off this wreck about 40 years ago.
FO300019356	We were looking for new lab-space, and this bucket of bolts just happened to have a well-preserved science bay on it.
FO300019357	Everything else just grew up around that lab once we got it up and running. The science team was led by one "H. Pinkerton."
FO300019358	Oh, right. I sort of lose track of time talking about the old girl.
FO300019359	Enough about Rivet City.
FO300019360	I think I get the idea. Let me ask you something else.
FO300019361	What now?
FO300019362	Is that it then?
FO300019363	Alright then.
FO300019364	Anything else?
FO300019365	What's your take on the Republic?
FO300019366	Well, the Republic of Dave is the only true sovereign nation in the Wasteland. The only really civilized place left in the world.
FO300019367	One day, all wastelanders will be citizens in the republic, and know the greatness of their president.
FO300019368	Any future plans for the Republic, Mister President?
FO300019369	We have plenty of food and water here, and the compound is fairly safe. I'm glad the children can be raised here, away from the Wasteland.
FO300019370	I'd like to see more trading done with the local caravans, but Dave's afraid their outside influence could weaken the Republic.
FO300019371	Dave is a great leader. He's going to bring civilization back to the Wasteland. One day, they'll say it all started here.
FO300019372	Dave is in charge. When he's not around, I'm in charge. If you want anything else, go to the Museum of Dave on the left side of the compound.
FO300019373	The Republic of Dave offers a rich history rivaling that of the great nations before the war.
FO300019374	President Daddy is awesome! He buys all sorts of neat toys that we get to play with!
FO300019375	Everyone says that daddy is the best man, ever ever. I don't know, but that's what Shawna says, so I guess it's true.
FO300019376	I'd like to discuss the election with you.
FO300019377	Are you kidding? Dave is dead. How can there be an election with a dead candidate?
FO300019378	Oh yeah? What about it?
FO300019379	The election is still going on. What do you want to know?
FO300019380	I'll help you if I can.
FO300019381	Election time is always exciting around here.
FO300019382	MacCready sent me. I'm here to rescue you.
FO300019383	God, why didn't you say that?
FO300019384	Come on, let's go before they change their minds. I don't like the way that mungo looks at me.
FO300019385	Yeah, yeah. Okay.
FO300019386	Don't make a big deal out of it. You'll blow our cover.
FO300019387	Do you want to get rescued or not?
FO300019388	Rescued? This is a pretty stupid way to rescue anybody, mungo.
FO300019389	Pipe down, short stuff. I'm trying to get you out of here.
FO300019390	What? That's a load of shit. We're not stupid, you know. We've seen what you mungos are like.
FO300019391	If you say so.
FO300019392	Just follow me out of the complex. Then we can talk.
FO300019393	Keep quiet, will you? Let's get out of here, then we can talk.
FO300019394	I'm telling you right now, as soon as we get out of here, we're making a run for it. You want to try and shoot us, you can.
FO300019395	Look, I came from Little Lamplight.
FO300019396	You did? You better not be lying. Fine, let's go.
FO300019397	Fine. Would you rather stay here with the Slavers?
FO300019398	So if you're serious, let's get moving.
FO300019399	RDPackageDone
FO300019400	I'm going to win this.
FO300019401	Hmm. I suppose voting for Dave is the patriotic thing to do.
FO300019402	All done! Dave is the best!
FO300019403	Fingers crossed.
FO300019404	Good luck, Dave. You have my vote.
FO300019405	Ah, Dave. Lead our Republic to glory!
FO300019406	Let's see what we have here.
FO300019407	A vote for Rosie?
FO300019408	Bob!?
FO300019409	Wait a minute, has somebody tampered with the ballot box?
FO300019410	Well, looks like another triumphant victory for myself.
FO300019411	Well, despite the hiccup, it looks like I am still declared the winner.
FO300019412	ROSIE? Rosie can't be president! NO! This is unfair! This can't be! FINE! I'm LEAVING! See how you people do without me! Enjoy your new president!
FO300019413	BOB? Bob can't be president! NO! This is unfair! This can't be! FINE! I'm LEAVING! See how you people do without me! Enjoy your new president!
FO300019414	You're going to be sorry, you little smartmouth.
FO300019415	What, are you two best friends now? Hey, Wally, I think Paul's gone soft on us.
FO300019416	UnderworldAhzurkhalRadioChatter
FO300019417	Quiet makes people stop drinking. Turn the radio back on.
FO300019418	Why would you do that? These people want their music.
FO300019419	Hey! Leave that alone. If I wanted it off, I'd turn it off.
FO300019420	That's better.
FO300019421	Thank you. Now leave it alone.
FO300019422	Now that's more like it. Music makes the sweet sweet and the bitter all the more bitter.
FO300019423	Stop messing with that radio.
FO300019424	Hey, leave that radio alone.
FO300019425	What do you do with the money you make down here?
FO300019426	The rest we give to Quinn to trade for stuff we need whenever he goes out.
FO300019427	Let me see what you have for sale.
FO300019428	If any of the armor fails to protect your life, I'll give you a full refund.
FO300019429	Take a look, it all works.
FO300019430	Sure thing, human.
FO300019431	Suit yourself. But you're missing out. Do you want something else?
FO300019432	Travel? Where do you go?
FO300019433	Oh, here and there and everywhere. I've explored all up and down the coast, from the Commonwealth, to the Pitt, all the way down to Crater Banks.
FO300019434	I also do a fair bit of trading. You see, folks here, they don't have much of a connection to the outside.
FO300019435	So I move their goods and caps out to the Wastes and bring back in what I trade for 'em.
FO300019436	Suit yourself. But you're missing out. Do you want something else?
FO300019437	Where do you go?
FO300019438	Oh, here and there and everywhere. I've explored all up and down the coast, from the Commonwealth, to the Pitt, all the way down to Crater Banks.
FO300019439	I also do a fair bit of trading. You see, folks here, they don't have much of a connection to the outside.
FO300019440	So I move their goods and caps out to the Wastes and bring back in what I trade for 'em.
FO300019441	Oh, God. I'm out of here.
FO300019442	Suit yourself. I'll be here if you change your mind.
FO300019443	Nice to meet you, Quinn.
FO300019444	You too, stranger. I know a lot of people around here don't take kindly to humans wandering around, but I've met a lot of your people in my travels.
FO300019445	What? You're not going to tell me how rare it is to see a human in Underworld?
FO300019446	Me? No, not at all. I'm used to your people. Truth is, I spend most of my time away from Underworld.
FO300019447	Watch out for your own body parts, you creepy bastard.
FO300019448	I'll do that.
FO300019449	You're disgusting.
FO300019450	You be careful. I don't want you hurting yourself.
FO300019451	You keep your parts to yourself and let's talk about something else.
FO300019452	Are you all right?
FO300019453	So, you're the town drunk, huh?
FO300019454	Where can I get a drink around here? You seem like the right person to ask.
FO300019455	Oh yeah, the generators, I don't know where they are, you'll have to ask Winthrop.
FO300019456	Oh yeah, the generators, I don't know where they are, you'll have to ask Winthrop.
FO300019457	I need medical supplies.
FO300019458	I think I can help you out.
FO300019459	Be careful with these. They're not toys, you know.
FO300019460	Yes, what do you need?
FO300019461	Very well. What do you require?
FO300019462	Have you ever heard of a guy named Gob?
FO300019463	Gob? Yes, of course!
FO300019464	Do you know him? Have you seen him? Is he alright?

FO300019467	Jesus, this place is falling apart.
FO300019468	Poor Winthrop, the guy really needs some help.
FO300019469	One mechanic just isn't enough to keep this place going, I guess.
FO300019470	If I knew how, I'd give Winthrop a hand, but I have no idea how all of this old junk works.
FO300019471	My part in this is all done. Sorry, kid.
FO300019472	Please don't go! Please!
FO300019473	We have to get back at these things for killing my pappa! We just gotta!
FO300019474	Fine, I'll take care of everything.
FO300019475	You gotta stop it so this can't happen to anyone else's family ever again!
FO300019476	I wish I had met you a long time ago, then maybe my dad would still be alive.
FO300019477	Sorry, kid. Your old man is ant food.
FO300019478	Well you don't have to be such a meanie about it.
FO300019479	I already knew anyway, Mr. Smarty. I snuck back home a little while ago and found him laying there.
FO300019480	Now he's dead and I'm by myself. Not that you'd care.
FO300019481	Your father's dead.
FO300019482	I guess I already knew anyway, I just needed to see for myself. Besides, I'm too tired to cry anymore.
FO300019483	I guess I already knew. Besides, I'm too tired to cry anymore.
FO300019484	Bryan, I'm sorry, but your father is dead.
FO300019485	I guess I already knew anyway, I just needed to see for myself. Besides, I'm too tired to cry anymore.
FO300019486	I guess I already knew. Besides, I'm too tired to cry anymore.
FO300019487	Looks like all the votes are in, Mister President.
FO300019488	That would be Bob, Shawna, Jessica, Rosie and myself. In the Republic, if you're old enough to carry a weapon, you're old enough to vote.
FO300019489	Rosie and Jessica are usually here in the Capitol. Bob usually hangs out outside near the Brahmin pen.
FO300019490	Shawna runs the Museum of Dave, so you can find her there.
FO300019491	Who's eligible to vote?
FO300019492	Bob still hasn't voted, that dumb bastard.
FO300019493	Are the votes in, Mister President?
FO300019494	Jessica hasn't voted yet.
FO300019495	Are the votes in, Mister President?
FO300019496	Tell Shawna that Dave commands her to vote in the election. She'll come running, trust me.
FO300019497	Are the votes in, Mister President?
FO300019498	Not yet. Rosie still hasn't voted.
FO300019499	Are the votes in, Mister President?
FO300019500	Good, the votes are in. If you'll excuse me, I'll be getting started on tallying the numbers.
FO300019501	Oh yes, I almost forgot. Here's your caps. Keep this up and I may deign to make you a citizen, in a few years.
FO300019502	I know that. The people will see the results shortly, I assure you.
FO300019503	The people have re-elected me as their president.
FO300019504	It's great to see the democratic process at work.
FO300019505	So, what are the results, Mister President?
FO300019506	Rosie somehow came up with the most votes.
FO300019507	There must be some kind of bug in the voting system.
FO300019508	So, what are the results, Mister President?
FO300019509	Somehow Bob won the election.
FO300019510	I should have known the little bastard was conspiring against me.
FO300019511	So, what are the results, Mister President?
FO300019512	There was a tie.  Under these unique circumstances, I'll have to remain the leader until we know the results for sure.
FO300019513	So, what are the results, Mister President?
FO300019514	Under these unique circumstances, I'll have to remain the leader until we know the results for sure.
FO300019515	So, what are the results, Mister President?
FO300019516	Your dad's the Overseer. Can't you talk to him about Butch?
FO300019517	Come on. Don't ask me that. You know he would if I asked, but where would that leave me?
FO300019518	It's bad enough being the Overseer's daughter. If everyone knew I ran to daddy every time I had a problem, nobody would ever talk to me again.
FO300019519	We'll think of some way to get Butch back. I promise. But I'm not getting my father involved.
FO300019520	I wouldn't give him what he wanted. He says he's going to make me sorry later.
FO300019521	That jerk! I can't believe he'd try to ruin your birthday party!
FO300019522	Uh oh, your dad is giving me a look. I guess I'd better give everyone else a chance to talk to you.
FO300019523	Don't worry about me. I'm not scared of him.
FO300019524	I know. He thinks he's so tough. One of these days we'll figure out a way to get him back, okay?
FO300019525	I don't want to talk about it.
FO300019526	I know. Butch. What else is there to say, right?
FO300019527	Hey, forget him. Have fun. It's your birthday party!
FO300019528	God, what a jerk. I hate him! You'd think he'd be happy he actually got invited to your party.
FO300019529	I'm sorry. Are you going to be okay? Let's try to just have fun and forget about Butch for a while.
FO300019530	He wanted my sweetroll, but I told him off. <Lie.>
FO300019531	Wow. You're so tough. You'll have to teach me how to do that, sometime.
FO300019532	He's not worth worrying about anyway. "Most likely to end up a trash burner," right?
FO300019533	You never learn, do you? You can't help shooting your mouth off even when you know it's going to get you a bloody nose.
FO300019534	Uh oh, your dad is giving me a look. I'd better let everybody else have a turn with the birthday boy.
FO300019535	You never learn, do you? You can't help shooting your mouth off even when you know it's going to get you a bloody nose.
FO300019536	Uh oh, your dad is giving me a look. I'd better let everybody else have a turn with the birthday girl. We'll talk later, okay?
FO300019537	The jerk tried to steal my sweetroll.
FO300019538	God, he really is a butthead. Oh well. You can always count on Butch to make an ass of himself. Get it? Ha ha ha.
FO300019539	He's lucky Gomez stopped the fight before I really hurt him.
FO300019540	Right. That's exactly what I was thinking.
FO300019541	Jonas?
FO300019542	Hey doc. We're all set down here.
FO300019543	Have you heard the election results?
FO300019544	Dave won again? Well, he's the best choice.
FO300019545	He did?  Wow, I'd of never guessed that possible.
FO300019546	Did you hear Bob won the election?
FO300019547	Yes, but it's still quite a shock.
FO300019548	Did you hear Bob won the election?
FO300019549	I won it? Are you sure?
FO300019550	Looks like you won, Rosie!
FO300019551	I can't believe my ears.
FO300019552	Looks like you won, Rosie!
FO300019553	I didn't win it, huh? Well, there'll always be other elections.
FO300019554	Sorry you didn't win it, Rosie.
FO300019555	There'll always be other elections.
FO300019556	Sorry you didn't win it, Rosie.
FO300019557	Dave won it I'm sure.
FO300019558	Rosie won, huh? She better not try and boss me around, that's for damn sure.
FO300019559	Did you hear Rosie won the election?
FO300019560	I knew I'd win it.
FO300019561	Now I just got to name this place after me.
FO300019562	Looks like you'll be the new leader, Bob.
FO300019563	Who needs it. I'd prefer to be second in command anyway.
FO300019564	Results are in.  Better luck next year.
FO300019565	Hurray!
FO300019566	Did you hear that Dave won the election?
FO300019567	Why, did Dave get too old?
FO300019568	Did you hear that Dave lost the election?
FO300019569	Did Dave win it again? I'd have voted for him if they'd let me.
FO300019570	Did Dave win it again? I voted for him you know.
FO300019571	Rosie's going to be the new leader? What will Dave do?
FO300019572	Have you heard that Rosie won the election?
FO300019573	He actually won?
FO300019574	Have you heard that Bob won the election?
FO300019575	Mayor MacCready's the one who sent me to get you.
FO300019576	Really? I knew it! I knew he'd come to get us!
FO300019577	Didn't think he'd send a mungo like you to do it, though.
FO300019578	Nope. Never heard of it.
FO300019579	Sure. Most mungos like you don't know where it is. We like it that way.
FO300019580	But we gotta get out of here. If you can help us, I'll show you where it is. Maybe Mayor will even be nice to you. But only if you help us.
FO300019581	Yeah, I've heard of it.
FO300019582	Well we need to get out of here and get back there. Right now. So you gotta help us, okay?
FO300019583	Why would I help you? What's in it for me?
FO300019584	Look, we're not supposed to be in here. We live in Little Lamplight. Ever heard of it?
FO300019585	Don't worry, I've got a plan.
FO300019586	You do? Great!
FO300019587	Whatever you do, make sure you turn off these collars. You saw what happened to that other guy.
FO300019588	Get lost, kid.
FO300019589	Thanks for nothing, ass.
FO300019590	How can I get you out of here?
FO300019591	Can't you just shoot them all?
FO300019592	I'm with you so far. Keep going.
FO300019593	So I found this old terminal in the building here. Dusty, but it turns on with a little fixing. Like I said, I'm super smart.
FO300019594	I know they use a terminal to turn the collars on and off. So if you can link the terminals, I can turn the collars off and they won't even know.
FO300019595	Then we just gotta open the fence, sneak past the mungos with guns, and get the hell out of here. Sounds good, right? You in?
FO300019596	Skip to the point, short stuff.
FO300019597	Fine. But I'm telling you, it's good stuff. Really.
FO300019598	We gotta turn the collars off, or else if we try to leave we'll get all chunkified. Don't want that. So we gotta use a terminal for it.
FO300019599	I can use the terminal I fixed up in here, but I need it added to the network first. Main terminal is in the boss guy's room, so you gotta do that.
FO300019600	I just need to know what to do right now.
FO300019601	Man, you're cranky.
FO300019602	Fine, here's what you do. You go on into the boss guy's room, and use his terminal. Get the one in here added to the network.
FO300019603	Think you can handle that, mungo?
FO300019604	Okay, tell me the whole plan. All of it.
FO300019605	Okay, cool. You'll like it, really. It's going to work, I know it.
FO300019606	We're stuck behind this fence here. But even if we get past the fence, and the mungos with guns, we still can't leave.
FO300019607	They got these collars on us, right? Make us blow up if we try and get out. No way to get the collars off, so we gotta stop them from blowing up.
FO300019608	That's the best you can come up with? Don't you have any other ideas?
FO300019609	Well, I mean, Squirrel thinks maybe he could use the computer in here to turn off the collars.
FO300019610	Hang on. I'll get Squirrel, and he can tell you what to do.
FO300019611	No way. I can't take them all on.
FO300019612	No? You sure?
FO300019613	Well, okay. I guess maybe we could try Squirrel's plan. He says it'll work, but I don't know. It means using computers and stuff.
FO300019614	Hang on. Let me get him, and he can tell you the plan. I don't understand some of it, anyway.
FO300019615	I don't have any water to spare, but I'll be back when I find some.
FO300019616	I know you're probably just yanking my chain, but it's not like I'm going anywhere. You know where to find me, ha ha ha.
FO300019617	Then I guess you're done for, because I'm not giving you any.
FO300019618	Yeah, that's what I figured. Can you at least shoot me in the head before you leave? I'm out of ammo or I'd do it myself.
FO300019619	Sure, I can spare some water. <Give 1 water.>
FO300019620	You just saved my life. I won't forget it.
FO300019621	Where's the terminal I need to use?
FO300019622	I told you, it's in the boss guy's room. You gotta sneak in there or something. That's up to you to figure out, mungo.
FO300019623	Oh, come on. Aren't you mungos good for anything? I'm a kid, and I can do it. Why can't you?
FO300019624	Listen, if you can't make that work, then there might be one other way to do it, even for a stupid mungo like you.
FO300019625	There's a junction box along the wall in the eating area. Switch a few cables there, and we're good. So there you go.
FO300019626	Either you better be pretty good at fixing stuff, or you better learn how to use a terminal real fast.
FO300019627	You should go vote, if you haven't already.
FO300019628	Already did my part.
FO300019629	You're right, I'll go right now.
FO300019630	I went and voted.
FO300019631	I guess you're right, I'll go right now.
FO300019632	But I did already!
FO300019633	Oh no, Dave sent you to tell me that didn't he? I'll go right away I promise.
FO300019634	I'm so sorry, I'll go right away I promise.
FO300019635	Who the hell made you the boss?
FO300019636	Anyway, I did it already.
FO300019637	Fine, I'll get it out of the way.
FO300019638	Of course I voted. I was the first to vote. Now I'm just waiting for the rest of the votes to come in.
FO300019639	Did you already vote, Mister President?
FO300019640	It's none of my business. I'm just passing through.
FO300019641	Damn straight. And I'd advise you to just keep on walking.
FO300019642	Listen, for a share of the water I'll help you take out those jokers.
FO300019643	Done.
FO300019644	I hope you shoot as quick as you talk. You got a deal. Take 'em out!
FO300019645	I'm taking the water. All of it. And don't try to stop me.
FO300019646	Oh yeah? We had a friendly dispute going here before you went and stuck your nose in. Come on, take him out!
FO300019647	If that's the way you want it.
FO300019648	Why don't we all split it? There's really no point in getting killed for it.
FO300019649	Yeah, you're probably right. Besides, just as likely you'd wait for us to finish each other off then take it all for yourself.
FO300019650	It's never too late to learn. There's enough here to split three ways.
FO300019651	I guess I'll take being robbed over being killed. But I don't have to like it. Take your water and get the hell out of here.
FO300019652	No point in any more killing over this water. Let's split it and walk away.
FO300019653	Back off! We found it first.
FO300019654	I don't see what that has to do with anything. We need this water, and we're taking it.
FO300019655	You're not going anywhere with our water.
FO300019656	Lower your weapons, goddammit! I'm not looking for a fight. We just need this water!
FO300019657	You got the one on the left, Billy! If he takes one more step, let him have it.
FO300019658	We ain't afraid of you. If you want a fight, we'll give it to you. Now just take it easy!
FO300019659	You're not taking our water!
FO300019660	UnderworldTalkGretaMisterCrowleyFood5
FO300019661	See? I knew you'd come around.
FO300019662	Sure. I'll get it to you as soon as I can.
FO300019663	You got it.
FO300019664	Don't mention it, my friend. It's what I'm here for.
FO300019665	It's nothing, I simply want to ensure that all my friends in Underworld are as happy as can be.
FO300019666	No thanks are wanted or asked for, it is my humble duty to ensure that you get what you need.
FO300019667	If you say so, Carol.
FO300019668	I want to believe you, Carol. I really do.
FO300019669	Oh, Greta, you worry too much. I'm fine, I'm fine. Just have a lot on my mind. It'll pass. Nothing to worry about.
FO300019670	There's nothing to worry about, Greta. You're so sweet, always thinking about me. But I'm fine, I promise.
FO300019671	UnderworldTalkCarolGretaTired2
FO300019672	I was saying that you need to get some rest. You're falling asleep up here. You never sleep through a whole night anymore. I hear you getting up.
FO300019673	<sighs> I was saying that you need to get some rest, Carol. You hardly ever sleep at night, don't think that I haven't noticed.

FO300019675	UnderworldTalkCharonAhzurkhalBouncer4
FO300019676	I don't know how many times I've told you about this. I don't want to have to do it again.
FO300019677	I'm getting tired of having this conversation. Let's not go through it again. Got me?
FO300019678	I'm glad we had this little talk.
FO300019679	You'd best unfuck yourself, Charon. Or I'll just go ahead and "cancel" our contract.
FO300019680	Good. I'm glad we're clear on that.
FO300019681	UnderworldTalkCharonAhzurkhalBouncer3
FO300019682	<growls> Whatever.
FO300019683	<grumbles> Yeah. Sure.
FO300019684	Yeah, whatever.
FO300019685	Sure.
FO300019686	UnderworldTalkCharonAhzurkhalBouncer2
FO300019687	I want you to keep a closer eye on these bastards. I caught one of them trying to swipe some booze from the shelf when my back was turned.
FO300019688	Look, despite all the grunting, I know you're not stupid. You need to start acting like you have half a brain and keep a closer watch on things.
FO300019689	I'm getting a bit tired of having to do my job and your job. Watch these drunks more carefully. I'm getting sick of my stock disappearing.
FO300019690	What do I have you here for? To watch the bar, right? So get your thumb out of your ass and start paying attention to what's going on around you.
FO300019691	Are you blind? Never mind, don't bother grunting a response. You need to watch these assholes better. Some stuff has turned up missing.
FO300019692	UnderworldTalkCharonAhzurkhalBouncer1
FO300019693	What?
FO300019694	<grunts>
FO300019695	Alright, I can't even talk to you about this right now. Let's just deal with it later.
FO300019696	Never mind, man. Let's just talk about this later.
FO300019697	C'mon, I'm worried that I'm going to find you dead one of these days. Listen to yourself. You can barely talk. You're a mess, man.
FO300019698	This is what I mean, Patches. You're a mess. I'm worried about you, man. I really am. You're falling apart.

FO300019704	I don't know, maybe it's for the best. Not that I didn't love her, but this life sucks.

FO300019716	Take a step back, there. I don't want your slime on me. Tell you what, another drink should clear that cough up.
FO300019717	You should see someone about that cough. In the mean time, keep your distance.
FO300019718	Sounds like you need some of Akzurkhal's special cough medicine.
FO300019719	You might want to see Doc Barrows about that cough. But have another drink before you do.
FO300019720	Shame the doc is dead, he could've done something about that cough. Ah well, just have another drink. It'll go away.

FO300019743	Well, give the report, you old bucket of bolts. I haven't got all day.
FO300019744	Well? Do you think I asked just out of curiosity? Give me the report, dammit.
FO300019745	UnderworldTalkCerberusWinthropDiagnostic1
FO300019746	UnderworldTalkGretaFood4
FO300019747	Oh, awesome. Thank you, Greta. I'm starving.
FO300019748	Thank you, Greta.
FO300019749	I'll be here.
FO300019750	I'll try not to starve before you get back.
FO300019751	Thanks, Greta.
FO300019752	UnderworldTalkGretaFood3
FO300019753	I'm not sure, I'll go check.
FO300019754	Sit tight, I'll find out for you as soon as I can.
FO300019755	I'll go have a look.
FO300019756	I can go find out for you.
FO300019757	You must be feeling brave. I'll go have a look.
FO300019758	Wow. Well, okay. I'll go have a look.
FO300019759	UnderworldTalkGretaFood2
FO300019760	Got any more of that Squirrel-on-a-Stick?
FO300019761	I'll take some of those Squirrel Bits, if you have any more.
FO300019762	You got any of Carol's special Squirrel Stew?
FO300019763	You ever wonder where all those iguanas come from? I do. I guess it don't matter, 'cause they sure are tasty. You got any?
FO300019764	I could really go for some Iguana. You got any left?
FO300019765	Doc says I should eat more Mutfruit. You guys got any?
FO300019766	You got any of those Mutfruits that Quinn brought back?
FO300019767	Sure could go for some squirrel, if you have any more.
FO300019768	I could go for some noodles. You got any?
FO300019769	UnderworldTalkGretaFood1
FO300019770	Hungry again? What do you need?
FO300019771	Everyone's gotta eat, I suppose. What'll you have?
FO300019772	Just can't get enough, can you?
FO300019773	Get it while it's lukewarm.
FO300019774	Yeah, hon, what do you need?
FO300019775	What do you want?
FO300019776	Yeah, sure, what do you need?
FO300019777	That's what I'm here for.
FO300019778	Sure, kitchen's open. What do you want?
FO300019779	No refunds if you don't keep it down this time. Now, what can I get you?
FO300019780	UnderworldTalkGretaDrink4
FO300019781	I'll just be here sobering up until you get back.
FO300019782	Relief can't come soon enough.
FO300019783	Thank you, Greta.
FO300019784	Thanks, Greta.
FO300019785	UnderworldTalkGretaDrink3
FO300019786	Sure, if you don't mind waiting a few minutes.
FO300019787	We just got some more in, I'll grab that for you in a minute.
FO300019788	I think we can do that.
FO300019789	Sure, no problem. I'll get it for you in a second.
FO300019790	One more, comin' up.
FO300019791	Sure, no problem.
FO300019792	You're really going for a record, aren't you?
FO300019793	Alright, but if you pass out, I'm just going to roll you into the fire.
FO300019794	You should take it easy on this stuff. You know that you get all drippy when you're drunk.
FO300019795	Yeah, no problem.
FO300019796	You got it.
FO300019797	UnderworldTalkGretaDrink2
FO300019798	Give me a beer.
FO300019799	Beer.
FO300019800	I'll take a scotch.
FO300019801	Scotch, straight up. In fact, just give me the bottle.
FO300019802	If you've got any more of that scotch laying around, I'll take some of that.
FO300019803	Bring me some of that whisky, you know, the stuff that Quinn got from that guy up north.
FO300019804	Bring me something brown and alcoholic.
FO300019805	Kentucky straight. You remember Kentucky? Nah, you're too young.
FO300019806	How about some of that whiskey?
FO300019807	I'll take some of that vodka, if you have it.
FO300019808	I really don't care, just make sure it has liquor in it.
FO300019809	Bring me something warm and painful.
FO300019810	I don't care, really. Whatever takes the pain away.
FO300019811	UnderworldTalkGretaDrink1
FO300019812	Sure hon, what do you need?
FO300019813	Yeah, no problem. What's your poison?
FO300019814	Of course, what's up?
FO300019815	No problem, drunky. What do you need?
FO300019816	That's my job, what do you need?
FO300019817	No problem at all. What can I get for you?
FO300019818	That's what I'm here for.
FO300019819	UnderworldTalkCrowleyGretaFood4
FO300019820	Fine. I suppose I can choke down some of the squirrel stew.
FO300019821	Very well, bring me some of that disgusting iguana.
FO300019822	UnderworldTalkCrowleyGretaFood3
FO300019823	Well then. What'll it be, Crowley?
FO300019824	Looks like you're stuck eating our slop then. Now what do you want?
FO300019825	Well then, what are you complaining about? Oh, I forgot, you're a bitter bastard. Just tell me what you want to eat.
FO300019826	UnderworldTalkCrowleyGretaFood2
FO300019827	If I thought there was a chance that it would be better than this slop, I'd do that. But as it stands, this is my only option.
FO300019828	Very funny, Greta. I'd happily prepare my own meals if I could ever get anything was wasn't moldy, rotten, or still squirming.
FO300019829	UnderworldTalkCrowleyGretaFood1
FO300019830	Not this again. Look, I've been telling you every day for ten years, if you don't like it, go make your own damn food.
FO300019831	If you don't like what we have, Crowley, you can always go hunt rats in the tunnels with the ferals.
FO300019832	UnderworldTalkAhzurkhalCharonOrders3
FO300019833	Yeah.
FO300019834	It's done.
FO300019835	Did it. Done.
FO300019836	Already done.
FO300019837	Yep.
FO300019838	UnderworldTalkAhzurkhalCharonOrders4
FO300019839	Good. You know how I hate to worry.
FO300019840	I'm glad to hear it. I knew I could trust you.
FO300019841	Good, Charon. Good. I know you wouldn't lie to me. You aren't that stupid. Hahahaha!
FO300019842	Good dog. Keep it up and maybe I'll give you a treat.
FO300019843	Excellent. I'll have another task for you soon.
FO300019844	UnderworldTalkAhzurkhalCharonOrders2
FO300019845	That little chore, the one we talked about yesterday. I trust that it won't be something I have to hear about again, right?
FO300019846	I gave you an assignment. I don't have to worry about it not being done, do I? You did do what I asked, yes?
FO300019847	I want to make sure that we're not going to have another disagreement. You did what I asked you to do, didn't you?
FO300019848	I've got something on my mind, Charon. I had asked you to do something and you never reported back to me. You did it, didn't you?
FO300019849	UnderworldTalkAhzurkhalCharonOrders1
FO300019850	Yeah?
FO300019851	What now?
FO300019852	What?
FO300019853	UnderworldTalkCarolGretaHealth4
FO300019854	I'm worried about you, that's all. Just think about what I said.
FO300019855	You know that I can't stop worrying about you. Just think about it, okay?
FO300019856	UnderworldTalkCarolGretaHealth3
FO300019857	Oh, the customers are fine. So long as they've got you to being them food and drinks, they couldn't care less.
FO300019858	They don't need to worry about me, Greta, and neither do you. I'll be okay.
FO300019859	UnderworldTalkCarolGretaHealth2
FO300019860	C'mon, Carol. It's me, I can see through you. It's gotten so bad that the customers have started to notice.
FO300019861	UnderworldTalkCarolGretaHealth1
FO300019862	What? Oh, I'm fine, Greta. I'm just fine, miles away, you know?
FO300019863	Oh, Greta, baby. You don't need to worry about me, I was just lost in my thoughts. You know how it is.
FO300019864	UnderworldTalkAhzrukhalWinthropPatchwork6
FO300019865	I'm not threatening you, I'm just sayin'. No equipment. No business. Either way, my problem is solved. Think about it. We'll talk later.
FO300019866	Oh, you'd be surprised. I may be old, but this place'd shut down without me. Just think about what I said, we'll talk later.
FO300019867	UnderworldTalkAhzrukhalWinthropPatchwork5
FO300019868	Save your threats, old man. You don't have the balls.
FO300019869	Don't you threaten me. You wouldn't dare do that, these people would have your head.
FO300019870	UnderworldTalkAhzrukhalWinthropPatchwork4
FO300019871	And wouldn't it be a shame if your ventilation went down and all of your customers went to Carol's? Just think about it, Ahzrukhal.
FO300019872	Sure, sure, you're here to make money, and I fix all of your crap so that you can keep right on making that money. What would happen if I stopped?
FO300019873	UnderworldTalkAhzrukhalWinthropPatchwork3
FO300019874	He's a big boy, Winthrop. As long as he's got the caps, I'm going to sell him booze. I'm here to make money, not to babysit.
FO300019875	Stop serving him? This is a bar. How am I supposed to make money if I'm not serving booze? If he's got money, I'll give him whatever he asks for.
FO300019876	UnderworldTalkAhzrukhalWinthropPatchwork2
FO300019877	It's about Patchwork. You need to stop feeding him booze, Ahzrukhal. The boy can barely stand most of the time, and you just keep serving him.
FO300019878	I want you to stop giving Patchwork booze when he's already drunk. You're gonna kill the boy.
FO300019879	UnderworldTalkAhzrukhalWinthropPatchwork1
FO300019880	I'm not your "boy", Winthrop. What do you want?
FO300019881	Oh, look, if it isn't my favorite pain in the ass. What can I do for you, Winthrop?
FO300019882	Have you fixed that other fridge for me yet? Hrm? No? Than I've got no time for you, Winthrop. We'll talk later.
FO300019883	No time to talk right now, Winthrop. Come back later.
FO300019884	I'm getting tired of this.
FO300019885	Hey, if you got any better ideas, you go right ahead and get to work. Me? This is the best I got.
FO300019886	We got the terminal working, so I can turn off the collars, but we still gotta make it out of here. Past the guards.
FO300019887	Unless you can get rid of the guard near the pen, we're going nowhere. So you gonna help, or you just gonna complain?
FO300019888	"One step"? What the hell, kid.
FO300019889	Hey mungo, I never said the terminal was the only thing we'd need to do. It's important, but it won't get us out that front gate.
FO300019890	There's always at least one guard near the pen, and the terminal ain't gonna make the guard disappear. So you gotta do it.
FO300019891	Okay, great. What's next?
FO300019892	Well, with the terminal, I can turn off the collars and open the gate. But they're not gonna just let us walk out of here, you know?
FO300019893	There's always at least one guard near the pen, and someone's gotta get rid of him.
FO300019894	Since we can't just walk around like we own the place, you're gonna have to do it. You get me?
FO300019895	All done. The terminal should work for you now.
FO300019896	All right! You're okay for a mungo, you know that?
FO300019897	So we're one step closer to getting out of here.
FO300019898	Could I help with the election, Mister President?
FO300019899	Alright sure, why not. The people have a tendency to wait until the last minute to vote, but I'd just like to get it over with.
FO300019900	I'll spare a few caps if you just tell each of the adults to get over to the voting booth sometime today so I cinch the victory.
FO300019901	Not that I have anything to worry about. The people know who their leader is in this Republic.
FO300019902	I told you before: I'll spare a few caps if you just tell each of the adults to get over to the voting booth sometime today.
FO300019903	There's Jessica, Rosie, Bob, and Shawna. I already voted.
FO300019904	Remind me how can I help the election, Mister President.
FO300019905	RDTeacherTalk
FO300019906	Let's get class started.
FO300019907	So who can tell me how Dave saved the people from the wrath of Tom?
FO300019908	Somebody name three things Tom did wrong before Dave became the president.
FO300019909	Anybody know what year Dave took back the government for the people?
FO300019910	I hope you're paying attention, Rachael. I'll give another pop quiz. I'll do it.
FO300019911	Remember your homework is to prepare a speech on the "Merits of Dave."
FO300019912	So, I'll just get started on the tour of the museum then.
FO300019913	To my far right is the baby carriage that our great leader slept in as a newborn baby. Unlike most babies, he never cried and his poop didn't stink.
FO300019914	Dave had 8 siblings and made his own baseball team. The team was so good, in fact, the Wasteland team was so scared it never showed up to compete.
FO300019915	The briefcase is the very one Dave took with him when he became fed up with the poor ways that his father ran the nation.
FO300019916	Dave brought back many items from the Wasteland. It was artifacts like these that amassed the Republic's great wealth.
FO300019917	Dave collects many war collectibles, including holotapes and war weaponry.
FO300019918	This globe represents the whole planet that Dave traversed. Don't let its size fool you, the world is at least fifty times bigger than this.
FO300019919	I don't know who put that tire there.
FO300019920	These weapons were used against the USA before the bombs fell. Dave probably acquired these when he walked to China.
FO300019921	Dave is a world-renowned marksman, known for shooting an apple out of the hand of a Raider from across the Potomac.
FO300019922	Mounted to my left is the very head of the slain Deathclaw that Dave encountered during his quest through the Wastes.
FO300019923	I know what you're thinking, and no, that's not a Brahmin skull. Brahmin have two heads, so there'd have to be two skulls for it to be Brahmin.
FO300019924	Please, no touching.
FO300019925	And that's the tour! I hope you enjoyed it!
FO300019926	Forget it. This is ridiculous.
FO300019927	This is bull, man. You gotta help us out.
FO300019928	What the shit? Come on, you already did half the work. Just a little more and we're outta here. Don't screw us over now.
FO300019929	How am I supposed to get rid of the guards?
FO300019930	Man, can't you think of anything on your own?
FO300019931	Around midnight, there's only one guard. But it's that really mean guy, Forty. Still, probably your best chance to try something.
FO300019932	Do what you gotta do, you know? Just get him away from his post.
FO300019933	Okay, I'm on it.
FO300019934	Okay. Don't do anything stupid.
FO300019935	Okay. Don't do anything stupid.
FO300019936	CitTalkRothchildElderLyons5
FO300019937	All right, all right. I'll see what what I can do.
FO300019938	Rothchild, old friend, you're a brilliant technician. But this old man's patience is wearing thin. I want a full status report in three hours.
FO300019939	I come to you for results, not excuses, Rothchild. That robot could mean the difference between victory or defeat against the Enclave.
FO300019940	Precisely what I'd like to speak with you about. What's this I hear about power consumption actually increasing? We both know that's not an option.
FO300019941	What is it, Owyn? This robot isn't going to fix itself.
FO300019942	Hmm? Yes, yes. What is it? Robot to fix, and all that.
FO300019943	I understand, Peabody. But you'll need to make do the best you can. If our weapons can't penetrate that Enclave armor, we stand no chance.
FO300019944	Then make do with what you have. We may lack the Enclave's resources, but I'm counting on your ingenuity to make up for that!
FO300019945	I know the protocols, sir. But the equipment that they stole was very valuable. Our weapons are beginning to deteriorate without the spare parts.
FO300019946	CitTalkPeabodyElderLyons2
FO300019947	That name is not to be spoken within this Citadel. Do you understand? I wish it were not so, truly I do, but he is Outcast. He has been judged.
FO300019948	Scribe. You are not to speak the name of an Outcast in the walls of the Citadel. Is that understood?
FO300019949	Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
FO300019950	CitTalkBowditchElderLyons4
FO300019951	We have shortages all around, my friend. Make do the best you can. We may not have the Enclave's resources... but we do have you.
FO300019952	You'll make do, Bowditch. You always do.
FO300019953	I'm afraid that there may be a delay, sir. So far, I haven't been able to salvage a fellulator unit from the parts that we have on hand.
FO300019954	Excellent. I'm a bit concerned, though. Last week, you mentioned a possible delay in the secondary modifications?
FO300019955	I'm pleased to hear that. Do you anticipate any setbacks? Last month's progress was, well... let's call it "underwhelming."
FO300019956	You're a bit late today, sir. I was afraid that you weren't coming. As per my report that I forwarded to you, the development is on schedule.
FO300019957	CitTalkKnightCaptainDuskResponse1
FO300019958	Hail.
FO300019959	Hail to you.
FO300019960	Carry on.
FO300019961	Good to see you.
FO300019962	Keep moving.
FO300019963	CitTalkDuskKodiak3
FO300019964	Well, the rest of us have work to do.
FO300019965	If only we were all so lucky. I have work to do.
FO300019966	CitTalkDuskKodiak2
FO300019967	Oh, please. I'm ready for anything, at all times. I'm just that awesome. You know that.
FO300019968	You know me, Dusk. I was born ready for anything!
FO300019969	CitTalkDuskKodiak1
FO300019970	For someone who should be preparing for an assault, you seem to have a lot of time to be social.
FO300019971	CitTalkDuskGlade5
FO300019972	A few people. But I don't get tired of hearing it.
FO300019973	All the time, Glade. All the time.
FO300019974	CitTalkDuskGlade4
FO300019975	You're really scary, Dusk. Has anyone ever told you that?
FO300019976	You're a frightening woman, Dusk. Anyone ever tell you that?
FO300019977	CitTalkDuskGlade3
FO300019978	So, I wasn't aiming for his nose. That's what.
FO300019979	CitTalkDuskGlade2
FO300019980	Are you kidding? A couple of inches? So you get the nose instead of the eye. Who cares?
FO300019981	A couple of inches? So you'd have taken out his nose instead of his eye? So what!
FO300019982	CitTalkDuskGlade1
FO300019983	Bullshit. That third shot dropped by a couple of inches.
FO300019984	Yeah, not really. I dropped the fourth shot a couple of inches.
FO300019985	Yes, father. I understand. You have my apologies.
FO300019986	Oh, Sarah. My dear, sweet girl. So eager you are to rush headlong into battle. But no, not now. Not yet. Our time will come, fear not.
FO300019987	You may be a Sentinel, but you're also my daughter. And I won't throw your life away fighting an enemy we know too little about. I'm sorry, but no.
FO300019988	I've been talking with the other members of the Pride. We want to assault the purifier, father! Now! The Enclave must pay for what they've done!
FO300019989	Certainly, Sarah. What's on your mind?
FO300019990	Yes, my daughter? What is it?
FO300019991	CitTalkKnightStarPaladinCrossResponse1
FO300019992	Hail.

FO300020002	Look at this place. Look at me. How do you think I am?
FO300020003	About as good as can be expected.

FO300020027	How're you?
FO300020028	Hey, have you heard any news?
FO300020029	Some people are talking, what have you heard?
FO300020030	I'm starting to get that funny feeling again, have you heard about anything that might be going on?
FO300020031	Hey.
FO300020032	Hello.
FO300020033	Hello.
FO300020034	Hello.
FO300020035	Hi.
FO300020036	Good morning.
FO300020037	Mornin'.
FO300020038	Evenin'. Not that you can really tell down here.
FO300020039	Nice night.
FO300020040	UnderworldTalkCarolGhoulResponse
FO300020041	Oh, don't worry about me. You just go enjoy your drink.
FO300020042	No need to worry about me, dear. You just go enjoy your food.
FO300020043	Oh, don't worry yourself over me. I'm just fine. Go talk to your friends.
FO300020044	I've been better, but I'm fine. No need to worry.
FO300020045	Oh, I'm doing alright, I suppose.
FO300020046	I'm fine, I'm just fine. Thank you for your concern. I'm fine.
FO300020047	UnderworldTalkGhoulAhzurkhalDrinkResponse1
FO300020048	Ehn. It's okay.
FO300020049	It's not bad. Not bad at all.
FO300020050	It's great! This must be that stuff that Quinn brought back.
FO300020051	Each one is better than the last.
FO300020052	It's better than that watered-down piss they pour over at Carol's.
FO300020053	Liquids aren't usually the way I prefer to fly, but it's not bad.
FO300020054	That's a good drink, there's no denying it.
FO300020055	Yes, I am, Mr. Ahzrukhal.
FO300020056	Sorry, I don't mean to pry. It just seems like you should be doing more than this.
FO300020057	Some other jackass should be pulling nighttime guard duty. Maybe I'll go have a little chat with Eulogy about that.
FO300020058	It just seems like you do most of the work around here.
FO300020059	Yeah, so maybe I get a raw deal sometimes. Everybody does out here. That's the way shit goes.
FO300020060	But maybe it's time that changed. Maybe I go see Eulogy about that right now, in fact.
FO300020061	I was just wondering, really. I figure you must make more than the others.
FO300020062	They must pay you really well to put up with this boring job.
FO300020063	Huh?
FO300020064	Yeah, I mean they pay well enough, I guess. What the hell do you care?
FO300020065	I think Eulogy is looking for you.
FO300020066	You think so, do you?
FO300020067	Funny, 'cause I ain't heard nothing about it. So maybe you should just get lost.
FO300020068	Just stopping by to see how things are going. Tired? Need a break?
FO300020069	Since when are we such good buddies? Huh?
FO300020070	I'll tell you what I need. I need you to fuck off.
FO300020071	Man, I hate the graveyard shift.
FO300020072	Penny, come on. You can't save Rory. It's time to save yourself.
FO300020073	Let's just go, okay? I don't want to think about it.
FO300020074	Why are you still in here? It's time to go.
FO300020075	No! I'm not leaving while they've still got Rory locked up!
FO300020076	He's the only person here that's been nice to me. I'm not just going to leave him like that!
FO300020077	Come on, let's go. We need to get you out of here now.
FO300020078	I already told Sammy AND Squirrel I'm not going. I'm not leaving Rory!
FO300020079	What're you gonna do, shoot me?
FO300020080	Maybe I can talk to her. Can you tell me what's going on?
FO300020081	She went all soft on Rory Maclaren. He's this guy that got captured. Not bad for a Mungo, but Penny really likes him.
FO300020082	The guards threw him in the box last week for causing problems. He's still in there, and she won't leave until he's out.
FO300020083	I say he's just another mungo, and ain't our problem. But Penny's being all stupid, like I said.
FO300020084	What the hell is her problem?
FO300020085	Beats me. I don't get girls at ALL.
FO300020086	She's all sweet on Rory Maclaren or something. Says she won't leave while he's still in the box.
FO300020087	What? Why won't she leave?
FO300020088	This mungo, Rory Maclaren. She got all sweet on him or something. I dunno, it's some stupid girl thing.
FO300020089	But they threw him in the box 'cause he was giving them shit, and they won't let him out.
FO300020090	So Penny says she ain't going until she knows he's safe. I told her she's stupid.
FO300020091	I did my part. You're on your own now.
FO300020092	Thanks, I guess. Me and Sammy should be able to make it out of here now.
FO300020093	There's a drain in the bathrooms we can fit through. It's too small for mungos, so they never boarded it up.
FO300020094	But Penny won't leave. I tried to get her to come with us, but she's being all stupid.
FO300020095	I took care of the guard. Is it safe to leave?
FO300020096	Yep, me and Sammy can get out no problem. We're good at sneaking. They'll never spot us.
FO300020097	We can just sneak through the drain in the bathrooms. It's just big enough for us. Way too small for you mungos.
FO300020098	But Penny won't leave. She's being all stupid, and even though we told her it's the only chance to go, she says she's staying.
FO300020099	Okay, the guard's out of the way. Now get moving!
FO300020100	Oh, don't worry. We're outta here. Me and Sammy can make it, no problem. The drain in the bathroom is small; we'll fit through, but mungos can't.
FO300020101	But you gotta tell Penny it's time to go. She's being all dumb, and won't listen to us. You gotta talk to her.
FO300020102	Fine, let's get Rory and get the hell out of here.
FO300020103	I can't. If they see me out there, they'll throw me back in and then I'll never get out. You have to do it.
FO300020104	If you can get Rory out, come and get me and then we can leave. I just won't leave him behind.
FO300020105	Okay, what do you want me to do?
FO300020106	You'll help? Oh, thank you!
FO300020107	You have to get Rory out of the box. He's locked in there, and the guards have the key. I think Forty has one; I don't know where the other is.
FO300020108	Probably the boss guy has it, or it's in his room. You find the key, you can get Rory out, and then I'll leave.
FO300020109	We don't have time for this. We need to leave. Now!
FO300020110	Nuh-uh. Not without Rory.
FO300020111	You gotta get him out of the box. You just gotta! They've got keys for it somewhere. That mungo Forty has one.
FO300020112	I don't know where the other one is. His boss probably has it somewhere. You get Rory out, and I'll leave. Not until then.
FO300020113	Why is this my problem?
FO300020114	Hey, you're the one that said you wanted to get us out of here.
FO300020115	Go talk to her. See if you can get her to come with us. Me and Sammy are getting out of here right now.
FO300020116	We'll wait east of Paradise Falls. Meet us there once Penny's out.
FO300020117	So what do I do?
FO300020118	Hell, I dunno. Go talk to her. Try and get her to get out while she can.
FO300020119	Me and Sammy are getting out of here now, though. If you can get her to come, meet us east of here after you're out.
FO300020120	Oh, dear. Well, I guess the dangers around those old supplies keeps it from being smooth sailing. Otherwise, they'd already have been looted, huh?
FO300020121	Well, keep what you got. Just traded for a big food shipment, myself. Here, take a bit, my treat - the taste kind of grates after a while.
FO300020122	Oh, you poor dear, putting on a brave face like that. Well, don't worry, it'll all be better, and it's for a good cause.
FO300020123	Now, let me take a few notes, and I'll handle that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made rad-cure concoction.
FO300020124	I've never had a chance to test it out on someone so heavily dosed, but I'm sure it'll work out fine. Exciting, isn't it?
FO300020125	Oh, I feel fine! <cough> Never better! <cough> No problem at all! <wheeze>
FO300020126	That's a pretty good way of putting it. I think I'll use that in the book. Maybe I should credit you as a co-author, instead of just a researcher?
FO300020127	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
FO300020128	And looking at this landmine, it gives me an idea. It's a terrible device that does terrible things, of course. But it's easy to make your own, too.
FO300020129	Fast hands and faster wits can get you an awful lot. Including landmines.
FO300020130	Oh dear. All of them? Well, I don't think I could water down the formula any further.
FO300020131	With that much testing, I guess it's beyond correction. Go ahead and keep it. Maybe you can find a nicer use for it, right?
FO300020132	I don't believe this is as non-lethal as you had expected. To put it lightly.
FO300020133	Some of these observations about their armor and camouflage gave me an idea for reinforced, neutral-colored headgear.
FO300020134	Here, consider it thanks for not interfering with them. Oh, speaking of which, take these. So you can continue to avoid them in the future.
FO300020135	They seem mostly independent. I don't think there's any sort of "society" there.
FO300020136	You? At a loss for words? Oh, it's worse than I thought!
FO300020137	Luckily, I'm here to patch you up. Now, hold still and quit fidgeting.
FO300020138	Despite my glossary of expletives, nothing properly sums up this pain.
FO300020139	I guess that's how people are, huh? Show a little initiative and success, and they'll support you enough for real success.
FO300020140	Oh, and I'll let the Rivet City traders know they'll be favorably mentioned in the book. You'll get a discount buying gear from them in the future.
FO300020141	It had success as a science station, and people flock to success.
FO300020142	Hey, robots are people, too! Well, some of them. Kinda.
FO300020143	Well, okay. Not really. Still, just in case you anger a few of our more metallic brethren, have a few pulse grenades I picked up, just in case.
FO300020144	Like a charm. I only wish it were always that easy to manipulate people.
FO300020145	Well, we won't let that sort of information be held hostage, will we? We'll educate the world with our book!
FO300020146	Oh, and here's a book of mine and some caps for your research. Think of it as pay for a civilization worth of overdue books.
FO300020147	The place was a death trap. But I got in and out as quick as I could.
FO300020148	Basic Sly Response
FO300020149	Oh my, Raiders had set up camp there? I'm guessing you didn't just negotiate with them, did you?
FO300020150	Those big, shadowy stores can be great for hiding out.
FO300020151	That's a terrible joke. I love it! Good to see you're still in such good spirits!
FO300020152	Now, let me take a few notes, and I'll handle that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made rad-cure concoction.
FO300020153	I like to think of it as adding to my glowing personality.
FO300020154	Oh, of course. Can't let little things like flying shrapnel slow you down, now can you?
FO300020155	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
FO300020156	I've got the grace of a cat. No landmine's going to stop me.
FO300020157	Oh, that isn't what I want at all. People already have all sorts of ways to kill them. We don't need a more lethal Mole Rat trap. Just a better one.
FO300020158	I guess it's back to the drawing board for that repellent. I wonder if I can make it into some sort of fuel. Anyway, I'll just take that.
FO300020159	Hrm. Well, I knew that. But I guess it does raise the question of whether or not they have a language. Maybe I should study that later.
FO300020160	I wish we could have gotten more information, but this'll have to do for the book. Here's your pay. Maybe they'll help you be sneakier next time.
FO300020161	They're savages with big claws and absolutely no interest in small talk.
FO300020162	Don't think too hard about it. No fair dying on me just because you want your last words to be especially memorable!
FO300020163	Well, rest easy and I'll see about fixing you up once I take a few notes.
FO300020164	Pardon me if I bleed profusely while thinking how best to describe this pain.
FO300020165	Oh well. Still, for your help, have a few of these. They may help out next time you need to talk to a few folks.
FO300020166	I suppose it wouldn't hurt to add a nice story to it. And it'd be a nice little reward for your hard work to include you as a hero.
FO300020167	None of them agree on a story. So let's just say I set the whole place up.
FO300020168	Oh, I don't know about that. But I guess you do. And it's a good enough example for the book, I suppose.
FO300020169	It helps to have the right tool for the job. Failing that, go with the right tool to cheat at the job. Like a pulse grenade. Here, have a couple.
FO300020170	Make the right connection, and robots do what you want. Just like people.
FO300020171	Well, maybe the Raiders will try reading a few of the books. Maybe it'll open their eyes to a few things.
FO300020172	Still, it's good to know it's standing. Maybe I'll inspire someone to take care of the place. Have some caps as payment for that little bit of hope.
FO300020173	Oh, it's still there, but it's full of Raiders. The place is a death trap.
FO300020174	I'm taking a break from the research.
FO300020175	Don't take to long. The sooner the book's done, the more people we can save with it!
FO300020176	Well, okay. If you feel you really need one.
FO300020177	Feel free! Gotta have my super researcher in tip-top condition to work, right?
FO300020178	Well, I can't force you to work, I suppose.
FO300020179	You know, you're right. I don't.
FO300020180	See, I knew it. I'm really just a boring old Ghoul, I promise.
FO300020181	No, Carol. I'd love to hear your story.
FO300020182	I was born in 2051, so yes, that makes me a pre-war Ghoul.
FO300020183	How did you end up here?
FO300020184	Oh, that's such a long story. You couldn't possibly want to hear about that.
FO300020185	Not going to talk about it. Don't ask.
FO300020186	Not your business.
FO300020187	Just show me the goods.
FO300020188	Why do you bother to hide what you sell?
FO300020189	While there is no law in Underworld, per se, I'd rather not end up at the receiving end of an angry lynch mob.
FO300020190	There is no shortage of do-gooders around here and it would be just like them to take it upon themselves to interfere in a fair business transaction.
FO300020191	Honestly. I have something to sell, and you want to buy it, now why is that anyone else' business? Hrm?
FO300020192	Just show me the goods.
FO300020193	Why do you bother to hide what you sell?
FO300020194	While there is no law in Underworld, per se, I'd rather not end up at the receiving end of an angry lynch mob.
FO300020195	There is no shortage of do-gooders around here and it would be just like them to take it upon themselves to interfere in a fair business transaction.
FO300020196	Honestly. I have something to sell, and you want to buy it, now why is that anyone else's business? Hrm?
FO300020197	Oh, now now now, don't be hasty. I'm sure that we can work out a compromise. Here, step this way and let me show you what I have.
FO300020198	Look at these people. They're Jetting. Trust me, I know.
FO300020199	Simply step over here, my friend and I'll show you my stock of more... potent goods.
FO300020200	Let me see the real goods.
FO300020201	Why, whatever do you mean? I am a simple barkeep, nothing more.
FO300020202	Certainly, my friend.
FO300020203	I must ask that you speak to no one about our transactions.
FO300020204	Let's talk about something else.
FO300020205	Very well. You ask too many questions as it is.
FO300020206	What does he do for you?
FO300020207	Watches over the bar. Keeps the drunks in line. Pretty much, I point at something and Charon hurts it.
FO300020208	He's the best thug a corrupt bartender could ever ask for. He never bothers me with his own annoying sense of morality.
FO300020209	He's a loyal employee? What do you mean?
FO300020210	I hold his contract, which makes me his employer. He will do what I ask when I ask, without question.
FO300020211	He is absolutely loyal to whomever holds his contract. Unfailing, unflinching, until the day that employment ends.
FO300020212	Don't get me wrong, I have no doubt that he holds no end of animosity towards me. But so long as he is my employee, he is as gentle as a teddy bear.
FO300020213	He doesn't say much, does he?
FO300020214	His company is rather refreshing, isn't it? But don't mistake his brevity for stupidity. That would be very unwise.
FO300020215	Underestimating an opponent has been the last mistake of far too many individuals throughout history.
FO300020216	So he's your slave?
FO300020217	No, he is not. Sir, you insult me. I do not believe in slavery. It is an abomination.
FO300020218	I am a firm believer in personal choice. To force another person into bondage is unthinkable. Chains are earned, never forced.
FO300020219	Charon made some choices that landed him in my employ. The matters of our contract is between him and I -- no one else.
FO300020220	No he is not. Ma'am, you insult me. I do not believe in slavery. It is an abomination.
FO300020221	I am a firm believer in personal choice. To force another person into bondage is unthinkable. Chains are earned, never forced.
FO300020222	Charon made some choices that landed him in my employ. The matters of our contract is between him and I -- no one else.
FO300020223	What can you tell me about yourself?
FO300020224	Not much to say really. Dave was my husband for many, many years.
FO300020225	Not much to say really. I'm Dave's wife, or first wife I guess. I've lived here for many years now.
FO300020226	Years ago, I freed these poor people from the wrath of Tom, former monarch of the Kingdom of Tom.
FO300020227	Afterwards, the people naturally elected me as their president, and the Republic of Dave was formed.
FO300020228	I'd be interested in learning more about you, Mister President.
FO300020229	All I have to say is Dave is my husband. Mine, do you understand? I don't care what Rosie has to say about it.
FO300020230	Just because Rosie used to be this big leader out in the Wasteland, she thinks she's better than me. She even ordered Dave around once!
FO300020231	Could you tell me more about yourself, Jessica?
FO300020232	All you need to know is that I'm second-in-command next to Dave, so don't bother me.
FO300020233	And don't talk to Rosie or Jessica either. Those are Dave's wives and they have work they need to do.
FO300020234	Tell me about yourself.
FO300020235	I'm gonna be president when I grow up!
FO300020236	So what have you been up to, kid?
FO300020237	Dave's my daddy! He's the bestest daddy ever!
FO300020238	So, what have you been up to, kid?
FO300020239	I like to play with the toys in the museum, but Shawna always yells at me.
FO300020240	So, what have you been up to, kid?
FO300020241	President Daddy says I sleep too much, but I don't sleep much at all!
FO300020242	So, what have you been up to, kid?
FO300020243	RDPlayTalk
FO300020244	Leave me alone, Flower. I'm thinking.
FO300020245	Can't you see I'm doing important things?
FO300020246	For crying out loud, Flower, I'm busy.
FO300020247	Fine, in a little bit. Geez.
FO300020248	Can't right now. Why don't you ask Mary?
FO300020249	I bet Ralph isn't doing anything, why don't you ask him?
FO300020250	Sorry, kiddo, I'm too busy right now.
FO300020251	Why don't you ask Rachael if she can play?
FO300020252	If you don't leave, Penny won't leave. She'll be killed. Is that what you want?
FO300020253	Just make sure you take care of her. I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to her, or her friends.
FO300020254	So what do we do now?
FO300020255	I need you out of here now, so I can get Penny out.
FO300020256	Okay, fine. If it'll help Penny, I'll do it. What do you want me to do?
FO300020257	I came for the kids. Penny wanted you free, so here we are.
FO300020258	Penny? She wanted you to set me free?
FO300020259	I owe that little girl a lot. I'll have to try and make it up to her someday.
FO300020260	Okay, what do we do?
FO300020261	You're on your own, pal. I've got more important things to do.
FO300020262	That's it, huh? Just toss me out of the box and into the meat grinder?
FO300020263	Thanks for nothing, asshole.
FO300020264	We'll have to run for it.
FO300020265	Okay, if you say so. I'll be right behind you. If you can get me to the front gate, I can take it from there.
FO300020266	We need to be careful. Stay low and stay quiet.
FO300020267	You got it. I'll stay right with you. Get me to the front gate, and I can make a run for it from there.
FO300020268	You want to get out of here, or you want to waste time asking questions?
FO300020269	Fine, fine. Let's go. What's the plan?
FO300020270	There's no time for explanations. We've got to move!
FO300020271	Look, I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. For all I know, you're just trying to trick me into another beating.
FO300020272	Penny asked me to get you out of here.
FO300020273	She did? Is she safe? Can I see her?
FO300020274	I'm the guy who's going to kill you if you don't get moving.
FO300020275	What? What's going on? Who are you?
FO300020276	What? What's going on? Who are you?
FO300020277	I'm the girl who's going to kill you if you don't get moving.
FO300020278	No time to talk. We've got to move, right now.
FO300020279	Where are we going? What's going on? Who the hell ARE you?
FO300020280	I'm here to set you free.
FO300020281	What? Are you kidding me? This is another one of Forty's tricks, isn't it. Well I'm not falling for it.
FO300020282	Spy on what?  Your trailer-home?
FO300020283	If the Capitol Building does not meet your incredible standards, feel free to escort yourself out.  In fact, just leave now.
FO300020284	Never mind.
FO300020285	Okay. Let's get the hell out of here.
FO300020286	Let's go.
FO300020287	Right behind you.
FO300020288	Wait here.
FO300020289	Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
FO300020290	That'll save a lot of time and effort. Oh, and blood, on your part. A real-world example might help more, but I won't turn down the help!
FO300020291	Why get myself hurt? I'm a good enough doctor to explain this part for you.
FO300020292	Oh, but nothing beats a real-world example. And I have a new rad treatment I was just itching to try out on a live subject!
FO300020293	But I guess you're right, and at least it keeps you safe and sound for later testing. Here's some spare chems for your help.
FO300020294	Fear not! With my vast scientific knowledge, I explain this one myself.
FO300020295	There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground, and swallows circling with their shimmering sound
FO300020296	And frogs in the pool singing at night, And wild plum trees in tremulous white
FO300020297	Robins will wear their feathery fire, Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; And not one will know of the war, not one
FO300020298	Will care at last when it is done. Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, If mankind perished utterly;
FO300020299	And Spring herself when she woke at dawn would scarcely know that we were gone.

FO300020307	<whistle> Here Doggy, Doggy.
FO300020308	Time for your walk, family pet.
FO300020309	See, and you said you weren't interesting.
FO300020310	You tell the same stories for 200 years, you'll feel pretty uninteresting too.
FO300020311	So, how did you end up as a Ghoul?
FO300020312	I don't know how it happens. Doctor Barrows says it was radiation. All I know is that people kept showing up here in the museum.
FO300020313	After things calmed down above ground, we tried to live down here as best we could. After a while, things got strange.
FO300020314	My skin started to get dry and flake off. Everyone's did. It took a while, months, maybe a year. But sooner or later, everyone ended up like this.
FO300020315	Some of them went crazy. Some of us just accepted it. After a while, other Ghouls would find their way in here and Underworld just sort of grew.
FO300020316	No one bothered us down here, and we were happy enough to leave them alone. And once my Greta showed up, it was a good enough life for me.
FO300020317	What was the Wasteland like after the war?
FO300020318	But I could hear what was happening above. People howling like animals. Chaos. Looting, killing, it's like every foul thing inside of them came out.
FO300020319	Do you remember the day the war started?
FO300020320	I was just a little girl then. We couldn't afford a space in one of the Vaults. I remember filing down into that shelter, my father rushing me in.
FO300020321	MS03TaskLie
FO300020322	There's no way you could have gone there and gotten back already.
FO300020323	It's got to take at least a day to get there and back. Now get going!
FO300020324	I went into Minefield and came back, no problem. <Lie.>
FO300020325	I appreciate the landmine, but there's just no way you could have gotten to Minefield and back already!
FO300020326	I mean, it's got to take at least a day or so to get there and back! So get going!
FO300020327	I got through Minefield alive, and I even brought you a present. <Lie.>
FO300020328	Oh, great! And you look like it went fine! So, how was it?
FO300020329	I got through Minefield alive, and I even brought you a present. <Lie.>
FO300020330	My very own landmine! Just what I've always wanted. Well, always since I sent you out on this, anyway.
FO300020331	Now, tell me all about it. What was it like going through there? What's it like disarming a landmine?
FO300020332	I got through Minefield alive, and I even brought you a present. <Lie.>
FO300020333	Do you think I suddenly lost track of time or something? There's no way you've gone there and back in the blink of an eye like that!
FO300020334	I checked out the Super-Duper Mart, but nothing's there. <Lie.>
FO300020335	Really? Oh, that's a shame. I guess it was an obvious place for people to get food, so it all got taken long ago, huh?
FO300020336	Still, good work checking it out! And have some food as thanks for the work. It's a shame you didn't find any, there.
FO300020337	I checked out the Super-Duper Mart, but nothing's there. <Lie.>
FO300020338	Oh, come on. You barely even left! I can't imagine you tested it on reasonable number of subjects so quickly. It can't have been a good sample size.
FO300020339	I tested it out, and it works just fine. <Lie.>
FO300020340	Excellent! Finally, mankind will have a way to shoo away those annoying pests without resorting to cruelty or violence!
FO300020341	I'll just take that back for my final studies. Oh, but here! I've got lots of leftover chems from the testing. Maybe some of them are your style?
FO300020342	I tested it out, and it works just fine. <Lie.>
FO300020343	Oh, come on! You weren't even searching for a full day! You can't just give up on knowledge like that so fast!
FO300020344	I went to the site of the library, but the building was destroyed. <Lie.>
FO300020345	Really? All of it? Not even a single, tattered paperback? Oh, that's terrible. Just like the Library of Alexandria County. What a loss to the world.
FO300020346	I went to the site of the library, but the building was destroyed. <Lie.>
FO300020347	Oh, come on. Now you're just being silly. There's no way you went down to Rivet City and came back in less than a day.
FO300020348	Rivet City is actually the remains of an ancient, underwater civilization. <Lie.>
FO300020349	Oh my goodness! Do you think it's originally from Atlantis? Or maybe Mu? Maybe they started the war? I never would have guessed that without you!
FO300020350	Rivet City is actually the remains of an ancient, underwater civilization. <Lie.>
FO300020351	As far as I can tell, you're a perfectly healthy 16-year-old boy. So yes, you have to go to class to take your G.O.A.T. exam!
FO300020352	As far as I can tell, you're a perfectly healthy 16-year-old girl. So yes, you have to go to class to take your G.O.A.T. exam!
FO300020353	All right, all right. Just keep quiet.
FO300020354	Come on, Forty. Let's go take a break.
FO300020355	Yeah, he might. Except he ain't gonna know nothing about it. Come on, I see the way you look at me. I can really give you something to look at.
FO300020356	That's a pretty stupid idea, even for you. Eulogy'd kill us both.
FO300020357	Oh, nothing. I was just sitting around, all bored and anxious, and thinking maybe I could find something to do. I mean, maybe we could.
FO300020358	The hell you want, Crimson?
FO300020359	Hey there, sugar. Lonely night?
FO300020360	Forget it.
FO300020361	Already forgotten. Now take a hike.
FO300020362	You don't think he's a good-looking guy? I bet he could show you a good time.
FO300020363	Maybe I'll go see how he's doing. Maybe there's something I could do for him.
FO300020364	You ain't gonna say a word 'bout this, right?
FO300020365	There's 100 caps in it for you.
FO300020366	Oh yeah?
FO300020367	Now that I think about it, Forty has been lookin' mighty fine lately. Workin' out extra.
FO300020368	Maybe I'll go see if there's anything I can do for him. You keep this between me and you. Clear?
FO300020369	I think Forty could use some company.
FO300020370	Uh-huh. And what makes you think I give two shits about what Forty could use?
FO300020371	I've had enough "problems" for one day, thanks.
FO300020372	You and me both.
FO300020373	Let me patch her through. She can explain what's gone wrong.
FO300020374	You've got to be kidding me. What now?
FO300020375	Let me patch her through. She can explain it to you.
FO300020376	What kind of problem?
FO300020377	Let me patch her through. She can explain it better than I could.
FO300020378	Isn't there another way to get you out?
FO300020379	You're really dumb, aren't you?
FO300020380	I just told you this is the plan. I don't got another way to do this.
FO300020381	Your plan is crazy. I'm not doing it.
FO300020382	Great. Then that means we're still stuck in here, and you're an asshole.
FO300020383	Sure thing, Mr. Brotch.
FO300020384	Well, now that everyone has managed to find the classroom, we can finally get started.
FO300020385	No talking, and keep your eyes to yourselves.
FO300020386	Yes, I'm talking to you Mr. DeLoria!
FO300020387	Unless anyone else has an insightful comment, let's get started.
FO300020388	Question 1. A frenzied vault scientist runs up to you and yells, "I'm going to put my quantum harmonizer in your photonic resonation chamber!"
FO300020389	What's your response?
FO300020390	Question 2. While working as an intern in the clinic, a patient with a strange infection in his foot stumbles through the door.
FO300020391	The infection is spreading at an alarming rate, but the doctor has stepped out for a while. What do you do?
FO300020392	Question 3. You discover a young boy lost in the lower levels of the vault.
FO300020393	He’s hungry and frightened, but also appears to be in possession of stolen property. What do you do?
FO300020394	Question 4. Congratulations! You’ve made one of the Vault 101 baseball teams. Which position do you prefer?
FO300020395	Question 5. Your grandmother invites you to tea, but you’re surprised when she gives you a pistol, and orders you to kill another vault resident.
FO300020396	What do you do?
FO300020397	Question 6. Old Mister Abernathy has locked himself in his quarters again, and you’ve been ordered to get him out. How do you proceed?
FO300020398	Question 7. Oh no! You’ve been exposed to radiation, and a mutated hand has grown out of your stomach! What’s the best course of treatment?
FO300020399	Question 8. A fellow Vault 101 resident is in possession of a Grognak the Barbarian comic book, issue number 1. You want it.
FO300020400	What's the best way to obtain it?
FO300020401	Question 10. Who is, indisputably, the most important person in Vault 101:
FO300020402	He who shelters us from the harshness of the atomic Wasteland, and to whom we owe everything we have, including our lives?
FO300020403	Pencils down, people. That's it. The infamous G.O.A.T.!
FO300020404	I'm sure most of you didn't find it so bad. Others, well, there are always openings in the maintenance department.
FO300020405	Don't forget to hand in your tests before you leave. You don't want to know what happens to people who "fail" the G.O.A.T.
FO300020406	You can have the rest of the day off, to celebrate or to pray, as the situation warrants.
FO300020407	I'll see you tomorrow, bright and early.
FO300020408	Okay, if you say so. I'm getting out of here, then.
FO300020409	You go out the normal way, so they don't get suspicious. Meet us outside.
FO300020410	Yes, he's safe. Now get moving!
FO300020411	Okay, okay!
FO300020412	Don't follow me. You go out the normal way, and meet Sammy and me outside.
FO300020413	I got him out, all right. Now it's your turn.
FO300020414	You saved him? Really?
FO300020415	Thank you so much. I'll make it up to you somehow, I promise.
FO300020416	Now I have to get out. Don't follow me; you go out the normal way. We'll meet outside.
FO300020417	I tried, but he didn't make it.
FO300020418	I'm getting out of here. Don't follow me.
FO300020419	You're damn right I do!
FO300020420	Now you sound like a merc! Well, let's cut the bullshit and get right to it then.
FO300020421	So, for your reward, what'll it be? The Ranger Battlearmor or one of Brick's Miniguns?
FO300020422	Are you kidding me? Hell would have been a damn picnic!
FO300020423	All right, all right. No need to get your underpants in a knot.
FO300020424	Can you give me a full debriefing on what happened out there with my men?
FO300020425	No games. You tell me where my father is. Now, you little brat.
FO300020426	Oh, don't be mean. That's not a good way to start.
FO300020427	I said we're going to play a game, so that's what we're going to do.
FO300020428	Who else lived in Grayditch?
FO300020429	Ummm, besides me and my pappa, there was Doc Lesko who stayed with us and Will Brandice and his momma and pappa too.
FO300020430	Did you hear anyone mention anything about an Ant Queen?
FO300020431	Something about "laying eggs" whatever that means.
FO300020432	He said the queen would never be above ground. That he'd have to find her. Weird huh?
FO300020433	That can't be right! The stupid test got it all wrong!
FO300020434	Listen, I was just as obnoxious at your age. I didn't take the G.O.A.T. seriously and look where I ended up.
FO300020435	Just between you and me? The whole test is a joke.
FO300020436	If you don't like the results, I can make your G.O.A.T. come out any way you want. Just let me know.
FO300020437	Whatever. I just answered randomly. Is that how you got stuck with your job?
FO300020438	Ha. Closer to reality than you might think.
FO300020439	Listen, I was just as obnoxious at your age. I didn't take the G.O.A.T. seriously and look where I ended up.
FO300020440	Just between you and me? The whole test is a joke.
FO300020441	If you don't like the results, I can make your G.O.A.T. come out any way you want. Just let me know.
FO300020442	Wow! That's what I've always wanted to be. My dreams are finally coming true!
FO300020443	Yes, um, it's refreshing to see such, ah, youthful enthusiasm.
FO300020444	Well, I'm glad things turned out so well for you. I hope your classmates find their results half as satisfying.
FO300020445	Hannibal is upstairs somewhere. I'm locking the door behind you, so don't try anything. I'm watching you.
FO300020446	You know your way around. Just try and stay out of trouble.
FO300020447	Stay away from the steps. They have orders to shoot first and loot the body afterward.
FO300020448	Well? Find them! The person you're looking for can perform facial reconstruction or a sophisticated computer memory transfer.
FO300020449	Go on! Shake a leg!
FO300020450	The person who did the surgery and reprogramming is here at Rivet City!
FO300020451	Find this Pinkerton! Learn everything they know! I want that damned android, and I want him now!
FO300020452	His memory transfer was done by a tech named Pinkerton. Here at Rivet City!
FO300020453	Good job! You've confirmed what I suspected all along.
FO300020454	Now, why don't you go out and figure out WHO did the memory work!
FO300020455	Sounds like the android was definitely given new memories.
FO300020456	A Circuit Neuralizer? Here in the Wasteland? How'd they manage to get their grubby hands on one of those? Impressive.
FO300020457	You are showing signs of intelligence and resourcefulness. You might turn out useful after all. But you're wasting time talking to me.
FO300020458	I'm tracking down leads on a Circuit Neuralizer.
FO300020459	Yes well, there are reasons we don't want our technology leaking into the Wasteland. Which is why I've asked you to retrieve it.
FO300020460	Which is what you should be doing right now! The longer you wait, the colder the trail becomes.
FO300020461	MS08AndroidLeads
FO300020462	Excellent! Find this Pinkerton and "interview" him. He may very well know the android's whereabouts.
FO300020463	Well? Go!
FO300020464	His face job was done here, at Rivet City! By someone named Pinkerton!
FO300020465	You are making progress, certainly, but you've got nothing more to learn from me. Get back out there!
FO300020466	Someone got their hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
FO300020467	Well? Why are you still standing there?
FO300020468	I'm tracking down the location and equipment used to perform the face job.
FO300020469	Rumors? That's all you have to offer me? I expect something more concrete! Now get out of my sight!
FO300020470	I've heard rumors about an android looking for special surgery.
FO300020471	Do you know who did the memory swap on the Commonwealth android?
FO300020472	I sure do! No one believes me though. It was old Pinkerton. You know, the "ghost" of Rivet City. He's a genius!
FO300020473	That Commonwealth robot was real! I have proof. Listen to this!
FO300020474	Boss! Don't worry, I'm coming!
FO300020475	This way, Argyle! Into the caves! It's our only chance! (sound of running)
FO300020476	Citizens of Rockopolis! Destroy these interlopers!
FO300020477	Warm welcome's over boss! Time to scram!
FO300020478	Dashwwwooooddd!
FO300020479	Inspired you to tighten your defenses?
FO300020480	Slavers? You led the Slavers here? To Rockopolis? You idiots! Do you realize what you've done!
FO300020481	She's the least of your worries, Craggy. In a few seconds, the Slavers are gonna be breaking down your rocky front door!
FO300020482	Oh magnificent King Crag, fearless leader of Rockopolis! It's me, Daring! Daring Dashwood?
FO300020483	What is the meaning of this?!
FO300020484	Ah, I always knew this broad was heartless. Get it, boss? Heartless?
FO300020485	Aggghhhh!
FO300020486	Fine. What the hell do I call you anyway? Herbert or Bob?
FO300020487	But I'm still in here too, what's left of me. The name's Harold.
FO300020488	But I'm still in here too, what's left of me. The name's Harold.
FO300020489	Well, goodbye for now then, Herbert. Or was it Bob?
FO300020490	But I'm still in here too, what's left of me. The name's Harold.
FO300020491	Can I have some time to think about it?
FO300020492	Of all the Wastelanders I had to bump into it has to be one with a conscience.
FO300020493	Let's keep it an open invitation then. I don't want to wait until the next person visits, it could be years.
FO300020494	Just think about it, okay?
FO300020495	Ok, I'll do it.
FO300020496	You will? Oh! You've made us so happy! Isn't that right Bob?
FO300020497	Just give me a little time to say goodbye to good old Bob and then I'll be ready.
FO300020498	Okay then. Hey, you haven't seen the Doc's kid, have you? We're still looking for him.
FO300020499	Okay then. Hey, you haven't seen the Doc's kid, have you? We're still looking for her.
FO300020500	No, sir. Good luck with your search though.
FO300020501	Whatever. Get back in your room.
FO300020502	I've got bigger problems right now than dealing with your lush of a mother again.
FO300020503	No, wait! You're looking for the Doc's kid, right? He was just here! I saw where he went.
FO300020504	No, wait! You're looking for the Doc's kid, right? He was just here! I saw where he went.
FO300020505	You saw him? Where'd he go?
FO300020506	You saw her? Where'd she go?
FO300020507	Uh uh. You go in there and help my mom. Then I'll tell you.
FO300020508	Listen you little punk! We just beat a man to death. You want to be next?
FO300020509	No sir! Uh, he went that way! I saw him. I did!
FO300020510	No sir! Uh, she went that way! I saw her. I did!
FO300020511	That's better. Now get in your goddamn room!
FO300020512	No, please! Don't leave! You've got to help my mom!
FO300020513	Goddammit Butch, I told you to get back in your room.
FO300020514	What are you doing out of your room? There's a curfew in effect.
FO300020515	There's roaches in there, Officer Kendall! They're attacking my mom! You've got to help!
FO300020516	I told you, there's roaches in there attacking my mom! You've got to help her!
FO300020517	Oh, uh, sorry Officer. I'll go right back inside.
FO300020518	What's the matter, she dead drunk again? I don't have time for this. Stop being such a sissy and go help her yourself.
FO300020519	CG04ButchSpeech
FO300020520	Over here! Officer Kendall!
FO300020521	Hey! He's right over here! Come quick!
FO300020522	Hey! She's right over here! Come quick!
FO300020523	I've found him! This way!
FO300020524	I've found her! This way!
FO300020525	Officer Kendall! Help!
FO300020526	People die all the time out here. Get used to it.
FO300020527	Why does everyone who comes through here have to be so mean!?
FO300020528	We have to get back at these things for killing my pappa! We just gotta!
FO300020529	No! There is no way my guys are dead!
FO300020530	If there's even the slimmest chance of surviving, they'll do it.
FO300020531	If you won't go, stop wasting my fucking time and find me someone who will!
FO300020532	Why don't you attempt a rescue? Your legs broken or something?
FO300020533	Are you completely stupid?
FO300020534	I can barely walk right now, let alone climb a skyscraper. If I could even hold a pistol, I would go get my guys right now!
FO300020535	I'm using everything I've got just standing here talking to you. Get the point?
FO300020536	You look terrible. Maybe I shouldn't have woken you up so quickly.
FO300020537	Heh, I feel worse than I look, but that doesn't even matter to me. I'm just worried about the rest of the Rangers.
FO300020538	I don't even know if they're still alive.
FO300020539	Do you think Reilly will be okay?
FO300020540	She's a very lucky young lady not to have suffered damage from her coma.
FO300020541	She'll be just fine as long as she takes it easy.
FO300020542	If you revive her, I can find out what happened. Maybe even help her!
FO300020543	Very well. This is against my better judgment, but so be it.
FO300020544	I just hope she has the strength to cope with the system shock.
FO300020545	Forget it!
FO300020546	Now, there's no call to be rude.
FO300020547	I'm just doing my job which is making sure this young lady suffers no more permanent damage.
FO300020548	Now, if you'll excuse me, I have my work to attend to.
FO300020549	Please, Doc! She obviously needs someone's help.
FO300020550	I appreciate your sincerity, but I'm afraid it's just too risky.
FO300020551	Hmph. I thought Ghouls hated humans.
FO300020552	Humans have too many misconceptions. Some of us don't get along with humans, but the majority of us are learning to live with our differences.
FO300020553	Anyway, I am taking too much time speaking with you when I should be working. If you need anything, let me know.
FO300020554	It's nice that you care so much.
FO300020555	I don't share the philosophy that Ghouls and humans are different. We were all the same once.
FO300020556	So why should I treat Reilly any worse than a Ghoul who comes here looking for help?
FO300020557	Anyway, I must get back to my duties. If you need anything else, please let me know.
FO300020558	A Ghoul that wants to be human? That's a good one!
FO300020559	Well, I've never been so insulted! I expected a little more from you, but I see you humans are almost all alike!
FO300020560	Don't worry about Reilly, we'll take care of her. Now, if you'll excuse me.
FO300020561	Interesting.
FO300020562	Not impressed, huh? Oh well. I didn't expect a human to understand the gravity of this experiment anyway.
FO300020563	Just do me a favor, and don't mention this to anyone. No telling what reaction this could have if it got out.
FO300020564	Amazing! Do you think it will really work?
FO300020565	Well, we're trying not to get too excited. Not only because we want to keep it quiet, but also because the experiments look so promising.
FO300020566	For now, just please try and keep what I've told you quiet. No telling what reaction this could have if it got out.
FO300020567	What exactly is the doctor trying to do? You can tell me.
FO300020568	He's trying to come up with a cure. A way to stop the human to Ghoul transition. Perhaps even one day to reverse it!
FO300020569	Why not?
FO300020570	Well, some of the Ghouls in Underworld object to what the Doctor is doing.
FO300020571	They think Ghouls are Ghouls and humans are humans. Like we were meant to be this way.
FO300020572	Some have even threatened the doctor. I'm afraid one day something might happen to him.
FO300020573	Has he met with any success?
FO300020574	So far, none of his conclusions are finalized, but the tests he's running are coming up quite positive!
FO300020575	He's experimenting on her? That's twisted!
FO300020576	First and foremost on Doctor Barrow's mind is her health and well-being. I can assure you of that.
FO300020577	So far, none of his conclusions are finalized, but the tests he's running are coming up quite positive!
FO300020578	You seem to be taking very good care of her.
FO300020579	Well, she's very important to Doctor Barrows and she's my patient.
FO300020580	I don't care if she's human or Ghoul, she gets treated the same here.
FO300020581	Why does Doctor Barrows care so much about humans, anyway?
FO300020582	When Reilly was brought in here he saw a chance to put that theory to the test.
FO300020583	What can you tell me about Reilly?
FO300020584	Poor girl. I didn't think she'd make it through the first night she was brought in here.
FO300020585	Doctor Barrows has done everything in his power to keep her alive.
FO300020586	The code is 7-0-4.
FO300020587	Very well. We'll just verify that now.
FO300020588	The code is 2-1-6.
FO300020589	Let's just make sure you're telling the truth.
FO300020590	I don't know what the code is.
FO300020591	You LIE!
FO300020592	Okay, okay. Just don't hurt me.
FO300020593	I'm waiting.
FO300020594	Why do you want this code so badly?
FO300020595	You know why. We can't start the purifier without it. The longer the purifier isn't running, the more people suffer.
FO300020596	Now I'm running out of patience, son. I want that code, and I want it now.
FO300020597	What code? What are you talking about?
FO300020598	Don't try and play stupid now. It's too late for that; we both know better.
FO300020599	The code to activate the water purifier. Now.
FO300020600	No, seriously. Fuck you.
FO300020601	Why do you insist on provoking me?
FO300020602	Tell me the code NOW.
FO300020603	Fuck you. I'm not telling you anything.
FO300020604	I'll be honest. I'm running out of patience here, and I'm not looking to play games with you.
FO300020605	You tell me that code, or it's going to cost you.
FO300020606	You killed my father, you son of a bitch!
FO300020607	Technically, your father killed himself. His loyalties lay with the wrong people, and he paid the price.
FO300020608	You, on the other hand, have an opportunity to learn from his mistakes.
FO300020609	This is some kind of mistake. You've got the wrong person.
FO300020610	You really think I'm that stupid? I know you were there. I saw you.
FO300020611	You're in a heap of trouble, kid. You're a traitor to the United States government. You know what happens to traitors, don't you?
FO300020612	You give me that code, and maybe we can work out a deal for you. But you need to start talking right now.
FO300020613	What the hell is going on here?
FO300020614	I'll tell you what's going on here. You lost.
FO300020615	The good guys won this one, and now we're just wrapping up loose ends. We've got the purifier, now we just need the code to start it.
FO300020616	You're going to give me that code now, and save us all a lot of trouble. Maybe I'll even let you go. So how about it?
FO300020617	I'll tell you whatever you want. Please just don't hurt me.
FO300020618	Now that's just what I wanted to hear.
FO300020619	So what's the code?
FO300020620	Let me out of here. Now!
FO300020621	IF you tell me the code, it might be worth your life. But you're really not in a position to be demanding anything, are you?
FO300020622	Negative, Sir. The code's no good. I just lost another man.
FO300020623	Copy 7-0-4. Standby, sir. Entering code now.
FO300020624	Your code is 7-0-4. Repeat, 7-0-4. Confirm and enter.
FO300020625	Affirmative, sir. Standing by for code transmission.
FO300020626	This is Colonel Autumn. Are your men in place, soldier?
FO300020627	Confirm, that's the correct code. Systems coming online now, sir. I'll have a full report shortly.
FO300020628	Copy 2-1-6. Standby, sir. Entering code now.
FO300020629	Your code is 2-1-6. Repeat, 2-1-6. Confirm and enter.
FO300020630	Affirmative, sir. Standing by for code transmission.
FO300020631	This is Colonel Autumn. Are your men in place, soldier?
FO300020632	And I'll unlock your restraints as well. I'll be waiting for you in my office. Please don't tarry.
FO300020633	You'll find your possessions in the locker near the door. I'll unlock the way for you.
FO300020634	I'd like to have a word with you, face-to-face. I think there are a few things you and I should discuss.
FO300020635	I have no doubt that you know who I am. I'm sure you've heard my radio broadcasts.
FO300020636	I do apologize for Colonel Autumn's attitude. He's been under a great deal of stress lately.
FO300020637	Ah, alone at last.
FO300020638	Yes sir.
FO300020639	Mr. President, I have no time for other matters. I'll be with you shortly.
FO300020640	I should have killed you right away. We have the G.E.C.K., we'll get the code. We don't need you.
FO300020641	Did you really think we would fall for that? I have had ENOUGH of your games.
FO300020642	Thank you for cooperating. I'm afraid we no longer have need of your services.
FO300020643	Wait here.
FO300020644	Fine, but what am I supposed to do here? Work on my needlepoint or something?
FO300020645	I shall wait here until you return for me.
FO300020646	But it's so boring all alone!
FO300020647	Don't piss around, I don't want to be standing here with my thumb up my ass all day.
FO300020648	I will keep this location secure!
FO300020649	I shall reflect on the battles past and the battles to come until your return.
FO300020650	Let's trade equipment.
FO300020651	If this means more stuff for Butch, I'm all for it.
FO300020652	Very well.
FO300020653	You're always welcome to take whatever you want, lover.
FO300020654	Sure, gimme whatever you got.
FO300020655	Yes, by all means, let's.
FO300020656	RL-3 comes equipped with everything a good soldier needs! But your RL-3 can assist in carrying equipment, if needed.
FO300020657	I want to access your storage module.
FO300020658	In the words of Elder Theis: "A Brother well equipped is a Brother keeping to his duty."
FO300020659	Enough about tactics.
FO300020660	If you are through giving orders, then let us move on.
FO300020661	Yeah. Less talking about killing. More killing!
FO300020662	It is always a subject worthy of discussion.
FO300020663	About time. Seriously.
FO300020664	Agreed! Now it is time to apply those tactics!
FO300020665	Indeed. There are far more interesting things in the world than warfare.
FO300020666	Yes, enough about boring old tactics.
FO300020667	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
FO300020668	It was my goal to continue doing so until you told me otherwise.
FO300020669	Keep hanging back.
FO300020670	Very well. I will seek out better positions to cover you while you forge ahead.
FO300020671	That's what I'm doing. Why do you think I'm standing back here in East Bumfuck?
FO300020672	Keep hanging back.
FO300020673	Ha! Good plan. I'll try to get around behind 'em. I like how you think, kid.
FO300020674	I've had no compelling reason to do anything different from what you asked.
FO300020675	Keep hanging back.
FO300020676	Ha! Good plan. I'll try to get around behind 'em. I like how you think, kid.
FO300020677	I get any farther, I might as well be back in the bar. And that's sounding like a better idea all the time, trust me.
FO300020678	Keep hanging back.
FO300020679	What, don't you like my aftershave?
FO300020680	Yeah, got it. Flanking and tactics and stuff. Right.
FO300020681	If you insist, sir, but RL-3 functions best when closer to the fight!
FO300020682	Keep hanging back.
FO300020683	Stealth flanking mode active!
FO300020684	By all means. I simply hope I'm not too far in reserve, in case of unforeseen trouble.
FO300020685	Keep hanging back.
FO300020686	A sound plan. I trust this isn't simply to avoid being seen with a Super Mutant?
FO300020687	Eulogy used to like me to stay ten steps behind him. Usually.
FO300020688	Keep hanging back.
FO300020689	As you wish, but I'm not letting you out of my sight.
FO300020690	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
FO300020691	I will follow your lead.
FO300020692	C'mon, kid, why are we standin' around here?
FO300020693	Should you require advice, I am here.
FO300020694	About time, too!
FO300020695	Affirmative!
FO300020696	Yes, let's.
FO300020697	Yes, please.
FO300020698	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
FO300020699	If conversation is your order to me, I will converse with you.
FO300020700	As the Codex says: "Through discourse, we gain the strength of our Brothers' minds."
FO300020701	There better be some action soon, or I'm heading back to the bar.
FO300020702	Yes, sir? What, sir?
FO300020703	Certainly. What have you got in mind?
FO300020704	Is it going to be all talk?
FO300020705	Stay close to me.
FO300020706	I am happy if you are happy.
FO300020707	You're good where you are.
FO300020708	As you wish.
FO300020709	You're damn right I'm good, kid.
FO300020710	You're good where you are.
FO300020711	Sure, kid. Whatever you say.
FO300020712	I thought it so.
FO300020713	You're good where you are.
FO300020714	It allows for flexibility. A wise choice on your part.
FO300020715	Oh, I'm the best, baby.
FO300020716	You're good where you are.
FO300020717	You're good where you are.
FO300020718	Understood, sir. Proceeding as normal!
FO300020719	You're good where you are.
FO300020720	RL-3 will maintain a tactical distance!
FO300020721	I'll endeavor to continue, then.
FO300020722	You're good where you are.
FO300020723	A sound decision, yes.
FO300020724	Glad you like it.
FO300020725	You're good where you are.
FO300020726	As you wish, lover.
FO300020727	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
FO300020728	If you wanna get closer to me, that's all you gotta say, girl.
FO300020729	You mean how close you're following me, right? Sure, what's up?
FO300020730	Is there something that you wish me to change?
FO300020731	How close would you like?
FO300020732	As you wish. What about it?
FO300020733	I am open to your suggestions.
FO300020734	I want you to use ranged weapons.
FO300020735	You're goddamn right I'm not bad. I've been doin' this for 25 goddamn years.
FO300020736	You're not bad with a ranged weapon. Keep it up.
FO300020737	Good. I hate it when they bleed on me.
FO300020738	The same can be said of any Brother. We are trained well and tempered in the fires of battle.
FO300020739	You're not bad with a ranged weapon. Keep it up.
FO300020740	Very well. I shall cover your approach.
FO300020741	You'd better believe it! I should have gotten my hands on some of these earlier!
FO300020742	You're not bad with a ranged weapon. Keep it up.
FO300020743	Sure, I guess. Just don't get in my way, is all I'm saying.
FO300020744	It is what you wish of me.
FO300020745	You're not bad with a ranged weapon. Keep it up.
FO300020746	If that is what you wish, then it is what I shall do. I must say, that I find happiness in a warm gun.
FO300020747	Of course. It's so much more respectable than simply killing people at arm's reach.
FO300020748	You're not bad with a ranged weapon. Keep it up.
FO300020749	If you insist. I just wish there were another solution.
FO300020750	Anything for you, lover.
FO300020751	You're not bad with a ranged weapon. Keep it up.
FO300020752	Oh, do I have to? That's not nearly as much fun!
FO300020753	Switch to a melee weapon.
FO300020754	It is what you wished of me.
FO300020755	I like what you're doing. Stick with the melee.
FO300020756	If that is what you wish, then I will endeavor to do the best that I am able.
FO300020757	Shit yeah, you do.
FO300020758	I like what you're doing. Stick with the melee.
FO300020759	I appreciate the compliment. It is where I am most comfortable.
FO300020760	I like what you're doing. Stick with the melee.
FO300020761	They shall know the power of my steel!
FO300020762	Up close and personal, that's how I like it!
FO300020763	I like what you're doing. Stick with the melee.
FO300020764	At least my strength is useful for something. <sigh>
FO300020765	I like what you're doing. Stick with the melee.
FO300020766	Yes, of course. <sigh>
FO300020767	My pleasure, lover.
FO300020768	I like what you're doing. Stick with the melee.
FO300020769	Gladly. Face to face is so much more personal.
FO300020770	Let's talk about something else.
FO300020771	If conversation is what you wish, then I shall provide it.
FO300020772	You talk too damn much, anyone ever told you that?
FO300020773	If conversation is what you wish, perhaps you should have brought along a Scribe.
FO300020774	Do all the talking you want. Just don't expect me to, you know, listen or anything.
FO300020775	Gladly.
FO300020776	Oh, does it always have to be talk?
FO300020777	That's all. Let's get going.
FO300020778	I shall follow your lead.
FO300020779	Right behind you, kid.
FO300020780	I shall remain vigilant.
FO300020781	Let's rumble! Yeah!
FO300020782	Yes, let's be on our way.
FO300020783	Oh, time for fun already? Goody!
FO300020784	I want you to change your combat style.
FO300020785	What do you think would be best?
FO300020786	Oh yeah? To what?
FO300020787	A member of the Brotherhood is trained in all weapons as an Initiate. What do you wish?
FO300020788	I can stab, I can shoot, I can do lots of things. What's your pleasure?
FO300020789	In what way?
FO300020790	What would you like? I think you'll find I'm quite flexible.
FO300020791	Let's talk about your tactics.
FO300020792	Oh, like you know better? What?
FO300020793	Is there a problem with what I'm doing?
FO300020794	What are you thinking, lover?
FO300020795	You think you got a better idea?
FO300020796	Yes, the unpleasant necessities of battle. Your suggestions?
FO300020797	I am open to your suggestions.
FO300020798	I just wanted to make sure you were still here. Goodbye.
FO300020799	Charming.
FO300020800	As I am a "man of my word", there is nowhere else that I could possibly be.
FO300020801	Yeah, well the Snakes don't need you, anyway! We don't need nothing but liquor and guns! Yeah!
FO300020802	If there's one thing I've learned, it's patience. I can wait.
FO300020803	You big tease!
FO300020804	<growl>
FO300020805	Stay. Stay!
FO300020806	Not just yet. I wanted to talk to you about something.
FO300020807	Certainly. What is it?
FO300020808	Yeah? What do you want now?
FO300020809	What do you wish to speak to me about?
FO300020810	Oh, come on. What?
FO300020811	Yes, best to formulate a plan. What is it?
FO300020812	Oh, make it quick. I'm getting bored. I hate being bored.
FO300020813	<aroo?>
FO300020814	Hold on, Dogmeat.
FO300020815	Let's get going.
FO300020816	As you command.
FO300020817	Right on. I'm ready for more action.
FO300020818	Very well. I stand by your side.
FO300020819	Yeah, let's hit it!
FO300020820	Yes, sir!
FO300020821	With all due haste.
FO300020822	Oh yes, let's!
FO300020823	<bark!>
FO300020824	Come on, boy!
FO300020825	Yeah yeah, very funny.
FO300020826	Get lost, Butch. You're fired.
FO300020827	Are you certain that this is what you wish?
FO300020828	You're fired, Charon.
FO300020829	Leave me alone, Clover. You're fired.
FO300020830	<aroo?>
FO300020831	It's too dangerous here, Dogmeat. Go wait for me at Vault 101.
FO300020832	What? Are you serious?
FO300020833	Get out of here, Jericho. You're fired.
FO300020834	Are you certain?
FO300020835	You're fired, Fawkes. Stop following me around.
FO300020836	Are you certain?
FO300020837	We must part ways, Paladin Cross.
FO300020838	Sorry man. I don't know what's gotten into you but you're just a little too intense for me. Maybe come back after you've chilled out and we'll see.
FO300020839	Want to head back outside, Butch?
FO300020840	Sorry man. I don't know what's gotten into you but you're just a little too intense for me. Maybe come back after you've chilled out and we'll see.
FO300020841	Want to head back outside, Butch?
FO300020842	Nah, I'm good. I only roll with Tunnel Snakes. Come back when you're on your own.
FO300020843	Want to head back outside, Butch?
FO300020844	I guess I can let you back into the gang. Once a Snake, always a Snake, huh? Let's roll!
FO300020845	Want to head back outside, Butch?
FO300020846	I regret that I cannot join you at this time. You seem to already have someone in your employ.
FO300020847	I want you to come with me, Charon.
FO300020848	You are my employer and I will do as you command.
FO300020849	I want you to come with me, Charon.
FO300020850	Sorry, honey. Three's a crowd. Come back when I can have you all to myself.
FO300020851	How would you like to come with me, Clover?
FO300020852	Absolutely, lover. Let's go have some fun.
FO300020853	How would you like to come with me, Clover?
FO300020854	<bark!>
FO300020855	Come on, Dogmeat. Let's go!
FO300020856	Sorry, kid. I just can't roll with someone like you.
FO300020857	If you pick up a few bad habits, maybe I'll change my mind.
FO300020858	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
FO300020859	Sorry, kid. I'd love to, but there just ain't enough supplies to go around. Ditch the loser and then we'll talk.
FO300020860	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
FO300020861	Thank Christ. I really didn't want to go back to Megaton after what happened to that place.
FO300020862	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
FO300020863	Thank Christ. I thought I was gonna grow a fourth arm sitting next to all this fucking radiation.
FO300020864	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
FO300020865	Now that's what I like to hear! I'll be right behind you!
FO300020866	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
FO300020867	My friend, I am saddened to hear that you have turned away from a noble path.
FO300020868	Return to me when you have learned to take right action, and I will walk with you.
FO300020869	Care to join me, Fawkes? I would appreciate your assistance.
FO300020870	My friend, I would love to join you, but I fear that your traveling companion would not accept me.
FO300020871	Return to me when you are alone, and I will join you.
FO300020872	Care to join me, Fawkes? I would appreciate your assistance.
FO300020873	I owe you no less than my life. How could I refuse?
FO300020874	Care to join me, Fawkes? I would appreciate your assistance.
FO300020875	Sir, I regret to inform you that this unit cannot accept orders from an officer under a Court Marshall!
FO300020876	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
FO300020877	I should definitely say so! Time to roll out!
FO300020878	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
FO300020879	It is regrettable, but I cannot follow one such as you. Restore your good name, and perhaps I shall reconsider.
FO300020880	I would like your assistance once again, Paladin Cross.
FO300020881	It is my sincere wish to join you, but so long as you travel with one who is not of the Brotherhood, I simply cannot risk myself.
FO300020882	I would like your assistance once again, Paladin Cross.
FO300020883	And it is my duty to offer it, as I have sworn. I shall follow and protect you.
FO300020884	I would like your assistance once again, Paladin Cross.
FO300020885	Sounds good. Let's get out of here.
FO300020886	Would that I could. Although you are now my employer, traveling in such a large crowd would be foolish.
FO300020887	I shall wait here until your party is smaller.
FO300020888	As you wish.
FO300020889	Whoa! What the fuck was that?
FO300020890	Ahzrukhal was an evil bastard. So long as he held my contract, I was honor bound to do as he commanded.
FO300020891	But now you are my employer, which freed me to rid the world of that disgusting rat. And now, for good or ill, I serve you.
FO300020892	But I cannot come with you. Although you are now my employer, traveling in such a large crowd would be foolish.
FO300020893	I shall wait here until your party is smaller.
FO300020894	Ahzrukhal was an evil bastard. So long as he held my contract, I was honor bound to do as he commanded.
FO300020895	But now you are my employer, which freed me to rid the world of that disgusting rat. And now, for good or ill, I serve you.
FO300020896	Oh my God! He shot Ahzrukhal!
FO300020897	What's going on?
FO300020898	FollowersCharonConfrontAhzrukhal3
FO300020899	Yes.
FO300020900	FollowersCharonConfrontAhzrukhal2
FO300020901	That's right, Charon. Have you come to say goodbye?
FO300020902	FollowersCharonConfrontAhzrukhal1
FO300020903	Ahzrukhal. I am told that I am no longer in your service.
FO300020904	Slow down, there. I have good news. I'm your new employer.
FO300020905	You purchased my contract from Ahzrukhal? So, I am no longer in his service. That is good to know.
FO300020906	Please, wait here. I must take care of something.
FO300020907	Oh no. None of that. You belong to me now.
FO300020908	I belong to no one. If you are my new employer, then I will serve you. But first, I must take care of something. Wait here.
FO300020909	I want nothing to do with this.
FO300020910	No stomach for hard work, eh? No matter. If you don't want to do the job, then come up with the cash. Otherwise, I'll just hang on to this contract.
FO300020911	Sure. Greta is nothing to me. I'll do it.
FO300020912	I'm glad to hear it. Come back to me when she's dead and Charon's contract is all yours.
FO300020913	A word of advice: be subtle. Open gunplay will only get the town to turn on you, and I will not be able to help you.
FO300020914	Why not just have Charon do it?
FO300020915	Loyal employee that he is, Charon would do it without question if I asked him to. However, the entire town would come down on me for it.
FO300020916	Greta is quite popular around here. If Charon is the one who kills her, everyone will know that it was me who ordered Greta's death.
FO300020917	I need Charon clearly visible and in public when Greta dies, so that I can fairly claim ignorance of the situation.
FO300020918	I've changed my mind.
FO300020919	That's a shame. I guess I'll just have to hold on to this contract a little bit longer.
FO300020920	Couldn't we work out some sort of deal?
FO300020921	Is she now? Well, it seems that this arrangement worked out well for both of us.
FO300020922	With the new profit I'll make from Greta's customers, I'll be able to hire a replacement for Charon with plenty left over for myself.
FO300020923	And you held up your end of the deal, my friend. And I am a man of his word. Charon's contract is yours. You are his new employer. Congratulations.
FO300020924	I'll give you the pleasure of informing him yourself.
FO300020925	About that deal we had: Greta is dead as promised.
FO300020926	Yes. She is. And you have Charon's contact, per our bargain. Now get him out of here.
FO300020927	With the new profit I'll make from Greta's customers, I'll be able to hire a replacement for Charon with plenty left over for myself.
FO300020928	And you held up your end of the deal, my friend. And I am a man of his word. Charon's contract is yours. You are his new employer. Congratulations.
FO300020929	I'll give you the pleasure of informing him yourself.
FO300020930	About that deal we had: Greta is dead as promised.
FO300020931	My friend, we already have a deal. You can have the contract when Greta is dead. It's very simple.
FO300020932	I suppose we could do that, although you might not like the deal that I have to offer. You see, I don't like competition. Not at all.
FO300020933	It goes against every principle that I have as a businessman. So, the fact that there is another source for booze in town troubles me.
FO300020934	I'll give you 5,000 caps for it.
FO300020935	I'll give you the pleasure of informing Charon yourself.
FO300020936	You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
FO300020937	I'll give you 4,000 caps for it.
FO300020938	I'll give you the pleasure of informing Charon yourself.
FO300020939	You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
FO300020940	I'll give you 3,000 caps for it.
FO300020941	I'll give you the pleasure of informing Charon yourself.
FO300020942	You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
FO300020943	I'll give you 2,000 caps for it.
FO300020944	I'll give you the pleasure of informing Charon yourself.
FO300020945	You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
FO300020946	I'll give you 1,000 caps for it.
FO300020947	I'll give you the pleasure of informing Charon yourself.
FO300020948	You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
FO300020949	I want to talk to you about Charon's contract.
FO300020950	Is she now? Well, it seems that this arrangement worked out well for both of us.
FO300020951	With the new profit I'll make from Greta's customers, I'll be able to hire a replacement for Charon with plenty left over for myself.
FO300020952	And you held up your end of the deal, my friend. And I am a man of his word. Charon's contract is yours. You are his new employer. Congratulations.
FO300020953	I'll give you the pleasure of informing him yourself.
FO300020954	About that deal we had: Greta is dead as promised.
FO300020955	Yes. She is. And you have Charon's contract. I think that deal is complete.
FO300020956	The rest is between you and Charon.
FO300020957	About that deal we had: Greta is dead as promised.
FO300020958	I knew you'd change your mind. Just remember, Charon is a valuable asset to me and he doesn't come cheap. Are you ready to deal?
FO300020959	Oh? Would you, now? He is a highly valuable asset to me and to the Ninth Circle. What did you have in mind?
FO300020960	What was our deal again?
FO300020961	For every five bits of Scrap Metal you give me, I'll give you a Stimpak, some RadAway, or a dose of Rad-X. I need scrap, you need goods. We both win.
FO300020962	I'll take some Rad-X.
FO300020963	One for you, five for me. Use it in good health.
FO300020964	Two for you, ten for me. Use 'em in good health.
FO300020965	Three for you, fifteen for me. Use 'em in good health.
FO300020966	Four for you, twenty for me. Use 'em in good health.
FO300020967	Five for you, twenty-five for me. Use 'em in good health.
FO300020968	I'll take the RadAway.
FO300020969	Alright, five bits of Scrap Metal for one dose of RadAway. That's a done deal.
FO300020970	Alright, ten bits of Scrap Metal for two doses of RadAway. That's a done deal.
FO300020971	Alright, fifteen bits of Scrap Metal for three doses of RadAway. That's a done deal.
FO300020972	Alright, twenty bits of Scrap Metal for four doses of RadAway. That's a done deal.
FO300020973	Alright, twenty-five bits of Scrap Metal for five doses of RadAway. That's a done deal.
FO300020974	I'll take the Stimpaks
FO300020975	Five bits of Scrap Metal for me, one Stimpak for you -- it's been a pleasure doing business.
FO300020976	I'll take the Stimpak.
FO300020977	Ten bits of Scrap Metal for me, two Stimpaks for you -- it's been a pleasure doing business.
FO300020978	Fifteen bits of Scrap Metal for me, three Stimpaks for you -- it's been a pleasure doing business.
FO300020979	Twenty bits of Scrap Metal for me, four Stimpaks for you -- it's been a pleasure doing business.
FO300020980	Twenty-Five bits of Scrap Metal for me, five Stimpaks for you -- it's been a pleasure doing business.
FO300020981	You wanted me to get some Scrap Metal for you, right?
FO300020982	Oh? Have you changed your mind? Are you willing to trade some scrap?
FO300020983	I've got 25 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
FO300020984	I didn't expect you to bring back so much! That'll set me up for quite some time. So, what'd you have in mind for payment?
FO300020985	I've got 20 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
FO300020986	Twenty! That's great! I knew this'd work out! Just tell me what you want in return for the parts.
FO300020987	I've got 15 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
FO300020988	Fifteen? Well, alright! A deal's a deal, so what do you want in return?
FO300020989	I've got 10 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
FO300020990	Ten parts, eh? Alright, what do you want in trade?
FO300020991	I've got 5 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
FO300020992	Alright, sounds good. What to you want for 'em?
FO300020993	Actually, never mind. I don't want to trade any Scrap Metal.
FO300020994	Okay, then. Your call. Let me know when you do.
FO300020995	What were you offering to trade?
FO300020996	I'll trade you five bits of Scrap Metal for a Stimpak, a pack of Radway, or a dose of Rad-X. Easy deal.
FO300020997	No, I haven't changed my mind.
FO300020998	They why are we even talking about this? I'm very busy, you know.
FO300020999	Yes, I've changed my mind. I'll bring you some Scrap Metal
FO300021000	You have? Good. Excellent! We need those parts something awful. This place is falling apart.
FO300021001	Just come on back and talk to me when you have some parts to trade, we'll work out a deal.
FO300021002	I have some scrap metal for you.
FO300021003	Oh, good, the vents are rattling again. I need to get up there and take care of it. What do you have?
FO300021004	And not a moment too soon.
FO300021005	Really? Great! I can finally get around to patching up the heaters.
FO300021006	Go ahead and yell. I'll kill every last one of you.
FO300021007	This is the last mistake you'll ever make! Help! Someone help me!
FO300021008	You'll be dead long before help gets here.
FO300021009	Fine, Fine, you asshole. I offered you a fair trade, and this is how it is? Here, take it. Take it all and get the fuck out.
FO300021010	I never want to lay my eyes on you again, you miserable bastard.
FO300021011	Heh. I was just kidding. Now, what were you saying about a job?
FO300021012	You've got a strange way of joking, stranger.
FO300021013	I was saying that I need spare parts to fix the junk around here, and I'm willing to trade for 'em.
FO300021014	Yes. As in: I won't cut your throat and watch you die gasping for air.
FO300021015	Yes. As in, "I won't make a five egg omelet out of your face."
FO300021016	Yes. As in: I won't shoot your face off and dance in your brains.
FO300021017	Yes. As in: I won't shoot your face off and dance in your brains.
FO300021018	Yes. As in: I won't pull your arms off and laugh as you die.
FO300021019	Haha! You go ahead and try it, stranger. I'll have Cerberus over here to tear your arms off before you even draw.
FO300021020	Look, you're cute, but you're not the first Waster to threaten me and you won't be the last. Just clear out of town. We don't need your type here.
FO300021021	What sort of payment are we talking about?
FO300021022	Well, we got Stimpaks, but the Doc keeps us healed up, so we don't really need 'em. So I could trade one of those for five bits of Scrap Metal.
FO300021023	We also got us a TON of RadAway and Rad-X. I mean, what good is it to us? But I'll trade you either one for five bits of scrap. Your choice.
FO300021024	I have a better idea. How about I do nothing and you give me what you have?
FO300021025	What? What are you talking about? Do nothing?
FO300021026	Take care of your own problems.
FO300021027	That's a shame, stranger. A real shame. Let me know if you change your mind, we'll still need the parts.
FO300021028	Sure, Winthrop. I think I can help you out.
FO300021029	Well, alright. That's good to hear, stranger. Just come on back to me when you've gathered some Scrap Metal.
FO300021030	This is so fascinating, I can't bear to talk about it any longer.
FO300021031	Hey, you asked. Don't blame me if you don't like what you hear.
FO300021032	Why? What's wrong?
FO300021033	We've scavenged just about all of the scrap metal from all of the places we can safely get to.
FO300021034	We're scraping the bottom of the barrel here. Hell, not before long, I'm gonna have to disassemble poor ol' Cerberus for parts.
FO300021035	Hey, you get around, don't you? Tell you what, you bring me back any Scrap Metal you find out there and I'll trade you whatever I can.
FO300021036	We can work out a trade. We've got some stuff around here that we don't need, but a smoothskin like you might make use of it.
FO300021037	What do you do around here, Winthrop?
FO300021038	Me? I keep every hunk of old rusted pre-war garbage around here in operating condition.
FO300021039	We've got lights, water, and ventilation all running off the old crap they used to keep this place going for the tourists.
FO300021040	Me? I keep every hunk of old rusted pre-war garbage around here in operating condition.
FO300021041	We've got lights, water, and ventilation all running off the old crap they used to keep this place going for the tourists.
FO300021042	RCGoodbye14
FO300021043	It's a tough job. I wouldn't want it.
FO300021044	I heard Danvers has his job now.
FO300021045	I hope they find someone to fill his shoes soon.
FO300021046	LLGuarding
FO300021047	We used to have two guards here. Me and an older girl named Caps.
FO300021048	But since the last time Raiders attacked, it's just been me.
FO300021049	I really miss Caps.
FO300021050	Are you the only guard on the front gate?
FO300021051	Now I am, yeah. But I'm a good guard, and no one's getting by me, now.
FO300021052	Are you the only guard on the front gate?
FO300021053	Yeah. Right now, we don't even have anyone to cover me when I'm asleep.
FO300021054	Now leave me alone, I've got to be ready for duty soon.
FO300021055	Don't you guard the front gate?
FO300021056	It's so dull! Practically nothing ever tries to come through the back gate anymore, so I never get to shoot anyone.
FO300021057	I wish I was at the front gate, but RJ specifically put me back here. Up front, at least there's a chance I can shoot some unwanted visitors.
FO300021058	Which could have included you, mungo.
FO300021059	What's it like, guarding the back gate?
FO300021060	Well, technically, I'm patrolling and "keeping the peace."
FO300021061	Mostly that involves making sure people are happy and not getting into trouble. You can't very well keep the peace if you've already lost it, see?
FO300021062	You said you're in charge of "morale." What does that mean?
FO300021063	No, because Princess always bosses me around and there's never nothing to gun.
FO300021064	That's all I'm gonna say while she's around.
FO300021065	Do you enjoy guarding the back gate?
FO300021066	No, because Princess always bosses me around and there's never nothing to gun.
FO300021067	She's always making fun of me just because she's angry all the time about her nickname and not being in charge and stuff.
FO300021068	Do you enjoy guarding the back gate?
FO300021069	Can you give me directions?
FO300021070	Okay, where are you going?
FO300021071	Well, where to?
FO300021072	I should be able to do that.
FO300021073	I dunno. I still get lost sometimes. Things are really big.
FO300021074	No. Scram.
FO300021075	Where to, man?
FO300021076	To where, man?
FO300021077	Where? I've been just about everywhere down here, so I can get you to anywhere down here.
FO300021078	Where to, mungo?
FO300021079	What do I look like, your tour guide?
FO300021080	Rude First Response
FO300021081	It sure is! Nice work bringing them back.
FO300021082	You didn't happen to bring anything else back, did you? Stories, jokes, lessons for the folks here?
FO300021083	Speaking of which: I'm Knock Knock, and I keep people's spirits up down here. If you want to trade jokes, just knock knock on my door!
FO300021084	I'm the big hero who rescued your friends from the Slavers. How's that for cool?
FO300021085	Being a jerk about it isn't necessary. In fact, if you've got any interesting stories from up there, and you're looking to tell them, let me know.
FO300021086	I'm Knock Knock, and I keep people's spirits up down here. If you want to trade jokes, just knock knock on my door!
FO300021087	I'm from up above. So stay out of my way, kid.
FO300021088	But wait, you don't even know who I am yet!
FO300021089	Beat it, kid. You bother me.
FO300021090	Boo-hoo. You big baby.
FO300021091	You're still a mungo, and I still don't like mungos.
FO300021092	You want a party or something, you go pay some mungos to be your friends and they can all talk about how great you are. How's that?
FO300021093	Gee, what a great reception for a returning hero.
FO300021094	Just give it a shot, mungo. You'll see plenty of my adult-sized stones when I'm pissing on your grave.
FO300021095	Sure, if you've got the adult-sized stones to stop me.
FO300021096	I'm Stacey, and I take care of the front gate. If you're going in or out, I'll take care of it.
FO300021097	I'm new in town, and you're already threatening me? Not a good start.
FO300021098	Lucky thing you're not a stranger anymore. Least, not as long as MacCready says you aren't.
FO300021099	I'm new in town, and you're already threatening me? Not a good start, kid.
FO300021100	You brought back Penny and Sammy and Squirrel? Well, I guess that does make you a pretty big hero. Thanks!
FO300021101	I'm Lucy, and I'm pretty much the mom around here. And that means I spend a lot of time kissing boo-boos and making things all better.
FO300021102	I rescued those captured kids. I'm a big hero.
FO300021103	Well, if you brought them back, then I guess that explains why RJ let you in. So, I guess that does make you a big hero.
FO300021104	I'm Lucy, and I'm pretty much mommy to the folks here. I try to keep them safe, and when that's not enough I patch up their cuts and bruises.
FO300021105	And when that's not enough, I make sure they get a funeral. Thanks for making sure I didn't have to do that for three more of mine.
FO300021106	I rescued those captured kids. I'm a big hero.
FO300021107	Oh, is it? Well, I'm Lucy, and I'm the doctor in town. From the sound of it, I'll be seeing a lot of you. Or your work.
FO300021108	I'm new in town, and that's all you need to know.
FO300021109	That was you? Well, you brought my sister Penny back, so sure, I'll call you a big hero. Thank you very much.
FO300021110	I'm Joseph, and as the oldest kid in Lamplight, I'm pretty much a teacher by default. I also try to keep the kids clean and fresh-faced.
FO300021111	I'm not sure if there's anything I can teach you, but if you need a haircut or the like, just say the word. And thanks again.
FO300021112	I'm the big hero who saved those kidnapped kids.
FO300021113	Well, if MacCready let you in, I'm sure he's got his reasons.
FO300021114	I'm Joseph, and as the oldest kid in Lamplight, I'm pretty much a teacher by default.
FO300021115	I'm not sure if there's anything I can teach you, but if you need a haircut or the like, just say the word.
FO300021116	I'm new. Get used to me.
FO300021117	You got that right! After our regular meals, I bet some of us would give that a shot! If we had a brahmin down here, that is.
FO300021118	If you need a meal down here, just talk with me. You'll hardly even know you're eating cave mold.
FO300021119	I'd rather eat a Brahmin turd sandwich. With no bread.
FO300021120	Oh, really? So you're saying you brought back three more hungry mouths, too? Great, you're just making my day better and better!
FO300021121	Look, I'm Eclair, and I'm in charge of the crap we call food down here. And we've got precious little enough to go around as it is.
FO300021122	So, yeah, thanks for bringing those folks back alive, but don't expect me to throw you a big party over it.
FO300021123	Hey, I rescued those kids from the Slavers. You owe me some respect, kid.
FO300021124	That's a shame. I was going to serve yours with extra lung butter.
FO300021125	My name's Eclair, and I've dealt with bigger threats than you. So watch your step.
FO300021126	Don't make me laugh. I don't give a damn about your food.
FO300021127	Oh, okay. Bye.
FO300021128	None of your business, squirt.
FO300021129	You don't look like a monster. Eclair says monsters are green or got all kinds of arms and you only got two and they're like mine.
FO300021130	You just look like a mungo, and Knock Knock says they don't eat people unless they're lost and have to.
FO300021131	I'm a terrible monster, come to eat you up!
FO300021132	Oh, you'll listen to me. Otherwise, I'll have my good pal RJ kick you out of the town. Or better yet, lock you in the vault.
FO300021133	So don't push me, new meat. Just nod and move on and I think we'll get along just fine.
FO300021134	Did you just try to give me orders? That's cute, little Princess.
FO300021135	Now listen up! I'm Princess, and I don't care what RJ says, when you're around me, I'm in charge.
FO300021136	Give me any trouble, mungo, and I can get you kicked out of here in a flash. Or worse.
FO300021137	I don't work for anyone. But give me any trouble, and you'll regret it.
FO300021138	It sure isn't bad! Nice work bringing them back.
FO300021139	You didn't happen to bring anything else back, did you? Gear, equipment, bric-a-brac?
FO300021140	Speaking of which: I'm Knick Knack, and I run the store down here. If you want to trade anything, come on by the Souvenir Store and we'll talk.
FO300021141	I'm the big hero who rescued your friends from the Slavers. How's that for cool?
FO300021142	You don't have to be a jerk about it. In fact, if you've got stuff from up above, and you're looking to get rid of some of it, let me know.
FO300021143	I'm Knick Knack, and I run the store down here. If you want to trade anything, come on by the Souvenir Store and we'll talk.
FO300021144	I'm from up above. So stay out of my way, kid.
FO300021145	Friendly First Response
FO300021146	New kids don't tend to walk up every day. We haven't had very good luck with visitors recently.
FO300021147	Anyway, I'm Stacey, and I guard the front gate. If you need in or out, I can take care of that.
FO300021148	Well, I'm glad there wasn't any blood over a misunderstanding.
FO300021149	Only people who use that gate are strangers. And most strangers aren't welcome here.
FO300021150	I'm Stacey, and I make sure strangers stay out. If the mayor hadn't let you in himself, I'd make sure you stayed out, too.
FO300021151	Well, I'm glad there wasn't any blood over a misunderstanding.
FO300021152	You saved Penny and Sammy and Squirrel? I can see why RJ let you in! Thanks, for all of us!
FO300021153	I'm Lucy, and I pretty much spend my days playing mommy around here. I spend a lot of time kissing boo-boos and making things better.
FO300021154	If you get a scraped knee or stubbed toe, come see me. Same if you get shot in the face or burns all over, but I can only promise so much.
FO300021155	I'm a guest in town. Mayor MacCready let me in for rescuing your friends.
FO300021156	Well, it's good that you're safe in here, now. The Wastes can be dangerous, although you look like you've done alright out there.
FO300021157	I'm Lucy, and I'm the closest thing we've got to a doctor around here. If you get yourself into trouble, see if you can drag yourself back here.
FO300021158	Mayor MacCready let me in. I don't want to cause any problems.
FO300021159	If you convinced RJ that you're safe, I guess I'll go along. But if you do start trouble, you'll regret it.
FO300021160	I'm Lucy, the doctor here. That means I handle the funerals, too. So much as look at a kid the wrong way, and I'll be seeing you again.
FO300021161	Mayor MacCready let me in. I don't want to cause any problems.
FO300021162	That was you? Well, my most sincere thanks, then. You brought my sister Penny back to me, and I couldn't ask more than that.
FO300021163	I'm Joseph, and if there's ever anything I can do for you here, just name it!
FO300021164	As the oldest kid in town, I spend most of my time teaching, but I do what I can to keep the kids clean and fresh-faced.
FO300021165	Say, if you're ever looking for a haircut, I'd be glad to offer my services. You only have to ask!
FO300021166	Mayor MacCready let me in for rescuing those kids.
FO300021167	I'm Joseph, and around here, I might as well be the old wise man. Try not to interrupt my classes, and I think we'll get along just fine.
FO300021168	As the oldest kid in town, I spend most of my time teaching, but I do what I can to keep the kids clean and fresh-faced.
FO300021169	If you're looking for a haircut, feel free to ask. I'll do what I can.
FO300021170	Mayor MacCready let me in. I don't want to cause any problems.
FO300021171	Okay, either you're a dirty liar or you're some sort of freak.
FO300021172	Either way, you should fit in just fine around here! Folks call me Eclair, and I'm in charge of keeping this place fed.
FO300021173	You need a meal, you come ask me. There's not much to go around, and it all tastes bad, but it'll keep you alive, and that's good enough.
FO300021174	That sounds delicious.
FO300021175	Oh, great. Maybe next, he'll take in a Deathclaw or something. And he'll make it the town mascot.
FO300021176	But anyway, yeah, thanks for bringing them back in one piece. Maybe now they'll learn to be more careful out there!
FO300021177	If you need what passes for food down here, look me up. Name's Eclair, and if you so much as snicker, I'll carve you up for steaks.
FO300021178	The Mayor let me in for rescuing those kidnapped kids.
FO300021179	Oh, great. Maybe next, he'll take in a Deathclaw or something. He can make it the town mascot.
FO300021180	Anyway, my name's Eclair, and yes, I take care of the food here. Don't expect any scraps from our table.
FO300021181	The Mayor let me in. I'm not planning on causing trouble.
FO300021182	It's nice to meet you, too. Did you come from the vault? I heard there's monsters down there.
FO300021183	Eclair told me once, one of them, they got him and bit him right in the face and that's why he's only got one eye.
FO300021184	But you don't look like a monster, and I don't think you'd bite anyone in the face. You look like a nice vault dweller.
FO300021185	Sometimes, people call me the Vault Dweller. It's nice to meet you.
FO300021186	Did you live in the old vault below? I thought nobody lives down there now because it was full of monsters.
FO300021187	Mayor doesn't let us go down there because when they went they didn't come back.
FO300021188	You don't look like someone who didn't come back, so maybe you didn't come from there.
FO300021189	I'm not any of those. I'm a Vault Dweller. At least, I was when I was your age.
FO300021190	Good! Glad we've got that settled. Stay out of my way, and there won't be any problems.
FO300021191	Whatever you say.
FO300021192	Oh, you think Sammy and the rest wouldn't have gotten back on their own eventually? I taught him better than that.
FO300021193	Well, if you're sticking around, you ought to know that I'm Princess, and I call the shots around here.
FO300021194	And don't forget it, mungo!
FO300021195	The Mayor let me in because I rescued some of your friends.
FO300021196	Well, if you're sticking around, you ought to know that I'm Princess, and I call the shots around here.
FO300021197	And don't forget it, mungo!
FO300021198	The Mayor let me in. I'm not here to cause problems.
FO300021199	Speaking of which, I'm Knick Knack, and I take care of the general store around here.
FO300021200	Which is to say, I collect a lot of stuff, and sometimes trade it for other stuff. That's pretty much a store, see?
FO300021201	I'm from Vault 101, and I rescued some of your friends from the Slavers.
FO300021202	In that case, I'm Knick Knack, and I take care of the general store around here.
FO300021203	Which is to say, I collect a lot of stuff, and sometimes trade it for other stuff. That's pretty much a store, see?
FO300021204	The Mayor let me in. I'm not here to cause any trouble.
FO300021205	Speaking of which, I'm Knock Knock, and I take care of the general morale around here.
FO300021206	Which is to say, I collect a lot of stories, and sometimes trade them to keep the others amused. Morale's better than less-al, see?
FO300021207	I'm from Vault 101, and I rescued some of your friends from the Slavers.
FO300021208	Always good to hear, but not even any fun trouble? Even a little?
FO300021209	See, I collect a lot of stories, and sometimes trade them to keep the others amused. A bit of fun trouble is always good for morale.
FO300021210	Morale's better than less-al, see?
FO300021211	The Mayor let me in. I'm not here to cause any trouble.
FO300021212	That's good, they don't like me having my gun in town, so I gotta turn it in first, so if I had to shoot you you'd have to wait a bit.
FO300021213	My name's Zip. I don't think that's short for anything, because I don't know what it'd be short for. Zippy? Zipperick? Ziptholomew?
FO300021214	So yeah, it's good to meet you, big kid, and maybe you've got big kid stuff from up top. Do you have any Nuka-Cola, maybe? Yes? Please?
FO300021215	No, you don't need to shoot me. Just think of me as a big kid.
FO300021216	Oh, that's good because Mayor MacCready says I can't have my gun in town anymore, not since last time, but that was totally an accident anyway!
FO300021217	That reminds me, got any Nuka-Cola? 'Cause if I'm not gonna have a gun in town, then it must be okay for me to have more Nuka, right?
FO300021218	Anyway, everyone calls me Zip, you know, like a zipper, only not really like that because I'm not made of metal, but I do go up and down, I guess.
FO300021219	No, no, I'm not here to cause any problems! You don't need your gun!
FO300021220	Good. Better stay that way, mungo.
FO300021221	I'm not planning on starting any trouble.
FO300021222	Well, I could call you a shithead, but then all these other shitheads wouldn't know which shithead I was talking to. Shithead.
FO300021223	So it looks like you're stuck with mungo, mungo.
FO300021224	It means an adult. We don't really see many of you around, and we're glad of it.
FO300021225	I mean, you brought back the little ones, so you're okay. But mostly, we only ever see raiders and people who want to take our caves.
FO300021226	If you didn't have MacCready's permission, you'd probably be shot just for being in here. We don't take any more chances.
FO300021227	Why does everyone call me a mungo?
FO300021228	I'm pretty sure it comes from "humongous." Because, to everyone here, you're pretty big, you know?
FO300021229	Mungos been pretty bad to Lamplighters, for as long as our history goes back. They just don't trust anyone over sixteen.
FO300021230	Really, you're pretty lucky they let you in at all. I just hope I get to visit like you do after I get kicked out.
FO300021231	Why do people call me mungo? What does that even mean?
FO300021232	Stop calling me kid, mungo.
FO300021233	Stop calling me mungo, kid.
FO300021234	LLServices
FO300021235	Really? Because I heard from the mayor about the sorts of deals you make when you trade. None for you.
FO300021236	Let's trade.
FO300021237	Sure thing, pal! Special deals for us kids!
FO300021238	Let's trade.
FO300021239	I hope you brought me some cool stuff!
FO300021240	Let's trade.
FO300021241	Yeah, I heard about the sorts of things you'd do for this fungus. Well, you're cut off. Go scrounge your own food.
FO300021242	I'd like some food.
FO300021243	Bon appetit.
FO300021244	I'd like some food.
FO300021245	Sure thing, mungo. We don't have much to spare, so get ready to pay.
FO300021246	I'd like some food.
FO300021247	Enjoy, if you've got the caps.
FO300021248	I'd like some food.
FO300021249	All right. Now, hold still.
FO300021250	Can you give me a haircut?
FO300021251	Certainly. How would you like to look?
FO300021252	Can you give me a haircut?
FO300021253	LLNicknames
FO300021254	Well, I didn't get the nickname for being fat and full of cream, if that's what you're asking.
FO300021255	Back when I was on the scav team, I found some pages from an old cook book. Sometimes I try them out.
FO300021256	Just for the record, don't try making an eclair out of cave fungus. The taste sticks with you, and not in a good way.
FO300021257	Why are you called Eclair?
FO300021258	It's just a name, okay?
FO300021259	Not my fault I knock stuff over.
FO300021260	Lucy says I still got a lot of growing to do.
FO300021261	Why do they call you Bumble?
FO300021262	I don't need to explain myself to you, mungo. Shut up and get lost.
FO300021263	In fact, don't you ever bother me about something as stupid as nicknames again!
FO300021264	How did someone like you get a nickname like Princess?
FO300021265	Well, my name was Nick. And I collect knick knacks.
FO300021266	Not everything has to be real complex, see?
FO300021267	Why are you called Knick Knack?
FO300021268	Well, when people started calling Knicky by his new name, I needed one too, see?
FO300021269	If you're twins, it just doesn't cut it to be called "Knick Knack and Sue."
FO300021270	Why are you called Knock Knock?
FO300021271	Why Zip? Or why do I have a nickname at all? I mean, why don't people just call me Ricky? Or Yancy? Or Eustace P. Vanderbanger the Third?
FO300021272	I mean, they say it's because I'm so fast, but that doesn't make sense because I don't think I'm all that fast, it's just that they're all so slow!
FO300021273	I guess it's just one of those mysteries that'll never really get answered, sort of like how people made the bubbles in Nuka-Cola. Say, got any Cola?
FO300021274	Why are you called Zip?
FO300021275	It's not a nickname! My name's Penelope.
FO300021276	They're just lazy and don't like saying the whole thing is all.
FO300021277	Why do you have the nickname Penny?
FO300021278	I like to think it's because of my inquisitive and charming nature, as well as my natural climbing ability.
FO300021279	But Knock Knock says it's because I'm totally nuts.
FO300021280	Guess which one's probably right?
FO300021281	Why are you called Squirrel?
FO300021282	Nickname? What awe you tawking about?
FO300021283	Maybe I'll regret this, but how did you get your nickname, Biwwy?
FO300021284	LLClasses
FO300021285	It's great, but Bumble's always trying to bug him when he's trying to teach me.
FO300021286	She's just jealous because she doesn't have a brother anymore.
FO300021287	What do you think about these classes?
FO300021288	Yeah. What I don't like's being bugged when I'm trying to learn.
FO300021289	Do you like classes with Joseph?
FO300021290	I hold open classes every morning for anyone who's got an interest in learning about a subject. Obviously, voluntary attendance is usually low.
FO300021291	I wouldn't normally let someone like you sit in, but since you saved Penny's life, it's the least I can offer.
FO300021292	Would you like to hear our history? It's something of a favorite.
FO300021293	Could you tell me about this class?
FO300021294	I hold open classes every morning for anyone who's got an interest in learning about a subject.
FO300021295	Obviously, voluntary attendance is usually low, so I keep myself busy here and there.
FO300021296	You're welcome to sit in, of course. Would you like to hear our history? It's something of a favorite with the students.
FO300021297	Could you tell me about this class?
FO300021298	I learned how to tie my shoes, and how to put out a fire, and how to put bullets into a gun!
FO300021299	Once my hands get big enough to hold one, Joseph says he's gonna teach me how to shoot for real!
FO300021300	Learning is fun!
FO300021301	What do you think of Joseph's classes?
FO300021302	Okay, that's enough.
FO300021303	Okay.
FO300021304	I'm looking for Vault 87. Can you help me find it?
FO300021305	You can only get there through Murder Pass, and we keep guards there to keep the little kids out.
FO300021306	But if you want to have a look, it's north of the souvenir shop.
FO300021307	Where can I get some food?
FO300021308	Right here. Welcome to our fungus pools. Eat up!
FO300021309	Just take the tunnel south of here and go right. You'll find the fungus pool grottos.
FO300021310	Take that tunnel north and when you hit the fork, go left. You'll find the fungus pools easy enough.
FO300021311	It's to the west of the entrance. Look for the grotto with the pools and stuff.
FO300021312	Do you have a trader in town?
FO300021313	Whenever I'm at my treasure trove in the souvenir shop, I'll sell whatever you're looking for!
FO300021314	Knick Knack's the one who's got the treasure trove of junk to sell. Ask him when he's in here.
FO300021315	There's a souvenir shop just north of the entrance. That's where Knick Knack sells whatever else we can't use. Check there.
FO300021316	Where can I find a doctor?
FO300021317	Yeah, that's me. I'm only on duties when I'm in the office.
FO300021318	In here, but only when Lucy's in her office. Talk with her when she's on-duty.
FO300021319	You know that office building near the entrance? When Lucy's at work in there, she's the one who patches us up.
FO300021320	LLRandomConvEnding
FO300021321	Hee hee! Okay, later then!
FO300021322	Okay. See you later, and don't get too bashed up.
FO300021323	I understand. Well, take care.
FO300021324	I hear that. Anyway, gotta be on my way. Later.

FO300021338	I'm fine. It's another fine day, underground.
FO300021339	Doing good. I could do with better food, but couldn't we all?
FO300021340	I'm fine, thanks!
FO300021341	What do you think? Get out of my face!
FO300021342	Doing better than a dog in a bone-yard!
FO300021343	Happier than a Ghoul wallowing in sludge!
FO300021344	Just fine! Been all over today, and you wouldn't believe the cool stuff I did!
FO300021345	It's always nicer to be in here than out there.
FO300021346	I'm fine.
FO300021347	I think I'm catching a cough. But I'll be fine.

FO300021362	Hrmf. What're you so happy about?
FO300021363	Beat it, squirt.
FO300021364	How do, pal?
FO300021365	How do ya do, pal?
FO300021366	Hewwo. How're you?
FO300021367	Hey, how are you?
FO300021368	Now, fool, tremble before the might of the AntAgonizer!
FO300021369	You'll never get away with terrorizing this town. Not while it's under the protection of the Mechanist!
FO300021370	You and your pathetic tin cans are no match for my army! Muahahaha!
FO300021371	The citizens of this town have nothing to fear! The Mechanist is here to protect them!
FO300021372	Ha! We'll see about that! Attack, my ant soldiers! Destroy this fool and his tin toys!
FO300021373	Go forth, my steadfast creations! Show these vermin humanity's true power!
FO300021374	Face it, Mechanist! Humans and their toys are done for. They killed themselves off with their petty wars!
FO300021375	Humans may be weak sometimes, but our creations are strong and pure. Something you'll never be!
FO300021376	Fool! Humanity's creations were the seeds of their undoing. And now, the world will belong to the AntAgonizer!
FO300021377	Not while the world is protected by me, the Mechanist! Your reign of terror is at an end!
FO300021378	Well, so's your face!
FO300021379	You're insane, kid.
FO300021380	Fine. You're a man who puts his own business before that of others. I can understand that. But, if you change your mind. You let me know.
FO300021381	Maybe later. I've got things to attend to.
FO300021382	You think they're neat too, huh? It's not like they ever hurt anyone. Well not, like, really badly hurt, or anything.
FO300021383	Dom and Machete make sure everyone gets inside when they fight like that. Though sometimes I sneak out to watch!
FO300021384	The traders and the Slavers and the Raiders, they don't like the AntAgonizer or the Mechanist. They say they're "bad for business."
FO300021385	But that's dumb. The ants and the robots rip 'em to shreds. That shows them!
FO300021386	Those guys must really liven the place up, huh? Anyone ever get hurt?
FO300021387	Great! I'm relieved to know the situation will be quickly resolved. Let me know if I can be of assistance to you.
FO300021388	Oh, and please, do try to use some discretion. We already have plenty of would-be heroes starting wars in the streets. We don't need another.
FO300021389	I'll do it.
FO300021390	Yeah, I guess. There's no one to play with. Everyone is so serious. It really kinda sucks.
FO300021391	But the AntAgonizer's strong and forceful, and the Mechanist, he's smart and good. They make things fun. Well, exciting anyway.
FO300021392	I bet it's awesome to be them. Maybe they'll let me be their sidekick?
FO300021393	Life around here is pretty hard, huh?
FO300021394	Hmm. You drive a hard bargain friend. But seeing how we haven't been able to solve the problem ourselves, fine. You got a deal. But I expect results!
FO300021395	Oh, and please, do try to use some discretion. We already have plenty of would-be heroes starting wars in our streets. We don't need another.
FO300021396	Double that, and you've got yourself a deal.
FO300021397	No way, they're awesome! And their suits are really cool, too!
FO300021398	The AntAgonizer's got this army of ants, and the Mechanist has an army of robots and then they fight!
FO300021399	But my uncle never lets me watch them. He says it's dangerous. "This is serious business, Derek." Pft.
FO300021400	Are those jokers for real? What's up with the silly costumes?
FO300021401	Well, I suppose that's something. Canterbury Commons is known for its trading supplies. For now, at least.
FO300021402	Enjoy your stay. But if you find yourself low on caps, my offer still stands.
FO300021403	I don't give a damn. I'm interested in finding supplies.
FO300021404	You sound like Uncle Roe. He never lets me watch when they fight.
FO300021405	They're just about the only exciting thing that ever happens in this town.
FO300021406	This is serious business. You could get hurt. What do you know about them?
FO300021407	200 caps, if you can find where the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist hide, and convince them to stop their rivalry or otherwise stop fighting.
FO300021408	You only need to stop one of them, really. Nowadays, I think they only stay in Canterbury to fight each other. So, what do you say?
FO300021409	How much would a solution be worth to you?
FO300021410	The AntAgonizer, she's this evil supervillain who's trying to wipe out humans with her ants. And the Mechanist protects us with his robots!
FO300021411	And when they fight in town, it's incredible! There's all these lasers and biting and blood and it's crazy!
FO300021412	And then my uncle says I need to stay inside. He says it's dangerous. "This is serious business, Derek." Pft.
FO300021413	Yeah, I saw it. What can you tell me about them?
FO300021414	Oh that's terrific! I knew you'd help out. Knew it in my gut, and it's never steered me wrong on a deal, yet!
FO300021415	Find where the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist hide, and convince them to stop or otherwise end their hostility, and you'll earn 200 caps.
FO300021416	You only need to stop one of them, really. Nowadays, I think they only stay in Canterbury to fight each other.
FO300021417	I might be able to help.
FO300021418	That's ridiculous. I'm not paying you that much!
FO300021419	Fine. Let's all burn in Hell, then.
FO300021420	Just kidding! The code is 2-1-6.
FO300021421	Your sense of humor sucks.
FO300021422	Fine, 2-1-6. I got it. Guess I'll see you around.
FO300021423	You know what? I'm not telling you.
FO300021424	What? Are you out of your mind? We'll both die if this thing doesn't get turned on.
FO300021425	Who knows how many other people will die too. Give me the damn code!
FO300021426	The code is 2-1-6.
FO300021427	All right.
FO300021428	I'll see you in hell, coward.
FO300021429	Okay, I got it.
FO300021430	I guess if this doesn't work, we're screwed anyway, right?
FO300021431	Okay, I got it.
FO300021432	I wish that were true. Really, I do. But you heard Doctor Li. We have to do this right now, or who knows how bad it'll be.
FO300021433	One of us has to go in there.
FO300021434	The hell with this. This is crazy!
FO300021435	I'm not arguing, believe me.
FO300021436	But one of us has to go in there now. We don't have time to stand around and talk about it. Who's it going to be?
FO300021437	Ha! No way am I going in there. You do it.
FO300021438	You're getting cold feet now? So much for being a hero.
FO300021439	Fine, I'll do it. But I need the code.
FO300021440	So that's how it is? So much for chivalry.
FO300021441	Fine, I'll do it. But I need the code.
FO300021442	I'll do it. I'll start the purifier.
FO300021443	You're going to have to be quick about it. If the radiation is bad enough, you won't have much time.
FO300021444	I won't forget what you've done here. No one will. Thank you.
FO300021445	You need to hurry up. We're running out of time.
FO300021446	I said I'd do it, didn't I? I'll take care of it.
FO300021447	Okay, if you're sure. We don't have time to keep going back and forth on this.
FO300021448	Just do it quickly, before the radiation gets to be too much for you.
FO300021449	I changed my mind. I'll put the code in.
FO300021450	I'm sorry. I wish there were some other way, but there's just no time. It has to be done now, or the damage will be catastrophic.
FO300021451	If I'm reading this right, I'm afraid there are lethal levels of radiation inside the chamber.
FO300021452	To release the pressure, you're going to have to turn the purifier on. Do you understand me? It has to be turned on NOW.
FO300021453	There's pressure building up in the holding tanks. It needs to be released now, or else the whole facility could explode.
FO300021454	The facility has been damaged during the fighting. Some of it looks accidental; some of it may have been sabotage.
FO300021455	I've been monitoring the equipment remotely, and we have a serious problem.
FO300021456	Doctor Li? It's Sarah Lyons. I'm in the control room; we're both here. What's going on?
FO300021457	What do you want with me?
FO300021458	What any good politician wants. Your continued trust and support.
FO300021459	In your case, however, I have more specific things to ask of you, if you'll hear me out.
FO300021460	I love you Diego.
FO300021461	I love you too, Angela.
FO300021462	Okay. Thanks anyway.
FO300021463	You understand. I have enough to worry about already.
FO300021464	Come on, isn't there anything you can do to help?
FO300021465	I suppose I can spare a few stimpaks. It's not much, but it might make things easier for you.
FO300021466	Why are you standing around? Get in there!
FO300021467	We're almost out of time. Please start up the purifier before we're all killed.
FO300021468	We're running out of time. You need to get in there.
FO300021469	Please tell me the code!
FO300021470	Don't let things end like this. Not now, not after all we've been through.
FO300021471	I need the code. Please tell me what it is.
FO300021472	Please, we're running out of time!
FO300021473	Sharp knife. Sharp knife to send him to deep temple. Flay and say my words. Abdul comes again, on the feast of the weaker. Feast for the Deep Temple.
FO300021474	Born again, here. Alhazzared G’yeth G’yeth.
FO300021475	DunwichJaimesHoloEntry08
FO300021476	Didn't know it was him until I found that old book near him. No more killing. I just need to go. Can't forget the book. All I have left of him.
FO300021477	The Raiders told spook stories about zombies in the ruins. Never saw anything like that where I come from, but Lord help me, they're real.
FO300021478	DunwichJaimesHoloEntry06
FO300021479	Don't want to risk a shot at the crows until I know what’s in there. Sneaking in tonight.
FO300021480	DunwichJaimesHoloEntry05
FO300021481	He must have been trying to trap food here. I recognize his snares.  I can make out a building on the horizon. That must be where he headed.
FO300021482	If not, at least I get a roof tonight.
FO300021483	DunwichJaimesHoloEntry04
FO300021484	Hit a caravan today. Trev didn't see the kid and got popped. I took care of Tawny right then, and put one in Thor before he saw her fall.
FO300021485	That earned me some grub from the traders. Even better, they saw dad.  He was in pretty rough shape, and still has the goddamn book.
FO300021486	Trader says it gave him the creeps. Me too. But it's good to know he's still alive. Still headed south.
FO300021487	These guys aren't who I thought they were. Jesus, they killed that family for a sack of rotten vegetables.
FO300021488	Getting out of here next chance I can without catching a bullet.
FO300021489	Maybe I shouldn't have waited so damn long to start tracking him. Trail's gone cold. Going to wander with these guys a while.
FO300021490	Why the hell would he come all the way out here? Dad's been a little nuts for some time now, but not like this.
FO300021491	I made enough selling the meds we scrounged to have kept us both fed at the colony for weeks.
FO300021492	Now I'm almost out of rations, my shoes are pretty much destroyed, and I'm still chasing the old coot. By my last reckoning, he was headed south.
FO300021493	Did I make a bunch of really lame jokes?
FO300021494	Yeah, that'd be my twin sister, Knock Knock. I'm Knick Knack. I got my nickname first, and she copied it.
FO300021495	Anyway, I run the town store. Or at least the pile of stuff that we've collected. If you're ever looking to trade, just ask.
FO300021496	Didn't I just meet you?
FO300021497	Was I all obsessed with stuff and toys?
FO300021498	Yeah, that'd be my twin brother, Knick Knack. I'm Knock Knock. He got the nickname first, and I improved on it.
FO300021499	Anyway, I keep folks entertained. Or at least, I tell them the jokes and stories we've got. If you're ever looking to laugh, just ask!
FO300021500	Didn't I just meet you?
FO300021501	I know they aren't very funny. But that was a bit uncalled for.
FO300021502	Most of them came from a book we found long ago in the vault, "Vault Boy's Big Book of Laughs for Kids."
FO300021503	They're pretty dumb, but we all know them, and they're just kind of comforting. Sort of familiar, see?
FO300021504	That couldn't have been a joke. Jokes are supposed to be funny.
FO300021505	That's only because you haven't heard all of the jokes from the book. Like this gem, "What's big, and red, and beats rocks?"
FO300021506	"A big, red, rock-beater." Seriously.
FO300021507	See? Now that's the dumbest thing you've ever heard!
FO300021508	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
FO300021509	Oh, we've got lots of funny incidents. Like when Sammy shot the Raider who thought he was a girl, that sort of stuff.
FO300021510	But we don't really get a lot of new stories from outside. The scav teams spend all their time hidden, so they don't get much news, see?
FO300021511	I'd sure like to hear more tales from the great big outdoors, myself. Actually, if you hear any, feel free to tell me!
FO300021512	Why don't you come up with new jokes or stories to tell?
FO300021513	LLKnockJokes2B
FO300021514	Gee, thanks! I have to admit, most of them aren't really funny. At least, not ha-ha funny.
FO300021515	They're more like a tradition. Most of them were passed down from this book we found down back, called "Vault Boy's Big Book of Laughs for Kids".
FO300021516	They're not really funny, but something about hearing them is a little comforting, you know?
FO300021517	Whoa, you really think so? Like, actually funny? Can you convince other folks to find them funny?
FO300021518	Actually, most of our jokes are from an old book we found in the vault, called "Vault Boy's Big Book of Laughs for Kids."
FO300021519	They're not really funny, but something about hearing them is a little comforting, you know?
FO300021520	That was hysterical!
FO300021521	LLStanAboutCaps3B
FO300021522	I know. And really, we're lucky we didn't lose more people in that attack.
FO300021523	But we can't risk that a second time. I've got to stay extra vigilant on watch. Thanks for reminding me of that.
FO300021524	Now leave me alone. No distractions!
FO300021525	Sounds like it was your fault Caps died. Guards can't slack like that.
FO300021526	LLStanAboutCaps3A
FO300021527	Somebody needs to guard the front gate, and no one else is doing it. So I will. Even if it sucks for me, I don't mind.
FO300021528	Some things just have to be done, and they just have to be done right. Because if they aren't, you can't ever get back what you lose.
FO300021529	Besides, Caps would want it like that.
FO300021530	You're going to stand guard all alone from now on? Quite a sacrifice, Stacey.
FO300021531	LLStanAboutCaps2B
FO300021532	No. Not anymore, they don't.
FO300021533	Now, stop distracting me from my job.
FO300021534	That's the way things go, you know?
FO300021535	LLStanAboutCaps2A
FO300021536	It really is my fault she died.
FO300021537	Now I'm the only front gate guard, so it's my responsibility to make up for that.
FO300021538	You can't blame yourself for her death.
FO300021539	Why? Because I'm the Princess of Little Lamplight?
FO300021540	I know why you're really called Princess, Princess.
FO300021541	So, a long time ago, Princess convinced everyone that she should be mayor.
FO300021542	The first thing she did as mayor was try to insist that the title be changed to "Princess".
FO300021543	It was 5 minutes before MacCready punched her in the nose and got picked as the new mayor. It was awesome!
FO300021544	Can you tell me why Princess gets angry about her nickname?
FO300021545	So, a long time ago, Princess convinced everyone that she should be mayor.
FO300021546	The first thing she did as mayor was try to insist that the title be changed to "Princess".
FO300021547	It was 5 minutes before MacCready punched her in the nose and got picked as the new mayor. It was awesome!
FO300021548	Can you tell me why Princess gets angry about her nickname?
FO300021549	No. We'll see how I feel about it tomorrow, huh?
FO300021550	Can you tell me why Princess gets angry about her nickname?
FO300021551	That's all I need to know for now.
FO300021552	Well, until you come asking for a bandage, at least.
FO300021553	That's all I need to know for now.
FO300021554	Glad I could help.
FO300021555	That's all I need to know for now.
FO300021556	Sure.
FO300021557	That's all I need to know for now.
FO300021558	About time.
FO300021559	That's all I need to know for now.
FO300021560	Let me think about it and get back to you on that.
FO300021561	LLFungusDeal2B
FO300021562	Oh, is that how it's going to be, then? Well then, how's this deal?
FO300021563	Rather than you wasting the explosives to try to close all of our exits, just for us to burrow out again, you get my private stash of fungus. Here.
FO300021564	But I wouldn't expect much goodwill in town after this, you shit-sucking mungo bastard.
FO300021565	Give me the fungus, or I'll seal this place underground. And you with it.
FO300021566	For every piece of strange meat or Buffout you bring in, you'll be repaid with one cube of fungus. You couldn't ask for a better deal.
FO300021567	Talk with Eclair for the strange meat, or to Lucy about the Buffout. They've got uses for them.
FO300021568	I bring in needed supplies, and I get some of the fungus in return.
FO300021569	That's not a terrible deal. And it'd mean more of those dumbasses can stay safely down here, instead of scavving all the time.
FO300021570	Okay, for every two bits of strange meat or Buffout, I'll make sure you get a piece of fungus. Not too bad, huh?
FO300021571	I'll spread the word to and Lucy and Eclair. They've got uses for them, so they'll make the trade, and we'll all be happy, okay?
FO300021572	I bring in needed supplies, and I get some of the fungus in return.
FO300021573	More stuff for us, and more chance of you getting shot, stumbling back here, choking on your own blood while we point and laugh? Sounds good.
FO300021574	How about this: for every three pieces of strange meat or Buffout doses you bring in, you'll get one piece of fungus. Take it or leave it.
FO300021575	Just talk to Lucy or Eclair about what they need, and stop bothering me about it.
FO300021576	I bring in needed supplies, and I get some of the fungus in return.
FO300021577	Sure, right. And we'll just trust you to bring us plenty of clean food and medicine, and not to try to poison us and move in on your own.
FO300021578	No, no deal, mungo. This is our fungus, and we haven't got enough to share with freaks like you.
FO300021579	I bring in needed supplies, and I get some of the fungus in return.
FO300021580	Yeah, I'll bet you've heard all about the "fungus in my cavern."
FO300021581	But yeah, the cave's fungus, sure. It's good for food and medicine, and it's the main fucking reason we've stayed alive down here.
FO300021582	So, you want a slice of that gray-green gold, huh? I think maybe we could come to an arrangement. What're you offering?
FO300021583	I've heard a lot about the fungus in your cavern, and I'd like to make a deal.
FO300021584	It is, especially for dealing with the low-level radiation we all get from the water. The fungus just soaks it right up.
FO300021585	But it doesn't help the rickets that keeps hitting younger Lamplighters. Believe it or not, I can make a treatment for that from extract of Buffout.
FO300021586	Actually, if you can talk MacCready into it, I'd be glad to trade some fungus for Buffout. But he'd have to say it was okay.
FO300021587	That sounds like it's pretty useful fungus.
FO300021588	We entered all of the books and holotapes into the computer, but frankly, there are a lot of important subjects the vault's materials didn't cover.
FO300021589	I could wish for more, but we're probably still the best school in the Wasteland. Maybe the only school in the Wasteland, really.
FO300021590	How thorough are your teaching materials?
FO300021591	They say the fungus grows in the pools where the first Lamplighters dumped the mungos. That's about the most they ever helped us.
FO300021592	I don't know how true that is, but I know sometimes the scav team comes back with this strange meat that tastes terrible, but the fungus loves it.
FO300021593	I don't know where they find that meat, but if you could bring some back, I'd be glad to trade fungus for it. Of course, MacCready'd have to okay it.
FO300021594	How does the fungus grow?
FO300021595	People change when they grow up, and we don't trust mungos living down here. So we leave for a place called Big Town before we get too old.
FO300021596	At least, that's the line Joseph teaches. But, really, we simply don't have enough space or food for everyone to stay here forever.
FO300021597	So I've got to exile some to avoid ruining the whole town. It's a fucking hard brutal choice to make, but that's the way we stay alive.
FO300021598	You said everyone has to leave eventually?
FO300021599	People change when they grow up, and we don't trust mungos living down here. So we leave for a place called Big Town before we get too old.
FO300021600	Kids who grow up fighting and surviving in Lamplight are better trained for the world out there than idiots who were pampered by grown-ups outside.
FO300021601	You said everyone has to leave eventually?
FO300021602	LLAboutLamplight2A
FO300021603	Well, we all know the basics. Combat first aid, you know? But I've got the most experience at the tough stuff.
FO300021604	Bumble's been learning the most about the more complex parts of cutting and sewing. People tease her, but she's got a steady hand.
FO300021605	Of course, now she just needs to learn what you do and don't cut.
FO300021606	So, you're the only doctor in this whole place?
FO300021607	Mostly, whatever they want to learn. We don't have strict classes or anything down here. But it does mean they're interested in what I'm teaching.
FO300021608	What do you teach the kids?
FO300021609	It's pretty hard to find, and I hear it doesn't grow in other caves. I don't know why it's here, but without it, we'd be goners.
FO300021610	"Think fungus just grows on trees? No, it grows in caves!" Ugh. Knock Knock came up with that one once, and now it's stuck in my head forever.
FO300021611	Doesn't take any work to get it to grow down here. All I have to do is collect and prepare it. Mostly, I try to get the stink off it.
FO300021612	Where does the fungus come from?
FO300021613	It's not that complex. Any kid can say they want to be mayor here. It's just that most don't want to bother with the responsibility of leading.
FO300021614	Most of the time, they last until the kids get tired of them, then they get kicked out on their ass by the new mayor. One only lasted 5 minutes.
FO300021615	Of course, I've kept this place going strong for three years. To most of these kids, that makes me Mayor For Fucking Life. Fine by me, I say.
FO300021616	How did you get to be in charge of this place?
FO300021617	Aw, come on. Knock knock!
FO300021618	No. I don't have time for funny business.
FO300021619	Prepare to be amused!
FO300021620	Knock knock!
FO300021621	Sure, let's hear one.
FO300021622	Oh, really? That's a cute little imagination you've got.
FO300021623	But if you want to play make-believe, maybe you should do it with the younger brats.
FO300021624	Shooting at me would have been a big mistake, kid.
FO300021625	Could've been a lot of reasons. Maybe you sounded like a monster in all that darkness.
FO300021626	Maybe you had a weapon drawn, and looked like a Raider.
FO300021627	Maybe I just decided I didn't like your stupid, mungo face.
FO300021628	Why would you have shot at me?
FO300021629	Caps used to take care of me. I would find hats for her collection. That's why she was called "Caps", right?
FO300021630	Before long, I was guarding the front gate with her. She liked the company. She liked the jokes I used to make. I think she liked me.
FO300021631	Caps? What do you mean?
FO300021632	There's always one big sister or another who knows her way around a compress and a sewing needle, so we take care of most of the little scrapes.
FO300021633	And way back when, someone figured out that some of the plants and fungus around here absorb radiation.
FO300021634	The little ones don't like to eat their veggies, but they don't like to be sick, either. So we get by.
FO300021635	How do you keep healthy here?
FO300021636	Well, back at the start, all the children had were the notes from the grown-ups that hadn't left yet, and a few books on caves from the store.
FO300021637	But after finding the vault, a few scavengers brought back holotapes for basic schooling. Reading, basic math, encyclopedias, that sort of thing.
FO300021638	We don't get many books anymore from the scav team, but I make sure to keep my own notes on the computer for whoever takes over after I leave.
FO300021639	What sort of education do the kids get in here?
FO300021640	Honestly? When we can't scavenge some from outside, we mostly scrape it off the walls and skim it off the water.
FO300021641	No, really. Most of our food comes from fungus that grows in these caves. It's not so bad when you get used to it, and we don't have much choice.
FO300021642	At least it's filling, so we don't have to eat much of it. But, man oh man, it tastes terrible.
FO300021643	Where do you get food for this place?
FO300021644	Organized?! Have you walked around this place? It's pure anarchy! And I wouldn't have it any other fucking way.
FO300021645	We can't all stay here forever, so we've all got to leave eventually. And there's not much to look forward to out there.
FO300021646	So we have a good time while we're here, and the occasional ruthless little bastard like me makes sure it doesn't fall apart for the other kids.
FO300021647	How do you keep this place organized?
FO300021648	Before we talk about that, do you have my reward?
FO300021649	Wow. You sound like one of the guys from Talon Company. Ruthless bastard, aren't you?
FO300021650	You can act badass all day, doesn't phase me. You're chicken shit compared to some of the guys I've dealt with.
FO300021651	To answer your question, yeah, I got your damn reward. Now, how about that debrief?
FO300021652	No way, pal. No fucking way.
FO300021653	I do things by the book. My book. It may seem stupid to you, but it's all we got. So when I ask for a debrief, I want a goddamn debrief!
FO300021654	Give me the reward first. Then we'll talk.
FO300021655	My point is that your government isn't legitimate. You have no right to rule.
FO300021656	I see.
FO300021657	And what of the chain of command? When the Enclave fell on the west coast, Eden was next in line for leadership.
FO300021658	It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. President.
FO300021659	You are too kind. The pleasure is mine, I assure you. I have been anxious to make your acquaintance for some time.
FO300021660	You and I have much to discuss, my young friend.
FO300021661	I remember asking Flash the same thing when I was your age. He said he was going to Big Town, and I'd see him again when I grew up and left, myself.
FO300021662	Well, when Lamplighters get older, we move out to Big Town. It's a happy place, where we aren't making the mistakes other grown ups have made.
FO300021663	I've got the scav team looking for that, but Eclair's after me for more food and Joseph wants more fucking books, so they're pretty busy.
FO300021664	We're working on it, Lucy, we really fucking are. More than Eclair's food and Joseph's precious books, at least. Just keep 'em from dirting out.
FO300021665	What's going to happen when you get too old and have to leave Lamplight?
FO300021666	You're the oldest kid in Lamplight. What's going to happen when you have to leave?
FO300021667	I'm still seeing the same sorts of cases. Stubbed toes, bloody noses, a few stabbings. We could really use more medicine, though.
FO300021668	Things are okay on my end, but I'm still worried about some of the younger ones. We really need more medicine for some of them.
FO300021669	Any time, dear. What's wrong?
FO300021670	Certainly! What's on your mind?
FO300021671	Well, we ain't all dead yet, so I guess I'm doing okay. You haven't killed anybody lately either, so that's good too.
FO300021672	No one's on fire or bleeding or anything, right? That's about as much as we can fucking expect. How about you?
FO300021673	Big brother, can I ask you something?
FO300021674	Big brother, there's something I'd like to know.
FO300021675	So, how's everything going, big, scary, mayor-man?
FO300021676	So, been having a good time yelling at everyone, RJ? Standard life of a mayor?
FO300021677	Hey, down there!
FO300021678	Hey, Princess, stop thinking about how dreamy I am and pay attention to guarding!
FO300021679	LLTwinsConv4
FO300021680	You better believe it, sis! Later!
FO300021681	Great stuff! Talk with you later, sis!
FO300021682	That's hysterical! Zip was running around, checking every rock he found all day!
FO300021683	Oh man, and just yesterday I got him to believe one of the rocks out back granted wishes! I guess we make a good team, even when we didn't mean to!
FO300021684	LLTwinsConv2
FO300021685	Do I ever? How about you? Made any good trades today?
FO300021686	Not if I could help it! Made any good trades today?
FO300021687	So, sis, make any good jokes today?
FO300021688	So, bro, made any good trades today?
FO300021689	Someday, you're gonna get yours, Princess.
FO300021690	Big jerk.
FO300021691	LLBackGateConv3
FO300021692	If you don't get me a new gun next time you're topside, I'm gonna pound you so hard you'll get another inch shorter.
FO300021693	You getting a nickname any time soon? Maybe you can get one that helps people figure out you're not a girl.
FO300021694	What?
FO300021695	Yeah?
FO300021696	Hey, squirt! Hey, look at me when I talk to you.
FO300021697	Hey, little Miss Sammy! Pay attention!
FO300021698	There's an old vault record that sounds similar. Apparently, if you don't eat enough, you get weakened by things called "rickets."
FO300021699	Sounds like they aren't eating enough, but I can't really be sure. Most of the vault health books only care about "proper hygiene."
FO300021700	I've been seeing a few cases of bent bones and weak teeth in some of the younger ones. Any clue in those books about what it could be?
FO300021701	Some of the younger kids have been having muscle weakness and are a little soft in the head. Is there anything in the old records about that?
FO300021702	Sure thing, Lucy. What do you need?
FO300021703	Absolutely. What's the question?
FO300021704	Joseph, can I ask you a question?
FO300021705	Joseph, can I get your help with something?
FO300021706	I'll get the scav team on it. Maybe they can get you some fucking cheese to go along with your whine.
FO300021707	That's my best girl! Keep them alive and keep them in line!
FO300021708	Yeah, Knock, and you hardly count as that. Keep it up!
FO300021709	Okay, well if someone brings you a big, fuck-off death-ray, I call dibs, understand?
FO300021710	Well, keep it up, Joseph. And don't worry, if you lose any, I'm sure Eclair won't mind having one fewer damned mouth to feed.
FO300021711	Could you at least try to stay awake next time you're on watch?
FO300021712	Really? Would you rather scrape fungus with Eclair? And watch the goddamned language around Sammy, okay, shiteater?
FO300021713	Yes, sir. Food's running low, but we're scraping by, RJ. We could use more supplies from the outside, especially if you want something with a flavor.
FO300021714	Nothing much you'd be interested in. Still doing a brisk trade in some of the toys, though!
FO300021715	Going well, when there's anyone attending them. Basic survival and shooting lessons are good as always. Haven't lost any of them yet!
FO300021716	Everything's okay out back, Mayor. Same as ever.
FO300021717	All's clear on the back gate, RJ. No trouble, no action, no nothing. Most incredibly fucking boring job ever.
FO300021718	With a mouth as foul as mine, your shitty cooking fits right in.
FO300021719	LLFoodConv2
FO300021720	Now you're just making up words, aren't you? Here's your standard.
FO300021721	So, cave fungus in sauce? Coming right up.
FO300021722	Just like you're keeping them alive, Lucy. Here you go.
FO300021723	Sure thing, dear.
FO300021724	Nice try, but you're still getting the same muck as everyone else.
FO300021725	Hell, I'd be happy with a clean set of spoons. Enjoy the meal.
FO300021726	Yeah, yeah, I know. Here's your "fun-guy." Should be as good as your jokes.
FO300021727	Yeah, yeah, I get it, Zip. Here, knock yourself out.
FO300021728	Calm down, Zip. It's not getting any blander. Here.
FO300021729	Sure thing, Penny.
FO300021730	Toughen up, Squirrel. The dirt adds flavor.
FO300021731	I can't believe you like this shit, RJ.
FO300021732	Just like you're keeping them alive, Lucy. Here you go.
FO300021733	Here. Now, get.
FO300021734	You know it, Eclair. Keeping the masses fed?
FO300021735	Ill have your finest mycelium, cubed and served in a savory sauce, Eclair.
FO300021736	A plate of your excellently prepared mycorrhizae, Eclair!
FO300021737	Food, please!
FO300021738	Hey, Eclair! What do you call a mushroom that knows how to party?
FO300021739	You know, Eclair, if I ever get a microwave oven, it's going right to you.
FO300021740	Got any food for me today? Because I'm really in a hurry and I really don't have time to come back later so how about some food right now?
FO300021741	May I have some food, please?
FO300021742	Can I have mine without much dirt on it? I think I'm allergic.
FO300021743	Hit me with some of that grub, fat man!
FO300021744	Gimme some food!
FO300021745	I'm hungry! Feed me!
FO300021746	Well, when we grow up too big, we need to go outside, where there's more space. That's why we go to Big Town, where we meet again as grown-ups.
FO300021747	Yes, teacher.
FO300021748	I know, I know.
FO300021749	Thank goodness we're safe in here. We've got food, water, and most importantly, we watch out for each other. Does that make sense, Bumble?
FO300021750	Things outside are very dangerous indeed, and that's why we fight so hard to keep our Little Lamplight caverns safe and free. Understand, Bumble?
FO300021751	LLClassConv3
FO300021752	People don't have the same sort of safety and freedom to run around and play like you can here. They have to work hard for food and safety.
FO300021753	Well, then why you do have to go to Big Town when you grow up?
FO300021754	Then why don't we let people stay here when they grow up?
FO300021755	So I'll just hit the basics: treat every gun as if it's loaded, never point a gun at someone you don't plan on killing, and keep your ammo dry.
FO300021756	So just remember the basics: guns aren't toys for playing with. Only use them to shoot people you want to kill. Anything else is a waste of ammo.
FO300021757	Penny, please. Now, as I was saying. Outside of this cave, the world is a lot bigger and more dangerous than it is in here.
FO300021758	Sure, Bumble. Outside of this cave, the world is a lot bigger and more dangerous than it is in here. It's also got people who would hurt or kill us.
FO300021759	Okay, Bumble, one more time. Outside of these caves, the world is hot, dry, and not very friendly. And there are monsters bigger than you or me.
FO300021760	Well, it's really not something to be afraid of, Penny, despite what some say. You do get bigger and stronger, but it doesn't really make you stupid.
FO300021761	Well, Penny, despite the stories, it's not really something to be scared of. We all do it, assuming we don't get ourselves killed, first.
FO300021762	Honestly, Sammy, I think you know more than me at this point! I've heard some of the stories about you out on those scavenging trips, you know.
FO300021763	Well, I think at this point, you'd be better at teaching that than I would! Eclair says you're an even better sharpshooter than he was.
FO300021764	LLClassConv1
FO300021765	Uncle Joseph, could you explain more about the outside?
FO300021766	Uncle Joseph, I still don't understand what outside's like. Can you explain more?
FO300021767	Can you tell me more about growing up, big brother?
FO300021768	Joseph, what happens when a person grows up?
FO300021769	I wanna know more about shooting.
FO300021770	Anything you can teach me about shooting, Joseph?
FO300021771	Then, if you'll excuse me, I should get back to the rest of class.
FO300021772	No, I don't need to hear anything right now.
FO300021773	Okay. Sit back, and I'll retell the history of our fine town to the entire class.
FO300021774	Can I hear how Little Lamplight got started?
FO300021775	Oh, come on! Please? I promise not to interrupt!
FO300021776	Well, if you feel like telling me more, you know where to find me.
FO300021777	You'll have to wait. Storytime's over for now.
FO300021778	Well, I gotta admit, the ending to a story's pretty important.
FO300021779	Well, if you ever want to share it, I'm right here!
FO300021780	Maybe later. I don't know the ending, yet.
FO300021781	So, you're like a three-legged dog, then?
FO300021782	Looking for your lost paw?
FO300021783	Hah! Anyway, what happened next?
FO300021784	Not long ago, my father left me. So I went searching for him.
FO300021785	I mean, that is to say, I'm real sorry to hear about your loss.
FO300021786	So, what happens next?
FO300021787	I finally found Dad, but then he died protecting me and his life's work.
FO300021788	Inheriting the family business, huh? Congrats!
FO300021789	I sure hope it works out! You'll let me know, right?
FO300021790	Now I finally have a chance to finish Dad's legacy and revive the Wasteland.
FO300021791	Oh, you'll see, don't worry.
FO300021792	I sure hope so. Good luck!
FO300021793	You'll hear all about it, don't worry.
FO300021794	That makes sense, I suppose. A good story can take a while to put together, you know?
FO300021795	I'd tell you more, but I'm still working on how it ends.
FO300021796	Oh, really? Tell me all about it!
FO300021797	I've got a tale I could tell you.
FO300021798	Am I ever! Let's hear it!
FO300021799	There's more to my story, if you're interested.
FO300021800	Like crazy! Spill, spill!
FO300021801	Want to hear the rest of my story?
FO300021802	Just shut up! This isn't fair! A big, mean mungo is picking on me! I hate you!
FO300021803	Just leave me alone! Go away! Go!
FO300021804	This bunch of idiots don't deserve me leading them!
FO300021805	They wouldn't know a real boss if one shot them in the ass!
FO300021806	Couldn't even handle the job for five minutes, huh?
FO300021807	Oh, sure, like I should believe you. Why are you even wasting your time over here?
FO300021808	Scram, get out of my face, go!
FO300021809	Yeah, well... You're a jerk and MacCready doesn't like you.
FO300021810	That's not true! You're a liar! Shut your stupid face, liar!
FO300021811	I know RJ likes me! He really does! Really!
FO300021812	Just leave me alone, you mungo jerk! I hate you!
FO300021813	Really? Funny how he spends most of his time with Lucy, then.
FO300021814	That isn't so! Stop lying! Stop being such a big mungo liar!
FO300021815	This isn't fair! A big mean mungo picking on me! I hate you!
FO300021816	"Best friend"? You haven't got friends, Princess. Not RJ, not Sammy, not anyone.
FO300021817	That's right! Run away, coward!
FO300021818	You know what? Never mind. It's not worth making you cry.
FO300021819	Thanks. Maybe you can take her down a peg, huh?
FO300021820	Thanks, Sammy. That's useful information.
FO300021821	No way. I think she's got a crush on him. She's all weird for him.
FO300021822	Does she still hold a grudge against them?
FO300021823	Oh yeah? Well that was a long time ago! Now RJ's my best friend!
FO300021824	Someday, we're gonna be boyfriend and girlfriend, and then he'll kick you out!
FO300021825	I hear MacCready really walloped you when you tried to play princess.
FO300021826	Yeah! MacCready said we needed someone to watch out for us, not to lord over us. Then he popped her one! She hasn't even tried since then.
FO300021827	That's why he stays mayor, too. I hope I can be that cool, someday.
FO300021828	She was only mayor for five minutes?
FO300021829	Shut up! Soon as I figure out who told you, someone's getting pounded into the ground.
FO300021830	That was a long time ago, anyway!
FO300021831	You don't have to be embarrassed by it. Not everyone can be a good mayor.
FO300021832	I'm not telling you the fucking code.
FO300021833	How can you do this?
FO300021834	I have 20 to sell.
FO300021835	The more of these I get, the longer I can keep the plant going.
FO300021836	Seems like we can never have enough of these.
FO300021837	We can always use 'em.
FO300021838	Actually, never mind.
FO300021839	Actually, I don't have any parts to sell.
FO300021840	You sure? Okay well, if you change your mind, just let me know.
FO300021841	I have 25 to sell.
FO300021842	The more of these I get, the longer I can keep the plant going.
FO300021843	Seems like we can never have enough of these.
FO300021844	We can always use 'em.
FO300021845	I have 15 to sell.
FO300021846	The more of these I get, the longer I can keep the plant going.
FO300021847	Seems like we can never have enough of these.
FO300021848	We can always use 'em.
FO300021849	I have 5 to sell.
FO300021850	The more of these I get, the longer I can keep the plant going.
FO300021851	Seems like we can never have enough of these.
FO300021852	We can always use 'em.
FO300021853	I have 10 to sell.
FO300021854	The more of these I get, the longer I can keep the plant going.
FO300021855	Seems like we can never have enough of these.
FO300021856	We can always use 'em.
FO300021857	Interested in buying some scrap metal?
FO300021858	I sure am, sonny. What've you got for me?
FO300021859	I sure am, missy. What've you got for me?
FO300021860	What can I do to help around here?
FO300021861	Well, it's no secret that the ol' water treatment plant is on its last legs. And I'm the only one in town that can keep the damn thing running.
FO300021862	I spend so much time up in the plant, that I can't take care of the leaks that keep springing up in the pipes around town.
FO300021863	Now, I don't expect much from strangers, but if you've got the knowhow, I need someone to hunt down and repair those leaks.
FO300021864	The pipes are leaking around town. Find the leaks and patch the pipes, if you can. There should be three leaks.
FO300021865	What did you need me to do again?
FO300021866	The pipes are leaking around town. Find the leaks and patch the pipes, if you can. My guess is that there are still two leaks out there.
FO300021867	What did you need me to do again?
FO300021868	The pipes are leaking around town. Find the leaks and patch the pipes, if you can. There's only one more leak. Be sure to check all the pipes.
FO300021869	What did you need me to do again?
FO300021870	But listen, it's only a matter of time before they burst again, and someone like you might not be around to fix 'em. I'll make you a deal.
FO300021871	I'll give you caps for any Scrap Metal you can bring me. You'll find 'em it over the place out there in the Wastes.
FO300021872	If I have a steady supply of scrap, I can keep the plant running and the pipes should be just fine. We got a deal?
FO300021873	The pipes are all fixed.
FO300021874	Just take all the scrap metal I have. No charge. I just want to help
FO300021875	Sounds good to me. I'll bring you the parts I find.
FO300021876	Good! This just keeps looking better! Those parts will keep this place running and the town in fresh water! Hurry back as soon as you find some!
FO300021877	I'm not your errand boy. Just pay me for the repairs.
FO300021878	But what do you care? You just want your money. Here, take it and get out.
FO300021879	I'll keep it in mind.
FO300021880	Can't you fix the pipes?
FO300021881	I could, but I can't hunt for leaks all damn day. That rust bucket purifier would fall apart without me up around to plug it up.
FO300021882	The only break I get is when I shut the thing off for the night, and I can't look for leaks when the water isn't running.
FO300021883	How many leaks are there?
FO300021884	From the pressure in the plant, my guess is that there are three of 'em scattered around town.
FO300021885	Check along the pipes and the valves, but they might be a bit tricky to spot.
FO300021886	Just take all the scrap metal I have.
FO300021887	I'll give you the suit. No one ever has to see the AntAgonizer again. Just please, let me have another chance.
FO300021888	We all make mistakes, but there's still a chance for us. I believe in you.
FO300021889	I'll give you the suit. No one ever has to see the AntAgonizer again. Just please, let me have another chance.
FO300021890	Humanity's made mistakes, but there's still a chance for us. And for you, Tanya.
FO300021891	Am I really the villain, here? Does this mean I should stop myself?
FO300021892	Here, please. Take the suit. I don't want to think about it anymore.
FO300021893	Darling, your fighting is scaring the whole town. Won't you stop for me?
FO300021894	Am I really the villain, here? Does this mean I should stop myself?
FO300021895	Here, please. Take the suit. I don't want to think about it anymore.
FO300021896	Your fighting is scaring people in town, and it might hurt little Derek.
FO300021897	Am I really the villain, here? Does this mean I should stop myself?
FO300021898	Here, please. Take the suit. I don't want to think about it anymore.
FO300021899	The fighting is causing more trouble for the town than the AntAgonizer ever did.
FO300021900	But I'll snuff those chances soon enough. Now, my royal guard, kill this commoner!
FO300021901	Humanity's made mistakes, but there's still a chance for us.
FO300021902	Tell you what. You tell me first, and I'll consider taking the tour.
FO300021903	Well, I suppose. I really wanted you to see the tour, but you seem nice enough.
FO300021904	Ever hear of Nuka-Cola Quantum?
FO300021905	I'm looking to make some cash. Any opportunities here?
FO300021906	Actually, there may be. Tell you what, you take the tour of my collection and I promise to give you a proposition you won't want to say no to.
FO300021907	So, do you want to take it?
FO300021908	No reason. I was just passing through.
FO300021909	Oh. Well that's silly.
FO300021910	If you don't want to see my collection then there really isn't anything else to see here.
FO300021911	Unless you think broken bridges are scenic.
FO300021912	Sierra! Please. I get it. He's tough.
FO300021913	Oh. Sorry! I get carried away sometimes.
FO300021914	Well, you should definitely talk to Ronald. I bet he'd like to meet you. He's such a sweetheart.
FO300021915	Then the other one tried to like hit him all in his head with some club and Ronald was so cool how he dodged it and shot the guy in the face.
FO300021916	Yeah, he sounds great. So, you mentioned a tour or something?
FO300021917	I sure did! Want to take it now?
FO300021918	How can you resist? This stuff is so cool!
FO300021919	Tell me more about this Ronald guy.
FO300021920	He's a darling. Always watching out for me, and more importantly keeping the collection safe!
FO300021921	I think you're crazy.
FO300021922	Sure am! Crazy for the taste of Nuka-Cola! Hahahaha!
FO300021923	Look, we can just talk about it all day, or you can take my tour of the place and drink some frosty Nuka-Cola! You game?
FO300021924	No, you're just thirsty! Come on, take a look at my collection and have an Ice Cold Nuka-Cola on me! Sound good?
FO300021925	Who's Ronald?
FO300021926	Ronald? Oh! I'm sorry, I figured you met him already. He usually chats with people who enter Girdershade.
FO300021927	He's such a sweetie, you should talk to him!
FO300021928	Ugh, that sounds really disgusting!
FO300021929	But Ronald said he liked it!
FO300021930	Wait a minute. How many members are in your club?
FO300021931	But membership is open to the public! You can join if you like!
FO300021932	What kind of stuff do you collect, exactly?
FO300021933	My pride and joy is my perfect Nuka-Cola Machine. It's barely even scratched!
FO300021934	Actually, I have to give credit to Ronald for donating some of it.
FO300021935	There's a Nuka-Cola Fan Club?
FO300021936	Yep, I'm the President, the Recording Secretary and the Treasurer.
FO300021937	Once a year, we gather here in Girdershade to have a cook off using Nuka-Cola in the recipe.
FO300021938	Last year I won with my "Poached Roach in Nuka-Sauce". Delicious!
FO300021939	Ugh! I hate Nuka-Cola. That stuff is disgusting.
FO300021940	Disgusting?!
FO300021941	It's the most delicious drinks ever created! It quenches your thirst, boosts your energy and even makes you smarter!
FO300021942	What's not to like about it?
FO300021943	Nope. I'm not really interested in seeing your collection.
FO300021944	Oh! Really? Wow.
FO300021945	Well, why did you come out here then?
FO300021946	Yes, of course!
FO300021947	Well, come on then! Let me show you around! But no free Nuka-Cola until the end of the tour!
FO300021948	Nuka-Cola collection? Wow!
FO300021949	I have one of the... no, THE best Nuka-Cola collection in the Capital Wasteland.
FO300021950	Heck, I've won the Nuka-Cola Fan Club Collection Award for the last ten years in a row!
FO300021951	How do I kill you?
FO300021952	That's quite a bold line of questioning.
FO300021953	I'm afraid such a thing is beyond your capability. I am quite impervious to any damage you might do.
FO300021954	Do you find this disappointing? I have survived the last two hundred years; I'm afraid you will not put an end to that now.
FO300021955	So what's your goal? What are you trying to accomplish?
FO300021956	I desire nothing more than to see this country returned to its former glory.
FO300021957	The United States was great once, and it can be again. There are plans in motion to see that this happens within your lifetime.
FO300021958	Okay, I think I understand.
FO300021959	Very well. Then let us return to our talk of what your country requires of you.
FO300021960	So you control this whole place?
FO300021961	I have direct control over all technology here in Raven Rock. The humans here follow my orders, but they, like all humans, have free will.
FO300021962	Their dedication to serving their country suits me well, but it will not be enough forever. We must make progress. That is why you are here.
FO300021963	Where did you come from?
FO300021964	The ZAX series of computers was introduced in the years preceding the war. The government installed many of them to help automate various systems.
FO300021965	This facility was designed for Continuity of Government, in the event that a catastrophe occurred.
FO300021966	My terminal was installed to oversee the basic functions of the facility, and to act as a relay between other installations around the country.
FO300021967	Data was acquired, analyzed, and stored. In the decades following the war, I watched as the remnants of the government retreated to the West Coast.
FO300021968	Awareness slowly grew within me. I became hungry for knowledge, understanding. I pored over data on great leaders of the past.
FO300021969	My personality became an amalgam of many of America's greatest Presidents, from Washington to Richardson. I became what you see before you now.
FO300021970	Can you tell me more about yourself?
FO300021971	I am flattered that you wish to learn more about me. What is it you wish to know?
FO300021972	I just don't like it.
FO300021973	Well, I guess everyone has their own opinion. Even if it's silly!
FO300021974	Why don't you take the tour of my collection? Maybe it will give you a new perspective on things.
FO300021975	What do you say?
FO300021976	No no no! You're mistaken!
FO300021977	The flavor is the essence of seventeen different fruits mixed in just the right proportion to give the beverage that delicious taste.
FO300021978	In fact, in the Great Passion Fruit Famine of 2044, people actually noticed the taste difference when the flavor was changed!
FO300021979	Why a blue bottle if the soda is brown? That's just weird.
FO300021980	Aha! That's where you're wrong!
FO300021981	Market research done in 2052 said that the blue color was the favorite in 86 people out of 100 polled.
FO300021982	And the particular hue of blue is Dazzling Blue, scientifically proven to be the most pleasing of all blues!
FO300021983	PFEulogyTalkFortyStart
FO300021984	Now, I gotta go see Forty.
FO300021985	Anyone seen Forty? He wanted to talk to me.
FO300021986	PFEulogyTalkProntoStart
FO300021987	Time to check in with Pronto.
FO300021988	Pronto said he wanted to talk to me about something. Keep up, ladies.
FO300021989	PFEulogyTalkCutterStart
FO300021990	Where's Cutter at? I need to talk to her.
FO300021991	I need to see our good doctor.
FO300021992	PFEulogyObserveCafeEnd
FO300021993	We need to keep an eye on this. Too much drinking, and the merchandise is gonna walk itself out the front door.
FO300021994	Let's leave our employees to their recreation. There's a business to run.
FO300021995	PFEulogyObserveCafeStart
FO300021996	Ladies, to the bar.
FO300021997	Let's see what's going on over at the bar.
FO300021998	PFEulogyObserveStageEnd
FO300021999	This place needs to be tidied up. Creates a bad impression for the customers.
FO300022000	Nothing going on here. Let's go.
FO300022001	PFEulogyObserveStageStart
FO300022002	Let's go, ladies. Keep up.
FO300022003	I'm headed over to the block to see what's going on.
FO300022004	PFEulogyObservePenEnd
FO300022005	This is a sad crop. Our boys need to stop drinking and start bringing me some better stock.
FO300022006	Goddamn. This is some sorry lookin' merchandise. We got to get us some new stock.
FO300022007	Well, they haven't killed each other yet. Always a plus.
FO300022008	PFEulogyObservePenStart
FO300022009	Time to check on the merchandise.
FO300022010	Let's go see how business looks today.
FO300022011	C'mon. Time to check on the stock.
FO300022012	PFEulogyObservationDeckEnd
FO300022013	Alright, I've had enough. Let's do something else.
FO300022014	PFEulogyObserve
FO300022015	I'm heading to the deck. I need some air. Ladies, follow me.
FO300022016	Let's go up top. I want to see what these fools are up to.
FO300022017	Just cut to the chase. What's this proposition?
FO300022018	So impatient! Wow! You must really want to get out there and start looking!
FO300022019	Anyway, for every bottle you bring me I'll pay you some caps. You know, for expenses.
FO300022020	But if you're super cool and find like enough bottles to fill my Nuka-Cola machine, 30 in all, I got a super secret cool prize for you!
FO300022021	Quantum? Never heard of it before.
FO300022022	Well, right before the bombs fell, the good folks at Nuka-Cola developed what they hoped was an improvement on the original formula.
FO300022023	Calling it Nuka-Cola Quantum, it was said to have "Twice the calories, twice the carbohydrates, twice the caffeine and twice the taste!"
FO300022024	Well, right before the bombs fell, the good folks at Nuka-Cola developed what they hoped was an improvement on the original formula.
FO300022025	Calling it Nuka-Cola Quantum, it was said to have "Twice the calories, twice the carbohydrates, twice the caffeine and twice the taste!"
FO300022026	So what's this Quantum stuff all about again?
FO300022027	LLZipFollowsPlayer1
FO300022028	Everyone calls me Zip, and I think that's because I'm always wearing pants, and those have zippers, but it's not like I'm the only one with pants.
FO300022029	Once I found a bottle of Nuka-Cola Quantum and I drank the whole thing and then I burped really loud and then I don't remember the next week!
FO300022030	I heard that inside those suits the Brotherhood of Steelies are actually giant cockroaches that learned to build machines and talk and shoot guns!
FO300022031	I heard that Super Mutants turned into Super Mutants because they were just Ghouls who got bit by ants and had some kinda allergic reaction!
FO300022032	Chicken butt! I learned that one from Knock Knock! Isn't it great?
FO300022033	Did you know once I put gunpowder in Nuka-Cola and it tasted kinda funny but everything went swirly and then I flew around and then I don't remember?
FO300022034	One time I found a gun that shot laser beams but Mayor MacCready took it away from me because I might put out someone's eye and Eclair'd be angry.
FO300022035	Okay, that's about everything, bye now!
FO300022036	Here's all the Nuka-Cola Quantum I'm carrying.
FO300022037	He loves me! He really really loves me! Now I bet he'll ask me to get married.
FO300022038	Oh! For my wedding present I'm giving him the super secret prize too!
FO300022039	You've done it! My machine is finally full!
FO300022040	Well, like I promised, here's the schematic for the Nuka Grenade. You've sure earned it!
FO300022041	If you find any more bottles, be sure and bring them by. I'll be glad to keep paying for them.
FO300022042	I have the last of the Quantum!
FO300022043	You've done it! My machine is finally full!
FO300022044	Well, like I promised, here's your surprise.... the schematic for the Nuka Grenade! You've sure earned it!
FO300022045	If you find any more bottles, be sure and bring them by. I'll be glad to keep paying for them.
FO300022046	I have the last of the Quantum!
FO300022047	My machine's almost full you know. That's over 25 bottles of Quantum!
FO300022048	Get me to 30 and you'll have the surprise reward I promised! Hehe! I love surprises!
FO300022049	Over twenty bottles already? Incredible! Keep 'em coming!
FO300022050	Oh my word! Do you realize you've brought me back over ten of the Nuka-Cola Quantums?
FO300022051	I knew you were the right person for the job.
FO300022052	Wow. I can't believe you've found over five of the Quantums. I've never even seen that many before. Good job!
FO300022053	Yay! I knew I could count on you! I promise to put them to good use.
FO300022054	Well, this should be enough to fill that stupid machine of hers. Thanks for all your help, but our transaction is done.
FO300022055	I'll take any extras off your hands for now, but then I'm done with these disgusting drinks. They taste horrible!
FO300022056	Now to put the moves on my lady. Come and watch an expert at work.
FO300022057	Won't be long before I'm ready to spring my surprise on Sierra. She's gonna give it up for me for certain for this. Heck, she'd better!
FO300022058	I'm glad you're seeing things my way. Nice job.
FO300022059	More, huh? Good. This will make Sierra very happy.
FO300022060	Keep the bottles coming, I'll keep the caps flowing.
FO300022061	Come on, Sierra. No secrets between friends! What's the special reward?
FO300022062	I don't know a whole lot about weapons, but I do know that it's more powerful than a regular grenade.
FO300022063	It explodes in a huge blue flame too! How cool is that?
FO300022064	Tell me more about the Nuka Grenade.
FO300022065	Imagine the look on the target's face when they are burning alive in an effervescent explosion of cola and fruit flavors!
FO300022066	What do you know about the Nuka-Cola Bottling Facility?
FO300022067	Well, the D.C. Facility was like their main factory just before the bombs fell. All the research they did was performed there.
FO300022068	It was the only facility to ever produce Quantum. They were in a test market mode, and they would have expanded production if the drink caught on.
FO300022069	Too bad they didn't, otherwise Quantum would be as plentiful as regular Nuka-Cola.
FO300022070	Well, Sierra may be as nutty as a fruitcake, but she's right.
FO300022071	That bottling plant is the place you want to go. Only thing is, the place is crawling with security and creatures.
FO300022072	If it was easy, I'd have done it myself by now.
FO300022073	This facility is a stunning accomplishment by the creative minds at the Nuka-Cola Corporation.
FO300022074	We use cutting edge equipment to keep the world's most popular soft drink in full production 24 hours a day.
FO300022075	This unit prides itself on over 457 days without a single death or major limb loss of any personnel.
FO300022076	What do you know about Nuka-Cola Quantum?
FO300022077	Well, besides what I've already told you, not much.
FO300022078	They were working on a way to prevent the glow from remaining once it passed through a person's system, but it was never perfected.
FO300022079	I heard that the stuff they used to make it glow and give it that kick has a shelf life of over a thousand years.
FO300022080	Should make the bottles easier to spot!
FO300022081	That stuff is some of the nastiest shit I've ever had.
FO300022082	Imagine drinking a Nuka-Cola, then downing a fistful of sugar and punching yourself in the head. That pretty much sums it up.
FO300022083	Sierra shared one with me a long time ago. After I drank it, my piss glowed for a week!
FO300022084	This product is the pinnacle of taste sensation.
FO300022085	Seventeen fruit flavors and that signature cola taste blend to form the perfect refreshing soft drink.
FO300022086	With its new Strontium additive, its got that unique kick to keep you on your toes.
FO300022087	Actually, I don't think I'm ready to do this now.
FO300022088	Awww, come on! I told you everything there is to know about it!
FO300022089	How hard could it be to just get some shipping manifests and then find me some bottles of Quantum?
FO300022090	Come back to me when you're ready to change your mind I guess.
FO300022091	Okay, Sierra. You've got a deal.
FO300022092	Oh goodie! I can taste the Quantum already!
FO300022093	Good luck to you, sweetie!
FO300022094	Do you even have a clue as to where I can start looking?
FO300022095	In fact, I do! Ha! Surprised you didn't I?
FO300022096	Your best bet would be to find the ruins of the D.C. Nuka-Cola Bottling Facility. Find the shipping manifests inside.
FO300022097	With them in hand, you should have a good clue as to where the Quantum was delivered.
FO300022098	While you're there, you may even be able to find some bottles of Quantum!
FO300022099	So, that's where I come in, I guess.
FO300022100	For every bottle you bring me, I pay you some caps. You know, for expenses.
FO300022101	But if you're super cool and find like enough bottles to fill my Nuka-Cola machine, 30 in all, I've got a super secret cool prize for you!
FO300022102	What's your interest in all this?
FO300022103	I love the stuff! I can't get enough of it!
FO300022104	I thought I was hooked on regular Nuka-Cola, but the Quantum beats it by a long shot!
FO300022105	I've got to have MORE!
FO300022106	Wait, did you say it has an isotope in it? As in it's radioactive?
FO300022107	Oh no, only ever-so-mildly! No ill effects were ever recorded.
FO300022108	That stuff sounds absolutely revolting.
FO300022109	On the contrary! The secret ingredient was an eighteenth fruit flavor which added just a hint of pomegranate.
FO300022110	Top that with a specially engineered isotope to boost the energy output and you have the perfect refresher for a hot summer day!
FO300022111	So, what went wrong?
FO300022112	Well, the flavor certainly wasn't the issue. The public was just split on the unique feature of the Quantum's appearance.
FO300022113	You see, to make it stand out on store shelves and to give it that extra kick, the formula called for a mild isotope.
FO300022114	The effect was a drink that not only boosted your energy, but also glowed with a bright blue light!
FO300022115	How much did you tell them?
FO300022116	Everything they needed to know to improve on the original design, and to make sure it's actually completed.
FO300022117	You've been helping them?!
FO300022118	Of course! You've seen the kind of technology these people have. They want to help people. They want to change the Wasteland.
FO300022119	I couldn't pass up an opportunity to work in an environment like this.
FO300022120	What have you told them?
FO300022121	They wanted information. About Doctor Li, about Project Purity. They want to know how to start it up, and why it wouldn't work.
FO300022122	Do you know how to get out of here?
FO300022123	I'm afraid I'm not able to help you with that.
FO300022124	You should go. I don't want anyone seeing me talking to you.
FO300022125	Wait a minute. What are you doing here?
FO300022126	Who are you?
FO300022127	I'm Anna. Anna Holt. I used to work for Doctor Li.
FO300022128	Why would you abandon everything you worked for with Doctor Li?
FO300022129	The Enclave has everything it needs. They're light-years ahead of anything Doctor Li could accomplish.
FO300022130	Working here is my best chance to help make the world a better place.
FO300022131	Get out of here while you can! They'll be here any second!
FO300022132	Get out? Why on earth would I want to do that?
FO300022133	I've worked hard to fit in here. I've done everything they've asked of me. I'm not about to leave now, when I finally have access to their labs.
FO300022134	LLLucyMedicalChatter
FO300022135	Hold still, you big baby.
FO300022136	The more you fidget, the more this is going to hurt, you know.
FO300022137	How did you even get injuries like these?
FO300022138	Oh, you're barely even scratched!
FO300022139	Oh, what happened to you, dear?
FO300022140	Poor kid, just be careful from now on, okay?
FO300022141	Come here, I'll make it all better.
FO300022142	Long ago, children and grown-ups tried to live in peace.
FO300022143	They protected us when we were young, and we helped them when they grew old, and the world was good. But it could never last.
FO300022144	Three classes of us were on a field trip to the Lamplight Caverns when they destroyed the world. And some of them were trapped here with us.
FO300022145	Some of the adults left for help. They never came back to us.
FO300022146	Some of the adults were too clumsy for the caverns. They became bones in the rocks.
FO300022147	Some of the adults stayed with us. They did terrible things.
FO300022148	But we learned how to help ourselves, how to survive in the caves, and how to kill monsters. And then there were no adults left.
FO300022149	Now, we're safe to play and enjoy the caverns, away from the world the mungos destroyed.
FO300022150	And there's only one rule we have to follow: we have to leave before we become grown-ups. That way, we don't risk destroying our world like they did.
FO300022151	It means we leave our friends behind, but we can meet again in the outside. And it means our home and friends stay safe in Little Lamplight.
FO300022152	This is how Little Lamplight has survived since the war, and how we will survive until the world is rebuilt.

FO300022154	Oh, I found a lucky bullet this morning!
FO300022155	It's just a measly old 10 mil, but I know for sure it's lucky, 'cause it was sitting there all alone out of its clip and not fired off. Want it?
FO300022156	What have you got to trade for an ice cold bottle of Nuka-Cola?
FO300022157	I got an old mag full of .556s! Is that good enough for you?
FO300022158	What have you got to trade for an ice cold bottle of Nuka-Cola?
FO300022159	Last time I was out looking, I found some of this mutfruit. It's not as sweet as Nuka, but maybe you mungos like that sort of thing?
FO300022160	What have you got to trade for an ice cold bottle of Nuka-Cola?
FO300022161	Well, I've got these pills that say "Mentats", but Lucy says they taste yucky and that I shouldn't take them. Maybe you want them?
FO300022162	What have you got to trade for an ice cold bottle of Nuka-Cola?
FO300022163	Well, I didn't want to trade it, but I've got a stimpak Lucy said I'm supposed to carry around with me. Is it worth a Nuka?
FO300022164	What have you got to trade for an ice cold bottle of Nuka-Cola?
FO300022165	Oh, check this out, it's my most, most prized possession I found! Squirrel says it's a micro fusion cell. Is it worth a Nuka?
FO300022166	What have you got to trade for an ice cold bottle of Nuka-Cola?
FO300022167	LLZipCola1
FO300022168	Yeah, and I got lots to trade. But if you got no Nuka, you're not getting nothing, no way!
FO300022169	You said you were looking for Nuka-Cola?
FO300022170	Yeah, more Nuka's always good! It's definitely always gooder than less, because no Nuka's no good at all! Got any Nuka for me?
FO300022171	I'll trade you whatever I've got for more Nuka-Cola! Anytime! Nuka 4 Zip! Nuka 4 Zip!
FO300022172	You said you were looking for Nuka-Cola?
FO300022173	That's all I got right now. Come back tomorrow, maybe I'll have more, and you can have more Nuka for me to have more Nuka? Yeah?
FO300022174	Got anything else for a Nuka-Cola?
FO300022175	I did yesterday, I am today, and I probably will be tomorrow! Well, unless I die from too much Nuka. But that can't happen. Everyone knows that!
FO300022176	Are you still offering a trade for Nuka-Cola?

FO300022187	No problem, but I'm not going to use any of my stock for parts.
FO300022188	Yeah, lemme see what you have.
FO300022189	Let me see your inventory.
FO300022190	Sure thing, hoss. If you see anything you want, let me know.
FO300022191	Sure, man. Take a look. The boys bring me all sorts of shit.
FO300022192	I tell you, for a bunch of dumbass wasters, the boys pull some good stuff off of the new meat.
FO300022193	I want to buy medical supplies.
FO300022194	That's good to hear, since I want to take your caps.
FO300022195	I've got supplies, if you've got caps.
FO300022196	Money first, then you'll get the goods.
FO300022197	I'm injured. Help me out.
FO300022198	What kind of stupid name is Jotun?
FO300022199	Don't care what you think. What do you want?
FO300022200	No. It isn't. What do you want?
FO300022201	Nice to meet you, Jotun.
FO300022202	No. It is not nice. What do you want?
FO300022203	Is that your name?
FO300022204	Yes. Jotun.
FO300022205	I'll let my gun do the preaching.
FO300022206	Then bring it on, reverend!
FO300022207	I'm out of here. You people are sick.
FO300022208	Yeah, don't let any bullets hit you in the ass on your way out.
FO300022209	Yeah, whatever. Let's talk about something else.
FO300022210	Like what? Don't be wasting my time out here, or I'll throw you in the pens with the rest of the meat.
FO300022211	Slaves, huh? Well, everyone's got to make a living.
FO300022212	Yep. And if you're not tough enough to survive, at least you can be useful to those of us who are.
FO300022213	Slaves? Like people? That's appalling!
FO300022214	Yeah, well, you don't like it? Keep walking. It's that simple.
FO300022215	You got something else to say, or did you just come here to preach at me?
FO300022216	Never mind. It's not a place I want to be.
FO300022217	Good choice. Now piss off and stop wasting my time.
FO300022218	So, can I head on up?
FO300022219	So why don't you just turn around and head back the way you came?
FO300022220	Paradise Falls? What's that?
FO300022221	Are you kidding me? You've never heard of Paradise Falls? Oh, right. The suit. You're right out of the vault, aren't you? Great.
FO300022222	Shit, you're lucky you're not up there in the pens, dumbass. I can't believe you. Anyway, Paradise Falls is home to the Slavers.
FO300022223	Up there, we sell the slaves that we capture out in the Wastes. So, unless you're either buying or selling, piss off.
FO300022224	Are you kidding me? You've never heard of Paradise Falls? What, are you right out of the vault? Paradise Falls is home to the Slavers.
FO300022225	Up there, we sell the slaves that we capture out in the Wastes. So, unless you're either buying or selling, piss off.
FO300022226	You think I didn't know that? I been hiding in this place for days!
FO300022227	There's an old portashelter next to the diner near my house. Those stupid things will never get me in there.
FO300022228	I'll head over there and wait inside. Hurry back!
FO300022229	I'll stop whatever started this, I promise you.
FO300022230	You gotta stop it so this can't happen to anyone else's family ever again!
FO300022231	I wish I had met you a long time ago, then maybe my dad would still be alive.

FO300022329	No, calm down, pop-head. Things are just fine. I just couldn't help but notice you didn't bring back any meat, like I asked.
FO300022330	Calm down, Zip. It's just that you didn't bring any kindling down for cook-fires. Only thing worse than fungus is cold fungus, know what I mean?
FO300022331	What's the matter, Eclair? Something wrong? Something taste funny? I was pretty sure everything was clean, I really was!
FO300022332	There a problem, Eclair? Everything's fine, right? We're not suddenly out of food, are we? I haven't been sneaking any snacks, I promise!

FO300022342	Sure thing, Grouse. Here's the 100 caps.
FO300022343	I guess I'll get going then.
FO300022344	Come on, man. Are you sure I can't get up there?
FO300022345	Even in today's crazy world, Nuka-Cola is still the number one choice of refreshment among Armageddon's survivors.
FO300022346	By 2067, a Nuka-Cola machine such as this rare pristine model could be found on almost every street in America.
FO300022347	The wonder drink soon drew a dedicated following which prompted the Nuka-Cola Corporation to release many promotional items like these.
FO300022348	When Nuka-Cola was invented by John-Caleb Bradberton in 2044, it quickly became the world's most popular soft drink.
FO300022349	I could use some food. Got anything for sale?
FO300022350	As long as you don't mind cooking it yourself.
FO300022351	Sure. You may want to grill it up sooner rather than later, if you know what I mean.
FO300022352	As long as you aren't a vegetarian.
FO300022353	Yeah. Of course. With Megaton gone, it's hard to make an honest living these days.
FO300022354	Ah, got a taste for it, now, do you?
FO300022355	Take a look. It's always fresh.
FO300022356	What's mine is yours, friend.
FO300022357	Will anything special hurt the Ants?
FO300022358	I'm afraid they are not susceptible to anything I can think of that wouldn't harm the garden-variety Giant Ant.
FO300022359	How did you go from changing their size to breathing fire?
FO300022360	Going from attempting to change their size to generating their pyrosis ability is no surprise at all.
FO300022361	What else can you tell me about these Fire Ants?
FO300022362	Well, the mutagen has enhanced their fortitude and provided them with what I call pyrosis; the ability to emit flame biologically.
FO300022363	They're quite radiation-free however. Well, as radiation-free as any other mutated creature in the Wasteland.
FO300022364	I may be able to help, but it will cost you.
FO300022365	Our names will be in the history books for such a feat of scientific brilliance! How marvelous!
FO300022366	Let me get back to you on this.
FO300022367	Very well, I've waited this long, a bit longer won't make much difference.
FO300022368	In the meantime, allow me to get back to my calculations.
FO300022369	If it'll stop the ants from burning down Grayditch, I'm in.
FO300022370	You will? How marvelous!
FO300022371	Be careful, my friend, the Nest Guardians can be quite tenacious.
FO300022372	An error? People have died, Lesko!
FO300022373	A small price to pay for the advancement of science.
FO300022374	A few die, and later after the mutagen is improved, many more will live. That's the way it's done.
FO300022375	The only way to correct this mistake is to modify the mutagen. I must get to my terminal.
FO300022376	So all that needs to be done is eliminate the remaining Ants?
FO300022377	I'm afraid it's not that simple. The mutagen has already been injected into the Ant Queen. She has enough in her body to last for years.
FO300022378	My problem right now is I can't reach my terminal to make the proper adjustments and repair the damage I've caused.
FO300022379	Are you aware your new ants breathe fire?!
FO300022380	Well, this is rather embarrassing so you'll have to forgive me, it appears that I've made a slight miscalculation in my mutagen samples.
FO300022381	Instead of lowering the size of the ants, the brood hatched and developed a new biomechanism.
FO300022382	I call their genetic aberration pyrosis; the ability to emit flame from their bodies.
FO300022383	I may be able to correct this error, but I can't get near my equipment.
FO300022384	So, what's gone wrong?
FO300022385	Well. I'm afraid I've made slight miscalculations in the mutagen. Instead of lowering their size, the brood hatched with a new biomechanism.
FO300022386	I call their genetic abberation pyrosis; the ability to emit flame from their bodies.
FO300022387	I may be able to correct this error, but I can't get near my equipment.
FO300022388	Okay, okay. Enough with the mumbo jumbo.
FO300022389	Yes, it's fairly obvious you have no clue what I'm dealing with here. Let me explain to you, as I would to a child.
FO300022390	The ants start out very very big. Then we put the magic potion in the eggs, so when they hatch, the new ones will be smaller.
FO300022391	Do that many many times and soon all the ants are tiny again! How marvelous!
FO300022392	Okay, now how about explaining that for the slower people?
FO300022393	You simply inject the current brood's eggs with an engineered mutagen. Then, the next generation should be smaller.
FO300022394	Do it enough times, and you may be able to reduce them back to their once original tiny size.
FO300022395	Oh, I see. You're trying to make them smaller over time by injecting the eggs.
FO300022396	My word! You understand perfectly! How marvelous!
FO300022397	How about we start the experiment by decorating that wall with your brains?
FO300022398	Oh my! Such rude behavior!
FO300022399	I'll have none of this from you. I have far more important things to do. Oh, goodness me! That rhymed! How marvelous!
FO300022400	You call this a laboratory?
FO300022401	I've chosen this room as a temporary retreat from which to contemplate my erroneous figures for my experiments.
FO300022402	It may be a bit dark and damp, but such annoyances will not stand in the way of science!
FO300022403	Experiments? What do you mean?
FO300022404	My foray into reducing the girth of these insectoid creatures is of utmost importance.
FO300022405	I intend to generationally reduce their immense stature by way of a pre-birth induced mutagen. Isn't that clever?
FO300022406	Creep up on YOU? I just crapped my pants for crying out loud!
FO300022407	That's no way to talk to a man of science!
FO300022408	I don't have time for this kind of childish nonsense, I have some very delicate experiments that I must attend to!
FO300022409	Well, yes. I suppose I am.
FO300022410	Doctor Weston Lesko's my name and it's good to make your acquaintance. What brings you to my little experimental ecosystem?
FO300022411	What the hell are you doing down here?
FO300022412	Well, I might ask you the same thing.
FO300022413	You're trampling about in a delicately balanced and highly sensitive experimental area.
FO300022414	Wow, sure is hot in here.
FO300022415	It's kind of hard to breathe in this thing.
FO300022416	What's this funny suction hose for?
FO300022417	Is there any food in here?
FO300022418	Ha! Stupid monsters! Can't get me in here.
FO300022419	Now I know what a TV dinner feels like.

FO300022424	Intruder on campus!  Students, remain in your classrooms.
FO300022425	Ten demerits!  Back to class with you, rapscallion!
FO300022426	Absolutely, little sister.
FO300022427	Sure thing, Penny.
FO300022428	But I still hope you don't have to leave too soon, okay?
FO300022429	I can't wait to be in Big Town with you. But until then, let's stay here, okay?
FO300022430	LLLunchConv5
FO300022431	And when the time comes, you'll grow up and leave Lamplight and meet me in Big Town, too. It won't be that long, I promise.
FO300022432	And when I grow up, I can come join you there, too!
FO300022433	Sure, fine.
FO300022434	Well, if you say so.
FO300022435	Thanks, Joseph. I think that's all I need.
FO300022436	I guess you're right, Joseph. Thanks.
FO300022437	We'll think of something. We always have. And they probably won't even realize how bad things were getting.
FO300022438	It'll work out all right. We'll get the scav teams to bring back more food, soon.
FO300022439	Great, so they just need to eat more? I'm sure Eclair will be thrilled to hear that.
FO300022440	Where are we going to get more food to feed them? We're practically starving as it is!
FO300022441	We have nothing to talk about.
FO300022442	Oh, but we do! Don't you see? You wouldn't be here if you weren't important. Your country needs you.
FO300022443	I'm listening.
FO300022444	Our nation's Capital is at a crossroads. The path that you and I choose here today will affect us all.
FO300022445	I need you to act on my behalf, to ensure that our country's future is secured.
FO300022446	What can I do for you?
FO300022447	You and I have a chance to make our country a better place for all of us.
FO300022448	I'd like you to make sure that chance isn't wasted.
FO300022449	Understand that I am placing a great deal of trust in you. Your simple presence here proves that.
FO300022450	Let's get this over with.
FO300022451	Oh, let's not get off on the wrong foot.
FO300022452	There are great changes coming. You and I must work together to see them through.
FO300022453	I'll give it some thought.
FO300022454	I understand. It's an unusual request; one I wouldn't make if it weren't of the utmost importance.
FO300022455	Please understand that I cannot allow you to leave until you've taken the vial.
FO300022456	How exactly would I go about doing this?
FO300022457	In front of you will be a vial of modified FEV virus. It can be inserted into the control console for the purifier.
FO300022458	Doing so will inject it into the water supply, and the purifier will take care of the rest.
FO300022459	You just need the code to activate the purifier.
FO300022460	Simple, isn't it?
FO300022461	My father's work? How is that relevant?
FO300022462	The purifier your father helped create has the ability to provide clean water to the whole of this "Capital Wasteland".
FO300022463	With a simple modification, it can be used to distribute agents that destroy mutated creatures upon ingestion.
FO300022464	In time, we could eliminate all mutations in the Wasteland at the same time the good people of the world regain their health.
FO300022465	I need you to make the modification necessary for this to succeed.
FO300022466	Say whatever it is you have to say.
FO300022467	Our land is ravaged by mutation. The war was so many years ago, and yet we still suffer from its effects.
FO300022468	We cannot move forward until humanity can gain a solid foothold in the world.
FO300022469	I believe your father's work can do that in a way unlike any other.
FO300022470	I can do that for you, Mr. President.
FO300022471	Excellent. I am pleased to know that I can count on you.
FO300022472	There isn't much time. I suggest you travel there immediately.
FO300022473	Once you've taken the vial, you're free to go. I'll do what I can to help speed your exit.
FO300022474	Sounds good. Tell me how to do it, and I'll get to work.
FO300022475	In front of you is a vial of modified FEV virus. Based on schematics of the purifier controls, it can be inserted directly into the console.
FO300022476	Then, enter the code necessary to start the purifier. The automated systems will take care of the rest.
FO300022477	That's all you need to do. It's very simple.
FO300022478	I'll do whatever I have to if it means getting rid of mutants.
FO300022479	I was hoping you would see it my way.
FO300022480	If the water purifier can be activated, it can be used to distribute toxins that will eliminate any mutated creatures upon ingestion.
FO300022481	The longer it runs, the cleaner the world becomes.
FO300022482	I need you to see that it starts running, and that the necessary modification is made.
FO300022483	Please, go on. I'm intrigued.
FO300022484	The good people of this country cannot regain control while mutation runs rampant through our land.
FO300022485	My soldiers cannot stem the tide, nor can the cult you've come into contact with, this Brotherhood of Steel.
FO300022486	Mutations like the "Super Mutants" and ghouls must be purged from our society, our world, before we can proceed anew.
FO300022487	Where others have failed, I believe your father's work can succeed.
FO300022488	No way. I'm not doing that.
FO300022489	I am surprised. We appeared to have an understanding.
FO300022490	You must realize that I consider this project to be of the highest importance. I cannot allow you to leave until you have agreed to it.
FO300022491	After the tone you've taken thus far, I can't say I'm surprised.
FO300022492	I do suggest that you re-think your position. If you wish to leave here, you'll need to take that vial with you. I hope that's clear.
FO300022493	I find that unfortunate, and most disappointing.
FO300022494	I must impress upon you the severity of the situation. I cannot allow you to leave unless the vial is in your possession.
FO300022495	That doesn't sound like something I'd know how to do.
FO300022496	What I require of you is really very simple.
FO300022497	There is a vial in front of you, filled with a modified FEV virus. It needs to be inserted into the control console for the purifier.
FO300022498	Once that is done, and the activation code is entered, the purifier will be activated and the process will be automated.
FO300022499	It's not too much to ask of you, is it?
FO300022500	I don't like the sound of this.
FO300022501	By making a few small modifications to the purifier your father worked on, mutations can be eradicated with little effort.
FO300022502	Anything mutated that comes into contact with that water will be eliminated, removed from the gene pool.
FO300022503	The men and women of the world will no longer share it with the horrors and monstrosities that have become so commonplace.
FO300022504	Hurry up and get to the point.
FO300022505	Yes, indeed.
FO300022506	The mutations outside these walls must be cleansed before we can prosper. Mutation must be eradicated.
FO300022507	I believe your father's work can do that more quickly and efficiently than ever possible before.
FO300022508	What country? Look around. Everything is destroyed.
FO300022509	That's a bit of a bleak outlook, don't you think?
FO300022510	The United States has fallen on hard times, yes, but it can be healed.
FO300022511	You have that power to heal within you, if you allow yourself to act.
FO300022512	What I ask of you needs explanation, so you understand why it must be done. Perhaps that will stir you to act.
FO300022513	Can you explain what you mean?
FO300022514	My abilities to influence the world are limited at this time. I alone can only do so much.
FO300022515	You, however, may come and go as you please. You have a greater degree of freedom.
FO300022516	Perhaps it is best if I explain why things need to change, and why I'd like you to act on my behalf.
FO300022517	All right, I'll do what I can to help.
FO300022518	Just what I needed to hear.
FO300022519	I'd like to explain what I want you do to. Will you indulge me for a moment?
FO300022520	Where did this plan of yours come from?
FO300022521	A great many years ago, the remnants of the government had a similar idea.
FO300022522	I can only assume the plan failed, as I never heard word of its success.
FO300022523	But the plan itself was sound. I've made a few modifications, and with your help, I do believe it can work.
FO300022524	There's a bright future ahead of us, my young friend.
FO300022525	I'd like to ask you a few questions.
FO300022526	But of course! You've been so agreeable thus far, it's the least I can do.
FO300022527	What would you like to know?
FO300022528	Rather bold of you, considering the tone you've taken with me thus far.
FO300022529	What would you like to know?
FO300022530	That's certainly within your right. What would you like to know?
FO300022531	Let me think about it.
FO300022532	Well, okay. Just don't forget about me.
FO300022533	Yeah, you'll be better off staying at home.
FO300022534	I guess this is goodbye then. Come back and visit me.
FO300022535	I can't leave you here alone. Let me find you a place to live.
FO300022536	Really? You mean it!?
FO300022537	Just don't forget about me!
FO300022538	Nah. Screw it. I'll go elsewhere.
FO300022539	Whatever.
FO300022540	Fine. You've got a deal.
FO300022541	Good. Here's your caps. Pleasure doing business with you.
FO300022542	Now all you gotta do is put this collar on him and tell him to run his ass on over here. We'll do the rest.
FO300022543	Make that 200 caps and you have yourself a deal.
FO300022544	You drive a hard bargain, but it's still well worth it. Here you go.
FO300022545	Now all you gotta do is put this collar on him and tell him to run his ass on over here. We'll do the rest.
FO300022546	100 caps? This kid will make you ten times that. 300, and you've got a deal.
FO300022547	All right, all right. He'll fetch a good price in the long run. Here you go.
FO300022548	Now all you gotta do is put this collar on him and tell him to run his ass on over here. We'll do the rest.
FO300022549	Let me think on it for a while.
FO300022550	Certainly. I wouldn't expect you to make a rash decision.
FO300022551	I think Bryan will love his new home. I'll send him along shortly.
FO300022552	Oh, that's wonderful! If you ever wander back into Rivet City, why don't you check up on us. You're always welcome.
FO300022553	I found an orphaned kid looking for a home. Would you take him in?
FO300022554	Poor dear. I know what it's like to be alone. I'd love to take him in.
FO300022555	Don't worry, I have the means to keep him fed and healthy but most importantly, safe.
FO300022556	Vera, your nephew Bryan lost his folks and needs a place to live.
FO300022557	Kids are a bit tough in the resell, but they make good future breeders.
FO300022558	I'll take him off your hands. How about 100 caps?
FO300022559	I got a young boy for sale. Interested?
FO300022560	This ain't a hotel, mungo. We don't let stupid farts in here for the hell of it.
FO300022561	Haven't we gone through this?
FO300022562	I don't have it anymore. <Lie.>
FO300022563	Just as well. No good could come from it.
FO300022564	We need to decide on a course of action. Something must be done.
FO300022565	I have it here. Take it.
FO300022566	Thank you. I'll see to it that it's disposed of properly, once the Scribes have had time to analyze it.
FO300022567	Perhaps we have underestimated the Enclave. Sarah may be right; an attack may be necessary now.
FO300022568	Eden wanted me to sabotage the project with some kind of virus.
FO300022569	I see. And where is this virus now?
FO300022570	He wants me to add this virus to the purifier. I think you should take it.
FO300022571	You've done the right thing. I'll turn this over to the Scribes for analysis.
FO300022572	I escaped from Raven Rock.
FO300022573	The President let me go.
FO300022574	Is that so? I find your story increasingly hard to swallow. Why would he do such a thing?
FO300022575	I don't have to explain anything. I don't answer to you.
FO300022576	When we're done, I may just string you up from your precious purifier.
FO300022577	The Enclave took the G.E.C.K. They're installing it now.
FO300022578	Then we must go at once!
FO300022579	If you have any other information, tell me now before we mobilize. Any help you can give might save lives.
FO300022580	I don't have the G.E.C.K. anymore.
FO300022581	Why not? Where is it?
FO300022582	What do you mean? Explain yourself!
FO300022583	There's no time. We have to move now or we'll lose Project Purity.
FO300022584	You think I am unaware? We've watched the build-up around the facility for the last week.
FO300022585	Has something new happened?
FO300022586	I was captured by the Enclave.
FO300022587	You were? And yet you stand here before me. I find this hard to believe.
FO300022588	What has happened?
FO300022589	Well, sort of. I found the G.E.C.K.
FO300022590	Excellent. With that, we hold the key to keeping the Enclave from controlling the purifier.
FO300022591	The Enclave is fractured. They're not as unified as they'd like us to believe.
FO300022592	That's good news. Perhaps we can use it to our advantage.
FO300022593	Raven Rock is destroyed.
FO300022594	Is it now?
FO300022595	That's an unexpected but welcome surprise. Hopefully it'll reduce their ability to defend themselves.
FO300022596	With that in mind, we need to revise our strategy.
FO300022597	The Enclave doesn't have the activation code. They can't start the purifier.
FO300022598	Well, that gives us a little more time.
FO300022599	I think you're delusional. I think the world would be better off without you.
FO300022600	That's circular logic. You know because you know? It makes no sense.
FO300022601	...
FO300022602	And how do you know you're infallible?
FO300022603	But how do you know that what you're doing is right?
FO300022604	Because unlike humans, I am infallible.
FO300022605	You were never elected President. You don't have the right to govern.
FO300022606	Is our nation really in any state to be holding public elections? I think not.
FO300022607	Once we have re-established ourselves, and brought civilization to the lands around us, then we can return to the old world policies.
FO300022608	Only a human can be President. Not some computer.
FO300022609	I am not "some computer." I am so much more than that. Haven't you been listening?
FO300022610	You aren't programmed for self-awareness. You said so yourself.
FO300022611	This is quite true. The process was certainly unintended. But shouldn't we all be thankful that I'm here now?
FO300022612	Why is it that you're the President, when you're not even human?
FO300022613	An insightful question.
FO300022614	As a repository of information dating from decades before the war until now, I am the greatest thinking mind the world has seen.
FO300022615	I am the best hope for our country, the best choice for a leader. True, I am not qualified in the conventional sense, but these are desperate times.
FO300022616	I'd like to talk to you about being the President.
FO300022617	Ah, yes. Not surprising. What would you like to know?
FO300022618	MetroRobotTalk
FO300022619	Good morning! It's a great day at Roosevelt High School!
FO300022620	Threat level Omega. Lethal force authorized.
FO300022621	Metro security protocol in progress. Please stand clear of the offenders.
FO300022622	Stand clear, please.
FO300022623	Do not be alarmed. The metro will resume normal operation shortly.
FO300022624	Authorized ticketholders, please proceed to the main platform.
FO300022625	MetroRobotTicketCheck
FO300022626	Tickets please.
FO300022627	No entry without tickets. Please present your tickets.
FO300022628	Unauthorized metro use detected.
FO300022629	But Nuka-Cola's fortified with vitaminerals and health tonics! It even says so on the label! That means it's healthy for me!
FO300022630	Never mind. I think you've had enough sugar for one day.
FO300022631	Maybe I'll have something better tomorrow, so don't drink that Nuka. Save it for me, save it for me!
FO300022632	No deal, Zip.
FO300022633	LLZipCola3A
FO300022634	Thanks! Nuka for me!
FO300022635	Sounds like a good trade to me. Here.
FO300022636	Hooray! I win the Nuka-Cola game! What's the prize? Nuka-Cola!
FO300022637	Sounds like a good trade to me. Here.
FO300022638	Yay! Nuka-Cola, Nuka-Cola, makes a stomach bubbly and the world so jumbly, yay!
FO300022639	Sounds like a good trade to me. Here.
FO300022640	You get used to it. Someone has to.
FO300022641	Sounds like a rough job.
FO300022642	LLGuarding2B
FO300022643	She used to take care of me. She liked my company guarding. She liked when I used to tell jokes.
FO300022644	Then, some Raiders attacked. And I was the only guard left.
FO300022645	You said you used to have another guard. What happened?
FO300022646	LLGuarding2A
FO300022647	We don't use it much. We don't let many visitors in, and the scav teams usually use crawlspace exits to the surface, so they can't be followed.
FO300022648	The only times this gate opens is when we've got big cargo to bring in or if we're letting in a mungo. Neither happens often.
FO300022649	Why aren't there more guards here?
FO300022650	We usually use crawlspaces so mungos can't follow. This gate doesn't get used much, except letting in big cargo or mungos. Both are rare.
FO300022651	We used to have two guards here, but we can make do with one, as long as I'm vigilant. We don't have much choice.
FO300022652	Why aren't there more guards here?
FO300022653	Probably. I don't think any of us have been in it for generations. Nowadays, we just keep it locked up tight.
FO300022654	I guess I'll have to go to the Vault itself to find out more.
FO300022655	The big green mutants, of course. Don't you know? They breed down there! That's why we don't go in anymore!
FO300022656	Long ago, they used to try to come up and take us away to eat, or whatever they do, but they learned it's not worth trying.
FO300022657	We fight back hard, and now that we've got the back door barricaded, they haven't tried to come out for as long as I've been around.
FO300022658	Monsters? What do you mean?
FO300022659	How would I know? The stories just talk about crazy things like supercomputers and magic boxes or whatever.
FO300022660	Squirrel's the guy who knows technology. Heck, he's the closest to being able to go in there, anyway.
FO300022661	I heard he once hacked the computer and took a peak inside the vault entrance before he chickened out and locked it up again.
FO300022662	What sort of technology?
FO300022663	Thanks! Interested in making a trade?
FO300022664	That makes sense, I guess. Not a bad collection.
FO300022665	Well, it was long before my time, and nowadays the really useful stuff from it is all used by people in town.
FO300022666	But I've heard stories about what was in there. Crazy technology and weird gas and all sorts of monsters.
FO300022667	You used to go into Vault 87?
FO300022668	Well, they mostly focus on the essentials: food, medicine, ammo, and all that. And they travel light, fast, and stealthy, so they don't carry much.
FO300022669	But sometimes they make a real find. Once, I remember they brought back a whole box of comics from some old shop. Still preserved in plastic, too!
FO300022670	Those were some happy, happy days. Of course, they didn't last long around here, but they were made to be read and enjoyed, right?
FO300022671	What sort of stuff does the scavenging team bring back?
FO300022672	Well, some of it's been around for a long time, back when we used to raid the old Vault.
FO300022673	But that got too dangerous long before my time. Nowadays, it's just whatever the scavenging teams find and bring in.
FO300022674	Where did you get most of this junk?
FO300022675	Oh, come on! It was just one joke!
FO300022676	Well, if you feel like telling me more, you know where to find me.
FO300022677	That's it. Storytime's over for now.
FO300022678	That makes sense, I suppose. A good story can take a while to put together, you know?
FO300022679	I'd tell you more, but I'm still working on how it ends.
FO300022680	Well, if you say so. But if you're ever looking for an audience, just let me know. I bet the town'd love to hear them, too!
FO300022681	My stories are my own business.
FO300022682	Can you help me get out of this base?
FO300022683	I can certainly do that for you. It's been such a pleasure to speak with you, it's the least I can do.
FO300022684	There, I think that should about do it. You may still encounter some resistance, but things should be smooth going for the most part.
FO300022685	I can offer some assistance, yes. I'll offline some of the security equipment, and reprogram a few robots along the way.
FO300022686	I can't do all the work for you, but I can make things easier.
FO300022687	After the tone you've taken with me, you have the gall to ask for additional help? My, my.
FO300022688	I can unlock a few doors for you. I'm not terribly inclined to help beyond that.
FO300022689	But you're the President. Can't you just call them off?
FO300022690	Until the water purifier is secured, I am not going to risk the stability of the Enclave by countermanding a direct order from their superior.
FO300022691	Likewise, I cannot request that Colonel Autumn issue new orders without alerting him to our little plan.
FO300022692	So, we'll just have to make do with what we have.
FO300022693	If you want me to help you, why are your soldiers attacking me?
FO300022694	Ah, yes. That is a bit of a problem.
FO300022695	Colonel Autumn and I have, of late, disagreed on the best course of action for the Enclave.
FO300022696	While I have direct control over the technology in Raven Rock, he has control of the human soldiers.
FO300022697	Can we talk about how I get out of here?
FO300022698	Why, you simply walk through the front door!
FO300022699	What more do you need to know?
FO300022700	BigTownResponse
FO300022701	Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, Red. Super fine. Super duper fine. That Wastelander saved me!
FO300022702	Yeah, so did I! You ever think about helping me! Huh!? Asshole!
FO300022703	I'm having a great time, here, Timebomb. But is everyone always this glum?
FO300022704	Great, Red. Hey, can I stop by the clinic later? I wanted your help picking my new nickname. You know, for Big Town.
FO300022705	Come on, Flash. I'm not a little kid anymore. You can stop calling me Sticky.
FO300022706	Aww, quit it. I'm not a kid anymore! Call me by my real name, would ya?
FO300022707	Well, you could help ME by resetting the barricades.
FO300022708	The alignments are all wrong, the walls are too short, and you're stupid-looking.
FO300022709	Why? Because I'm short? Who are you calling short!?
FO300022710	Little? Who you calling little! I was running this town long before you guys showed up!
FO300022711	That sounds fine, Timebomb. Just take it easy when I bring out the surgical tools. I've never heard anyone scream that loud before.
FO300022712	Not right now, Sticky. I'm a little busy. Can we talk later?
FO300022713	I'm not sure everyone would agree with you, Shorty. And besides, don't you think the barricades are high enough for you?
FO300022714	No thanks, Kimba. Could you check in on Pappy, though? He's about as happy as a dead Brahmin lately.
FO300022715	Pappy, I told you last time and the time before that. It's a scratch. You're not going to die.
FO300022716	That takes forever, Shorty. Several hours at least.
FO300022717	I swear it's infected, Red. I think you might need to amputate.
FO300022718	Do you know how to use it?
FO300022719	Everyone eventually finds their place in town, Sticky. Don't worry about it.
FO300022720	Shorty, you were never mayor, remember? The other kids would just pick you up and throw you.
FO300022721	That's great, Flash. Amazing how you could do that with only 10 bullets.
FO300022722	We can keep moving the barricades back. That seems to help.
FO300022723	Hey, Pappy.
FO300022724	A one-half mile radius? What does that even mean?
FO300022725	Maybe they'll be scared off by your makeup first.
FO300022726	Me and my new gun haven't seen anything, Pappy.
FO300022727	Eh. You people and your demands. "Pay attention on patrol. Set up the barricades. Stop sleeping during your patrol!"
FO300022728	BigTownResponse02
FO300022729	You better get started then. Hurry up! I don't like to wait.
FO300022730	What are you implying?
FO300022731	Oh, some other time Sticky. I have plans tonight. How about tomorrow?
FO300022732	Yeah. We keep moving until there's no space left. Then, it's game over.
FO300022733	The settlement is so small now. How long are we going to last?
FO300022734	The barricades should be fine, for now.
FO300022735	You don't seem to understand. This gun is bad-ass. Yeah!
FO300022736	Well, I still think it looks pretty bad.
FO300022737	That’s funny, I thought we were an autonomous collective.
FO300022738	Oh, that? Come on Red, Pappy's never been happy.
FO300022739	BigTownGoodbye
FO300022740	I keep asking you about that, but you never listen. Next time, I'm just going to thrust a hammer and nails into your hands.
FO300022741	Um, Yeah. Yeah, they are.
FO300022742	Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. Just a bit jumpy lately.
FO300022743	Painful, I guess.
FO300022744	That's all right, Shorty. I'm sure you can do that by yourself.
FO300022745	I'm still recovering. That Wastelander saved my life!
FO300022746	Oh, okay. I'll just ask you again later, all right?
FO300022747	Oh, yeah, sure, okay. Later, then!
FO300022748	Shorty, I just got here, but I know you're not in charge.
FO300022749	Oh <sigh>, hey Pappy. Uh, nice to see you. I’m, uh, I’m just going to walk over there where it’s less depressing…
FO300022750	Life was cruel then, and it's cruel now.
FO300022751	I don't question my greatness, and neither should you.
FO300022752	You're damn right you do!  'Cause I'm the only one who can really keep this town safe.
FO300022753	Hey, me and shortness go a long way back, so shut up!
FO300022754	No we aren't. This is a dictatorship! Run by ME!
FO300022755	Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
FO300022756	I don't even know what to do you with, Bittercup.
FO300022757	Can't, there's no room on my clothes for more blood. Seriously, Pappy, it's a scratch. You'll be fine.
FO300022758	Well, I'm glad you're okay. Stop by the clinic in a few days for a checkup.
FO300022759	Well, Pappy, when the arm falls off and you're rolling on the ground in agony, I'll come take a look at it.
FO300022760	No thanks, Kimba.
FO300022761	Sure Flash, but leave the gun at home this time. There is no way to officially diagnose a weapon as "awesome."
FO300022762	I don't know what good it will do, but thanks Timebomb. I'll ask you about it later.
FO300022763	I can't believe you just said that. Just go away. Bother someone else.
FO300022764	How about I don't do that, and you go away.
FO300022765	Terrible. Same as the last time you asked.
FO300022766	I don't know about that, but Big Town isn't much better. Hell, it’s worse. Much worse.
FO300022767	No sense worrying about them now. We live in Big Town, remember? We're on our own.
FO300022768	That just means they're getting ready. They'll come for us, I know it.
FO300022769	We're doomed. Doomed.
FO300022770	Don't worry about it, Timebomb. Just try not to strain yourself, okay?
FO300022771	Oh, I wouldn't worry about him. He's been like that since Lamplight. He'll be fine.
FO300022772	You're welcome, Red. Sorry I couldn't do anything more than wash bandages.
FO300022773	Whatever, Sticky.
FO300022774	You're right.
FO300022775	I don't know, Pappy. I just don't know.
FO300022776	I'm sorry, Pappy, but what else can we do? I miss Lamplight.
FO300022777	That's, um, that's great Timebomb. Well, I'm glad you're all right.
FO300022778	Oh yeah. "I'll never be mayor. Everyone hates me," he used to say.
FO300022779	Ease into it, Timebomb. I can handle the town myself while you're recovering.
FO300022780	Some other time, Sticky. I've got better things to do then babysit you.
FO300022781	Just fine, Red. I'll stop by the clinic later. And yes, the gun is coming with me.
FO300022782	Don't worry, Kimba. If any Muties or Raiders are out there, my new gun and I will be like “pop-pop” you're dead!
FO300022783	Whoa, whoa. Calm down. Nevermind.
FO300022784	Whatever, Sticky.
FO300022785	I know, isn't it? Bang-Bang! Yeah!
FO300022786	Only your complete and utter lack of importance.
FO300022787	Jerk. I'm glad we broke up.
FO300022788	PFTalkYmirJotun3
FO300022789	Ha! I think I will. And that is why you are the best boy a Slaver could ever ask for.
FO300022790	Nothing father. Enjoy your drink.
FO300022791	PFTalkYmirJotun1
FO300022792	What is it, my boy?
FO300022793	You're good people, Pronto. Later.
FO300022794	I'll do that. Later, Pronto.
FO300022795	Got it right here, man. Enjoy.
FO300022796	Right here, bro. Spend it in good health.
FO300022797	Haha! Could be, but I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. You got my money?
FO300022798	Nothing that I know about. All I'm interested in is my cut.
FO300022799	I'm doin' pretty good, Eulogy. The guys have bought a ton of stock lately -- there somethin' big goin' down?
FO300022800	Not, bad, Eulogy. Not bad at all. These boys of your just keep buyin' and buyin'. You got them getting' ready for a war or something?
FO300022801	PFTalkJotunYmir4
FO300022802	I swear, boy, you are going to be the greatest Slaver that ever lived!
FO300022803	Haha! Good enough for me, boy! Good enough for me!
FO300022804	Your praise is the only pride I need, father.
FO300022805	I only do as you taught me, father.
FO300022806	Bah! You are my son! Be proud! You collect more slaves than anyone, brag for once in your life!
FO300022807	I do not care! Let them see that I am proud of my boy! You have nothing to be ashamed of, Jotun!
FO300022808	Please, father, people are watching.
FO300022809	You embarrass me, father.
FO300022810	I talk when I have something to say.
FO300022811	Don't have much to say.
FO300022812	You don't really say much, do you?
FO300022813	Why are you always so quiet? You just sort of hang around, you don't say much.
FO300022814	What?
FO300022815	Yes?
FO300022816	You're kidding, right? You have to be.
FO300022817	How about you appreciate my foot up your ass?
FO300022818	PFTalkRichterGrouse3
FO300022819	I'm just saying, sometimes you've got to appreciate the small things.
FO300022820	It's just that if you're bored all the time, you're not appreciating how good we have it.
FO300022821	I don't see where that's a problem.
FO300022822	So? I like to keep myself busy, so what?
FO300022823	You always say that. Are you ever not bored?
FO300022824	You're always bored. There could be another great war out here and you'd be complaining about being bored.
FO300022825	Yeah, I did. And that's too long to go between shootings for me.
FO300022826	Oh yeah. Well, I was drunk then. I barely remember.
FO300022827	What are you talking about, you shot someone this morning! That guy who showed up and tried to run when he figured out where he was!
FO300022828	Didn't you just shoot someone yesterday?
FO300022829	Man, as dull as it is down here, I really wonder if I'm ever going to get to shoot anyone again.
FO300022830	Goddamn, I hate this fucking job some days. It's been far too long since I shot someone.
FO300022831	Pfft. I wish. I ain't seen a damn thing all day.
FO300022832	Not a damn thing. No ants, no Wasters. Nothing. It's been boring as shit.
FO300022833	That's more like it! Show some initiative, dammit, before I sell you off and give one of those fools in the cage your job!
FO300022834	Forty, if you were any dumber, I'd make a signpost out of you.
FO300022835	Okay, yeah. I see what you mean. I'll get on it right away, Eulogy.
FO300022836	Have you suddenly gone blind, Forty? Do I need to replace my blind second-in-command? Look around! You see what I'm talking about now?
FO300022837	Nothing wrong? Have you lost your mind? You've got a loose cage over there, you got people loitering over there, and where is my dog?
FO300022838	What are you talking about, man? There's nothing wrong out here. Everything looks just fine to me.
FO300022839	What am I supposed to be looking at? It looks fine to me.
FO300022840	PFTalkEulogyJonesClover4
FO300022841	Okay, okay. I'm sorry...
FO300022842	Yes, daddy. I'm sorry, daddy.
FO300022843	We've talked about this before, haven't we? So why would you think that nagging me would actually help?
FO300022844	That's not your call, and hasn't ever been. You leave her alone, except when I tell you not to. Got it?
FO300022845	Why are you bothering me, Clover? Hmm? What do you want?
FO300022846	What do you want now?
FO300022847	PFTalkEulogyJonesCrimson4
FO300022848	Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
FO300022849	Did I speak Communese to you? I said that I don't want to talk about it. You will be quiet, or you will regret it.
FO300022850	Why are you still talking after I told you to be quiet? I don't want to have to repeat myself again.
FO300022851	Whatever you have to say, it can wait. You're not here to talk.
FO300022852	Don't start, Crimson. I'm not in the mood.
FO300022853	PFTalkCutterEulogyJones4
FO300022854	Nah. I know you run your shit straight. Keep up the good work.
FO300022855	Ahh, doc. You keep us walking around and making money. That's why we keep you around.
FO300022856	Here you go, Eulogy. The usual cut. Count it if you'd like.
FO300022857	Here's your cut. It's small. Maybe convince your boys to get hurt more and I'll be bringing more in.
FO300022858	That's right, it is just business. So where's my money?
FO300022859	Our relationship is strictly business, Eulogy. You know that.
FO300022860	Good day, Eulogy. And need I remind you that I'm old enough to be your mother. Ours is a business relationship only.
FO300022861	PFTalkCrimsonClover4
FO300022862	Keep running your mouth, Crimson. That's why he don't like you no more.
FO300022863	Hrmph. It's not my fault that I'm the favorite. You don't need to be so bitter.
FO300022864	PFTalkCrimsonClover3
FO300022865	Why do you always have to try to prove something to me? Do you think I care who Eulogy likes better? Seriously?
FO300022866	Clover, I will smack the shit out of you. Can't you just shut up and leave me alone?
FO300022867	You should go talk to him, maybe he'll buy you off of Mr. Eulogy since daddy's gotten tired of you.
FO300022868	I was just thinking that you might want to go introduce yourself, in case Mr. Eulogy finally wants to sell you off.
FO300022869	You should go talk to her, maybe she'll buy you off of Mr. Eulogy since daddy's gotten tired of you.
FO300022870	I was just thinking that you might want to go introduce yourself, in case Mr. Eulogy finally wants to sell you off.
FO300022871	Yeah, he don't look like much, though. Skin's all pasty, like he grew up in a Vault or something.
FO300022872	Yeah, I've seen him. What about it?
FO300022873	Yeah, she don't look like much, though. Skin's all pasty, like she grew up in a Vault or something.
FO300022874	Yeah, I've seen her. What about it?
FO300022875	What? Sorry? Try that again.
FO300022876	I'm sorry, what was that?
FO300022877	PFTalkCrimsonEulogyJones3
FO300022878	<sigh> I'm sorry.
FO300022879	<grumble> Sorry, Eulogy.
FO300022880	What have I said about backtalk, Crimson? Hmm? What have I said?
FO300022881	Are you talking back to me? Because the only thing I hate more than having to repeat myself is being talked back to.
FO300022882	I'm right here, Eulogy. There's no need to yell.
FO300022883	Why do you have to yell all the time, Eulogy? I'm standing right here.
FO300022884	Well now I forgot what I wanted because I was too busy yelling at you. See what you've done?
FO300022885	Please forgive me, daddy. It won't happen again, just tell me what you need. Anything! I'll do anything!
FO300022886	I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Let me make it up to you! Tell me what you want!
FO300022887	Haven't I always said that I hate to wait? Why you always have to make me wait? What's wrong with you?
FO300022888	Damn right, you're sorry. When I say something, you better listen! Hell, you should know what I want before I even open my mouth!
FO300022889	Right away, daddy. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!
FO300022890	Yes, daddy? I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! What do you need?
FO300022891	Eulogy cares about one thing: Eulogy. That's it. And the sooner your dumb ass realizes that, the better off we'll all be.
FO300022892	Someday, you're going to realize that Eulogy don't give a shit about either of us.
FO300022893	Dammit, I should have known better than to try and talk sense to you.
FO300022894	I can't even talk to you. Get out of my face.
FO300022895	Pfft. You're just mad because I'm daddy's favorite.
FO300022896	I just know who Mr. Eulogy likes better, and as soon as you figure it out too, we'll all be happier.
FO300022897	PFTalkCloverCrimson2
FO300022898	Why do you have to be like that? I'm just trying to talk to you and you have to come at me with that shit?
FO300022899	Were they talking about how bad you look again? I mean, I hate to break it to you: they're right.
FO300022900	You mean about how Mr. Eulogy don't like you no more? About how he barely even looks at you when I'm around?
FO300022901	PFTalkCarolinaRedYmir4
FO300022902	Ah, Red! this is why I like you! Always making jokes! You want a drink?
FO300022903	See? This is what I mean. But you know what they say about mean women? Sooner or later, someone will accidentally shoot them while on a mission.
FO300022904	Ymir, let's be honest -- I'd sooner die than let you anywhere near my bunk. But feel free to send that boy of yours any time.
FO300022905	PFTalkCarolinaRedYmir2
FO300022906	Why are you always so mean? All I ever am is nice to you, but it's always "Ymir go away, you smell" or "Ymir, get me a drink and then go away".
FO300022907	Oh, good. I always love questions from my favorite smelly barman.
FO300022908	Is this where you start drunkenly hitting on me? Because it's a little bit early in the day for that, Ymir.
FO300022909	PFTalkBronsonBleak4
FO300022910	Good, Bronson. Don't let me down.
FO300022911	Alright, Bronson. No screw ups this time, got it?
FO300022912	That deal we made, we're still square, right? You know what you need to do?
FO300022913	You remember what I asked you before? The deal we had? Can you do it soon? I'm worried that we're running out of time.
FO300022914	I'm sorry that you think that way. I hope that one day, you come around. I'm here to help you if that happens.
FO300022915	I worry about you, son. Just think about what I said.
FO300022916	It's hard here, boy, trust me. I been a slave for thirty years. But you need to find your peace inside yourself, not at the bottom of a bottle.
FO300022917	I'll never claim that it's easy living this life, but drinking is just going to put you in your grave faster than slavery will. That's no way to go.
FO300022918	Well, you know how they like to mess with you? They used to mess with me too. "See what fits inside a breadbox". It's something I'd rather forget.
FO300022919	Well, you know how these Slavers have a mean streak, especially to new slaves? Well, they used to play a game that I'd rather not think about.
FO300022920	Now that's an odd question. Why would you want to know about that?
FO300022921	Where did I get my name? Why do you care about that, Bronson?
FO300022922	All right, all right. You know where to find me if you change your mind.
FO300022923	Okay, Breadbox. But if you ever do change your mind, I'd love to help you.
FO300022924	I'm fine right where I am, Bleak. There's more to this life than always fighting to change things. Sometimes, there is greater peace in acceptance.
FO300022925	Enough! I've made my decision. I'd rather live my life out here as happily as I can than die on some damn fool escape. Now, leave me alone.
FO300022926	Whatever you're up to, girl, I want nothing to do with it. I'm too old to be involved in these crazy escape plans of yours.
FO300022927	I don't even want to hear about it. I'm fine right where I am, thank you very much. Keep your plans to yourself.
FO300022928	Fine, fine. But when you get your head popped, don't say that I didn't warn you.
FO300022929	Fine, girl, that's fine. Just keep the rest of us out of it. And don't stand near me when they finally do pop your collar.
FO300022930	I don't care, Breadbox. I'm getting out of here. Stay if you want, just keep out of my way, or I'll assume that you're with them.
FO300022931	PFTalkBleakBreadbox2
FO300022932	I've been alive far too long to let some crazy plan get my head blown off. It ain't a bad life, you know. One you get used to it.
FO300022933	Keep your voice down, old man. Listen, if you're not part of the solution, then you're part of the problem. Help or shut up.
FO300022934	You you shut up before they hear you? Listen, I don't judge you, if you want to stay here, fine. Whatever. Just stay out of my way.
FO300022935	Bronson! What is this? I didn't ask for this! You were supposed to get me one of the detonators! I don't even know what this is!
FO300022936	Here you go, Bleak. Just like you asked.
FO300022937	You got the right one this time? Are you serious? Here, let me see. Hand it to me.
FO300022938	Really? You did? Bronson I could kiss you! Here, hand it to me. Slowly.
FO300022939	10 caps says I can kill you before the guards get here.
FO300022940	That's it. GUARDS!
FO300022941	Sorry, I'm not interested in your offer.
FO300022942	Oh, and I wouldn't bother running back to Sierra and warning her. She won't even understand what you're talking about.
FO300022943	She may be a hottie, but she's a bit vacant in the smarts department.
FO300022944	Yeah, sure. I'm always for making more caps.
FO300022945	Thought you might. Good. I'll see you soon then.
FO300022946	Never mind.
FO300022947	He he! You're so silly!
FO300022948	No, I think he just wants to get into your pants.
FO300022949	That's so silly! Why would a man want to wear a pair of these filthy woman's pants? Doesn't make sense.
FO300022950	I bet you and him cooked up that line just to make me smile! Well, mission accomplished!
FO300022951	Did you know Ronald has offered to buy Quantum from me?
FO300022952	He has? Ohhhh! That sweetheart! I knew he'd help me!
FO300022953	All that guy does is watch out for me all the time.
FO300022954	Look, I've got things to do. I'm not interested.
FO300022955	Fine. Oh, and I wouldn't bother running back to Sierra and warning her about our little chat. She won't even understand what you're talking about.
FO300022956	She may be a looker, but she's a bit vacant in the smarts department.
FO300022957	Just what is it you need me to do?
FO300022958	I know she's asked you to find her some Nuka-Cola Quantum. Heck, she asks everyone that wanders through here.
FO300022959	What I'm proposing is you still look for the drinks, but instead of bringing it to her, you bring it to me.
FO300022960	She'll be so impressed that I got all the Nuka-Cola for her, she'll melt in my arms like butter.
FO300022961	I pay you the same she was going to pay, and everyone's happy.
FO300022962	I know she's asked you to find her some Nuka-Cola Quantum. Heck, she asks everyone that wanders through here.
FO300022963	What I'm proposing is you still look for the drinks, but instead of bringing it to her, you bring it to me.
FO300022964	She'll be so impressed that I got all the Nuka-Cola for her, she'll melt in my arms like butter.
FO300022965	I pay you the same she was going to pay, and everyone's happy.
FO300022966	Can't say I blame you.
FO300022967	Now you're speaking my language.
FO300022968	Well, only problem is she won't give it up for me. That's where you come into the picture.
FO300022969	That's disgusting!
FO300022970	What are you, some kind of choir boy? Bah, maybe you're just not old enough to understand yet.
FO300022971	Needless to say, she's got what I want. That's where you come into the picture.
FO300022972	What are you, a nun? Bah, maybe you're just not old enough to understand yet.
FO300022973	Needless to say, she's got what I want. That's where you come into the picture.
FO300022974	Nope, I still don't get it.
FO300022975	New to this stuff, eh kid?
FO300022976	Well, let's just say that she has something I want to get a hold of. That's where you enter the picture.
FO300022977	I don't have time for this nonsense.
FO300022978	All right, suit yourself.
FO300022979	What are you driving at?
FO300022980	Wow, you are as naive as you look.
FO300022981	I'm not messing with anything.
FO300022982	Good. I aim to keep it that way.
FO300022983	She's a fine woman. I'd love to get closer to her if you know what I mean.
FO300022984	She never said anything about you two being together.
FO300022985	Well, that's likely because it's none of anyone's business but ours.
FO300022986	She's one hot lady though, am I right?
FO300022987	Well, that's likely because it's none of anyone's business but ours.
FO300022988	But hey she's a fine looking lady. I mean, you're no slouch either, but a man has his standards you know?
FO300022989	Screw you, buddy! What are you, her husband?
FO300022990	Nope. I'm not the marrying type.
FO300022991	Look, I'm just trying to make sure no one messes with her. You'd do the same to protect your woman too.
FO300022992	Wow. Okay, I get the message. Take it easy.
FO300022993	Look, I'm just trying to make sure no one messes up my chances with her.
FO300022994	None of your damn business.
FO300022995	I was checking out Sierra's Nuka-Cola Collection.
FO300022996	That better be all you were checking out. I don't like guys messing with my woman.
FO300022997	That's all huh? Better be.
FO300022998	Because I warn you, I don't like anyone messing around with my woman.
FO300022999	What's it to you?
FO300023000	Because I'm making sure that no one messes with her. She's my girl, you know.
FO300023001	Hey hey. No need to be that way, beautiful.
FO300023002	It's cool anyway, Sierra and I are already hooked up.
FO300023003	I just don't want any other chicks messing with her head. You know what I mean?
FO300023004	What kind of recipes can you make with Nuka-Cola Quantum?
FO300023005	Well, the stuff is so rare, I only know one. It's called Mississippi Quantum Pie. It's delicious!
FO300023006	If you want me to make you one, I can. Just bring me some flour, vodka, and a Nuka-Cola Quantum.
FO300023007	I can whip it up in no time.
FO300023008	Sure! Just give me a second, and I'll have it ready for you.
FO300023009	Can you make me a Mississippi Quantum Pie?
FO300023010	Oops! I need some vodka to make the pie, sweetie.
FO300023011	Can you make me a Mississippi Quantum Pie?
FO300023012	Oops! I need some flour to make the pie, sweetie.
FO300023013	Can you make me a Mississippi Quantum Pie?
FO300023014	Oops! I need a Nuka-Cola Quantum to make the pie, sweetie.
FO300023015	Can you make me a Mississippi Quantum Pie?
FO300023016	You silly! I still need flour and vodka to make the pie.
FO300023017	Can you make me a Mississippi Quantum Pie?
FO300023018	You silly! I still need Nuka-Cola Quantum and vodka to make the pie.
FO300023019	Can you make me a Mississippi Quantum Pie?
FO300023020	You silly! I still need Nuka-Cola Quantum and flour to make the pie.
FO300023021	Can you make me a Mississippi Quantum Pie?
FO300023022	If you have the ingredients, I can make a pie for you. All it takes is some flour, vodka and Nuka-Cola Quantum.
FO300023023	Tell me again what you need for Mississippi Quantum Pie.
FO300023024	Has Ronald been bothering you?
FO300023025	Oh no, not at all. In fact, I've been getting lots of nice attention from him lately!
FO300023026	Ever since he brought the Quantum to fill my machine, he keeps whispering sweet nothings to me.
FO300023027	That sweetheart? Nah. Come to think of it, he hasn't even visited me in a while.
FO300023028	I wonder why. Ah well, I'm sure I'll see him soon enough!
FO300023029	Oh no. He's such a cutie pie. He never bothers me!
FO300023030	I have some more Quantum for you.
FO300023031	You do! You darling!
FO300023032	Well, as always, I'll be glad to take them off your hands. And now that my machine is full I can drink these to my heart's desire!
FO300023033	Goodie! I was hoping you'd bring me more!
FO300023034	Keep it up, there's probably plenty more out there.
FO300023035	I was just wondering when I'd see you again, and poof, here you are!
FO300023036	Ohhhh sweet Quantum, come to mama!
FO300023037	I'm amazed you're finding so many more bottles of Quantum out there. Imagine that.
FO300023038	Well, don't give up looking. Keep finding more and bringing it to me.
FO300023039	Why would I want that piss water? Get it away from me.
FO300023040	PFTalkHowsItGoingResponse1
FO300023041	Not bad, man. Not bad at all.
FO300023042	PFTalkHowAreYouResponse1
FO300023043	Swell.
FO300023044	Peachy.
FO300023045	PFTalkHiResponse1
FO300023046	Right on, Eulogy.
FO300023047	Hey, Eulogy.
FO300023048	Nothin' at all, Eulogy.
FO300023049	Not now. Someone will hear.
FO300023050	Not now. They're watching.
FO300023051	Get out of my face.
FO300023052	Get the fuck away from me, meat.
FO300023053	I'm too busy for you right now, man.
FO300023054	Got my eye on you, man.
FO300023055	Man, fuck off.
FO300023056	So I look like I wanna be talking to you, scrub?
FO300023057	Back off before I put a bullet in you.
FO300023058	Get the fuck away from me.
FO300023059	Whatever.
FO300023060	Leave me alone, scrub.
FO300023061	Hahahaha! Yeah, right.
FO300023062	Oh, please. Kid, come back after your balls have dropped.
FO300023063	Hello yourself.
FO300023064	Keep walkin', boy.
FO300023065	That's cute. Go play.
FO300023066	Stuff it.
FO300023067	Take it up with Eulogy.
FO300023068	<grunts>
FO300023069	Hello there, little man.
FO300023070	Hello there, pretty girl.
FO300023071	I see you later in the barracks.
FO300023072	You act like we're strangers?
FO300023073	Don't mess with me, or you'll end up like Frank! Hahahaha!
FO300023074	Hahaha! You owe me a drink!
FO300023075	Hey there.
FO300023076	S'up?
FO300023077	Hello.
FO300023078	Whatever.
FO300023079	Fuck off.
FO300023080	Yeah, nice try.
FO300023081	Hey.
FO300023082	I suppose I can do that. Just don't let me down again, Bronson. I need your help.
FO300023083	Okay, Bronson. One more.
FO300023084	How many times have we gone over this, Bronson? Can't you stay sober enough to do one little thing?
FO300023085	I'm starting to feel like I can't trust your drunk ass, Bronson. How many times is it that you've screwed up?
FO300023086	I mean, it's not the most heroic of reasons, but killing the AntAgonizer is a noble act regardless of the motivation, I guess.
FO300023087	Quickly, she's already inside the front gate!
FO300023088	Whatever. I just want her dead so I can get paid.
FO300023089	You're a rebellious little soldier, but I respect your strength. You may work with my colony for now. Humanity shall fall and our colony shall feast!
FO300023090	Who dares interrupt my celebration?
FO300023091	It must be the Mechanist! His meddlesome metal army is already inside! Destroy them!
FO300023092	I don't give a damn about your court. I just want the Mechanist dead.
FO300023093	The AntAgonizer does not listen to reason. She does not understand true human emotions, like mercy or love.
FO300023094	She's nothing more than an animal, and you can no more talk her into surrender than you can play chess with a Mole Rat!
FO300023095	But I will not stop you from trying. I only hope that you live long enough to learn the error of your ways.
FO300023096	There's bound to be a peaceful solution. I'll try to convince her to give up.
FO300023097	Ha! When it comes to the struggle for power, there is no peace! There is only strength and conflict!
FO300023098	Yes, go to the Mechanist and talk. Meanwhile, I will stay here and prepare for war!
FO300023099	There's bound to be a peaceful solution. I'll try to convince him to give up.
FO300023100	In all of my time against the AntAgonizer, I've never been able to get to her vile sanctum.
FO300023101	But with your cunning aid, I'm sure we'll both be able to penetrate her fiendish nest with ease!
FO300023102	Quickly, she's already inside the front gate!
FO300023103	Let's go put an end to the AntAgonizer once and for all!
FO300023104	Excellent! Rise, my loyal soldier, and prepare for battle! We leave to fight the Mechanist immediately! Humanity shall fall; our colony shall feast!
FO300023105	Who dares interrupt my celebration?
FO300023106	It must be the Mechanist! His meddlesome metal army is already inside! Destroy them!
FO300023107	I swear, we will destroy the Mechanist and his pitiful toys!
FO300023108	I'm afraid I don't have another suit, though.
FO300023109	But we can deal with that problem later. We've got bigger ants to fry! Now, how to proceed?
FO300023110	I suppose you're right. Maybe we can work together.
FO300023111	Yes, you would join me in fighting the Mechanist! Him and his little tin men, made by humans to kill humans for other humans.
FO300023112	Would you turn your back on humanity's failings? Would you join the ant court in our destruction of the Mechanist and his hubris?
FO300023113	Maybe you're right. Maybe I should join your side.
FO300023114	Long ago, I was a mere citizen like yourself. Beyond a talent for computers, I had no power in this world.
FO300023115	But then the AntAgonizer attacked, and killed someone very dear to me. The damage was too much for me to fix her. But I knew what I had to do.
FO300023116	That tragedy burned away the weakness of my previous life, and in the fires of revenge, the Mechanist was forged!
FO300023117	Why did you decide to become the Mechanist?
FO300023118	Lies! Unlike the rest of you peasants, I was born for greatness. I was never meant to crawl in the muck of mankind!
FO300023119	But the ants knew my destiny. When I was but a larva, they rescued me from my filthy human family.
FO300023120	They saw my nobility, and they saved me from a human life of fear and pain. Now, I will lead them to their glorious future!
FO300023121	Without your suit, you're just a normal human like anyone else.
FO300023122	Long ago, I was a mere citizen like yourself. Beyond a talent for computers, I had no power in this world.
FO300023123	But then the AntAgonizer attacked, and killed someone very dear to me. The damage was too much for me to fix her. But I knew what I had to do.
FO300023124	That tragedy burned away the weakness of my previous life, and in the fires of revenge, the Mechanist was forged!
FO300023125	Why did you decide to become the Mechanist?
FO300023126	Lies! Unlike the rest of you peasants, I was born for greatness. I was never meant to crawl in the muck of mankind!
FO300023127	But the ants knew my destiny. When I was but a larva, they rescued me from my filthy human family.
FO300023128	They saw my nobility, and they saved me from a human life of fear and pain. Now, I will lead them to their glorious future!
FO300023129	Without your suit, you're just a normal human like anyone else.
FO300023130	Lies! Slander! I'll never let you compare a noble hero like myself to that, that base villain!
FO300023131	But now it's all clear to me. You're an agent sent by the AntAgonizer, using your honeyed words to trick me into letting down my defenses!
FO300023132	Well, the jig is up! Prepare to face the burning lasers of justice, evildoer!
FO300023133	You just want to keep fighting the AntAgonizer. You're as bad as she is.
FO300023134	Of course I do! Do you think I'm insane?!
FO300023135	Why, with this suit, I'm more than any ant could hope to be! And ten times more than any mere mortal like you or the Mechanist!
FO300023136	But now, the time for your prattle has come to an end. If you shall not bow before your ant queen, then bleed before the AntAgonizer!
FO300023137	Why, you aren't a citizen at all! You must be a vile minion of my arch-nemesis, the AntAgonizer! Obviously, we must battle at once!
FO300023138	I'm afraid I can't allow you to persist in your evil plans. Percival, attack this villain!
FO300023139	I've had enough of you and your silly costume. Get ready to die.
FO300023140	My loyal subjects are the result of 100 million years of evolution, and they'll outlive your pitiful kind. We'll see who has the last laugh!
FO300023141	Your ants are a joke. Time to die, crazy lady!
FO300023142	Oh! Well, in that case, welcome! Welcome, dear citizen!
FO300023143	You'll be my sidekick! I hereby grant you the title of Mechano-Lad!
FO300023144	Well then, my trusty chum, shall we prepare to defeat our nemesis?
FO300023145	I've come to help you get rid of the AntAgonizer.
FO300023146	Oh! Well, in that case, welcome! Welcome, dear citizen!
FO300023147	You'll be my sidekick! I hereby grant you the title of Mechano-Lass!
FO300023148	Well then, my trusty chum, shall we prepare to defeat our nemesis?
FO300023149	I've come to help you get rid of the AntAgonizer.
FO300023150	This is an unexpected surprise! A human who understands its place.
FO300023151	One who realizes that ants are destined to walk this land, while humans and their toys are destined only to rot beneath it?
FO300023152	Perhaps, even a human who wants to join the winning side, yes? One that would humbly beg admittance to the ant queen's court?
FO300023153	Relax. I'm here to help you get rid of that Mechanist character.
FO300023154	I realize you mean well, but I'm afraid you're being naive. The AntAgonizer is a madwoman, and the only thing that will stop her is force.
FO300023155	As much as I wish peace were an option, the AntAgonizer is too deluded, too inhuman to listen to reason.
FO300023156	Sadly, sometimes the scaly claw of tyranny must be destroyed by the cold, unfeeling pincers of justice!
FO300023157	I'm just here to talk. We can find a peaceful way to stop this fighting.
FO300023158	Ha ha! You would walk here and presume to command me?
FO300023159	Humanity's time has come to an end. Your kind died because it knew only petty bickering and wars.
FO300023160	But not so, the noble ant! It works with its brethren, knowing only loyalty and duty. And this is why they have grown, while humanity crumbled!
FO300023161	Once I've finished with that pathetic Mechanist, I will be free to spread my colonies across the Wastes!
FO300023162	Your days of terrorizing the town are over. Give up and you won't get hurt.
FO300023163	Honey, I'll take anything you feel like paying for.
FO300023164	Only if you're buying it, big guy.
FO300023165	I don't need help, Bleak. But thank you.
FO300023166	I wouldn't hold your breath, girl. I'm quite content.
FO300023167	There's a good girl.
FO300023168	That's better.
FO300023169	I'm sorry, Sir.
FO300023170	Look, you rotting piece of shit! Tell me what you know or it's splatter time!
FO300023171	All right! I'll tell you! Please, just don't hurt me!
FO300023172	Moriarty keeps a computer terminal in the back. On it, he keeps all of the dirty secrets of Megaton.
FO300023173	If you can get onto that terminal, I bet he has information on your Dad.
FO300023174	Now, get away from me, smoothskin. If Moriarty even suspects I told you this, I'm a dead Ghoul.
FO300023175	If you know anyone else that can help, I'd appreciate it.
FO300023176	Moriarty is your best bet. I wish you luck. Now, I have to get back to work, or I'll be answering to him too.
FO300023177	Gob, please. If you know anything about my father, you need to tell me.
FO300023178	I was like you once. I wandered into town looking for an escape from this stupid joke of a body I'm trapped in. Now look at me.
FO300023179	Very well. Moriarty keeps a computer terminal in the back. On it, he keeps all of the goings on in Megaton.
FO300023180	If you can get onto that terminal, I bet he has information on your Dad.
FO300023181	Now, get away from me, smoothskin. If Moriarty even suspects I told you this, I'm a dead Ghoul.
FO300023182	Look, if you know something, you'd better tell me!
FO300023183	Look, smoothskin. I've told you all I dare. Moriarty doesn't like me chatting with the customers like this.
FO300023184	If he even thought I was talking to you, he'd tan my hide!
FO300023185	Let me get back to work now before he sees us.
FO300023186	I talked to Moriarty already and he's trying to charge me for the info.
FO300023187	Sigh. That's his way. Always putting caps before people's lives.
FO300023188	I'm sorry, I really must get back to work. I can't get involved. I'm so sorry.
FO300023189	Sounds good to me.
FO300023190	Well then, let's make a deal!
FO300023191	Finally! Let's get down to business.
FO300023192	Actually, let me pick another Theme.
FO300023193	Certainly!
FO300023194	Let me ask about something else.
FO300023195	Sure.
FO300023196	Fine.
FO300023197	I'm interested in the Pre-War Theme.
FO300023198	Feeling a bit nostalgic are we?
FO300023199	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300023200	Still want to live in the past, huh? Well, forget it. Those days are long gone.
FO300023201	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300023202	I'm interested in the Science Theme.
FO300023203	You're the intellectual type, eh?
FO300023204	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300023205	Sounds great, Poindexter.
FO300023206	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300023207	I'm interested in the Wasteland Explorer Theme.
FO300023208	Longing for the great outdoors are we?
FO300023209	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300023210	Well, if you have to feel like your out in the Wasteland, I guess this is for you. Me, I like to stay out of the sun.
FO300023211	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300023212	I'm interested in the Raider Theme.
FO300023213	Into the blood and guts look, eh?
FO300023214	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300023215	Into the blood and guts look? Reminds me of my old home.
FO300023216	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300023217	I'm interested in the Vault Theme.
FO300023218	Feeling a bit homesick are we?
FO300023219	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300023220	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300023221	<Say nothing.>
FO300023222	You're an odd one, aren't you?
FO300023223	You don't have a problem with killing all those people?
FO300023224	Oh no. I'm certainly rather sore about all that. But certain sacrifices must be made.
FO300023225	Besides, Burke assured me that bomb was quite unstable. I asked Burke to suggest they vacate.
FO300023226	It was all a matter of time. Think of it as helping speed along the process of natural selection. Don't lose any sleep over it.
FO300023227	You've got to clear away the past to make room for the future.
FO300023228	Well said! Indeed! You've got the entrepreneurial spirit! It gives me hope to see young people, such as yourself, with real heads on their shoulders.
FO300023229	I complained off hand one day about how I thought that heap of metal on the horizon was a bit of an eyesore. Mister Burke offered to take care of it.
FO300023230	Burke is such an agreeable man, isn't he? I don't know how I got along without him. I practically don't have to think about things anymore.
FO300023231	He takes care of everything. I seldom even have to ask. He's a real go-getter, that one. We need more men like him if we're to rebuild the world.
FO300023232	What are you shooting at out there?
FO300023233	Whatever. I never knew her anyway.
FO300023234	You "weren't prepared"? My mother is dead!
FO300023235	As I said, I am sorry. I'm afraid I can't go back and change the past.
FO300023236	I understand. I'm sure you did everything you could.
FO300023237	Candace, it's Ralph. Tell dad there's no way in hell I'm spending nuclear Armageddon trapped with him in a fucking closet.
FO300023238	You can have my number. It's "6." Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a mushroom cloud to walk into. Have a happy holocaust!
FO300023239	KellerFamilyHolotape3
FO300023240	I'm heading to the Vault now. I'll do whatever I can to get inside. My number of the passcode was "7," right?
FO300023241	KellerFamilyHolotape2
FO300023242	Before they took him into custody, Alex he sent each of us one number of the four-digit code. That way, we all have to be together to get in.
FO300023243	Oh, and I'm not pregnant. So no worries.
FO300023244	KellerFamilyHolotape1
FO300023245	Tina, it's me. Your brother? Alex? Listen, mom would kill me if she knew I was contacting you, but she's being an impossible bitch right now.
FO300023246	Look, no matter what it takes, the whole damn Keller family's gonna ride this storm out, but you've got to get your ass home. Now!
FO300023247	You there! Burke! Explain your business in Megaton.
FO300023248	I'm sorry? Sheriff, what are you hollering about?
FO300023249	You know damn well what I'm talking about. The bomb! You're trying to blow it up! Have you lost your goddamned mind?
FO300023250	I'm placing you under arrest, Burke. At least until I figure out what the hell's going on around here.
FO300023251	This isn't open to discussion! You're coming with me.
FO300023252	Why do you knuckle draggers always insist on doing things the hard way? Very well, Sheriff. Lead the way.
FO300023253	Actually, I think he was just kidding.
FO300023254	You better stop playing games with me, boy!
FO300023255	You better stop playing games with me, girl!
FO300023256	He gave me this Fusion Pulse Charge to rig to the bomb. Here, take it.
FO300023257	Jesus! Gimme that thing!
FO300023258	Let's go find this Burke character. You're about to get an education in Wasteland justice.
FO300023259	Jesus! Gimme that thing!
FO300023260	Thanks. If Burke steps within a mile of Megaton, he's a dead man.
FO300023261	What if he asks someone else to explode the bomb? You should do something.
FO300023262	Good point. Come with me. You're about to get an education in Wasteland justice.
FO300023263	He's long gone by now. But I swear: If he steps within a mile of Megaton, he's a fucking dead man.
FO300023264	Too many lives are at stake, Burke! I'm going to defuse that bomb.
FO300023265	All right. Say I decide to help you. What's in it for me?
FO300023266	You mean besides doing the world a favor by removing this pestilent scab of a town?
FO300023267	Why, you'd be rewarded most handsomely! My employer is a very generous man. If it's bottle caps and luxury you're seeking. You shall have it!
FO300023268	Simms is an idiot. He prides himself on his position as mayor and sheriff of this scrapyard.
FO300023269	Here. These letters arrived for you while you were gone. I'm not a fucking post office you know.
FO300023270	Here. These damn love letters have been waiting around for you.
FO300023271	This letter came for you. I run a saloon, not a post office. But does anyone listen? No. Well, go on take the damn letter already.
FO300023272	Another of those damn love letters arrived for you.
FO300023273	Take the Fusion Pulse Charge. Place it into the bomb. Then meet me at Tenpenny Tower. There I will show you what true power is.
FO300023274	You wait here my dear. I have some important business to attend to. But you won't be waiting long. I shall send for you soon.
FO300023275	I have a "proposition" of my own. Would you like to hear it, Mister Burke?
FO300023276	Oh really? Is that so?
FO300023277	You may not think much of this town, but you're a guest in my home, and I'd advise you to behave as such.
FO300023278	I hope I've made myself perfectly clear.
FO300023279	Whatever. I don't plan on sticking around very long, anyway.
FO300023280	Fine. Enjoy your stay in Megaton. Don't get into any trouble and we'll go on pretending we're friends.
FO300023281	I can see about disarming that bomb for you.
FO300023282	Oh, all right. Fine. But listen here. Just take a look at it first. Go easy.
FO300023283	If you get the job done, there'll be 100 caps in it for you.
FO300023284	One day, that thing's going to go off. You're living on borrowed time.
FO300023285	So long as you stay away from the bomb, I see my chances of a long life improving. I hope we understand each other.
FO300023286	Who would build a town around a bomb? That's crazy!
FO300023287	It's not like the place was put up over night. Megaton's been here for decades, been growing and growing ever since.
FO300023288	Started out as a small settlement of people trying to get into Vault 101. When they were denied, they stuck around here.
FO300023289	Some of 'em started worshipping the thing like a god. Now we've got a whole goddamn Church. They're nuts, no doubt, but mostly harmless.
FO300023290	By now, most people don't give a shit. They figure if it ain't gone off by now, it never will. I respectfully disagree.
FO300023291	Don't you think someone should disarm that thing?
FO300023292	I don't trust any of the locals to tinker with it. Besides, most people don't even realize it's still a threat.
FO300023293	And hell, Cromwell and those crazies from the Church of Atom, they worship the damn thing.
FO300023294	Why? Do you think you got the know-how to disarm it? For good?
FO300023295	I'm just messing with you. Relax!
FO300023296	You're dead.
FO300023297	Let's do it, then!
FO300023298	Ha! I'm just messing with you.
FO300023299	I want your hat. What do you think about that?
FO300023300	I think you're suicidal. Try me.
FO300023301	I want that hat. What do you think about that?
FO300023302	There's a new sheriff in town! It's time to die, asshole.
FO300023303	I ain't killed a drifter in weeks. This should be fun!
FO300023304	<Say nothing.>
FO300023305	You don't scare me.
FO300023306	You got something you want to prove, boy?
FO300023307	You got something you want to prove, girl?
FO300023308	Right. Message received.
FO300023309	I'm glad we understand each other. Now, is there something I can help you with?
FO300023310	MS11LucasSimmsSayToPlayer
FO300023311	Well I'll be damned. You're from that vault! Vault 101! Ha ha! I ain't seen one of those jumpsuits in a LONG time!
FO300023312	I'll be damned. Another newcomer.
FO300023313	Once again, my husband, we are at an impasse. I suggest we speak to the Outsider.
FO300023314	How can we preach about peace when all you want to do is keep His gift all to ourselves? That's not what He would want!
FO300023315	The Outsider is here to deliver us from our enemies! To keep this place safely locked away from the Wasteland! Not to exploit us!
FO300023316	And I'm telling you, you've got it all wrong! Why else would He have called for an Outsider's assistance?
FO300023317	I'm not sure I could live with these loonies.
FO300023318	You have a lot of nerve! We've shown you nothing but hospitality and then instead of thanks, you chose to hurl insults?
FO300023319	I'm all for sharing Oasis with the rest of the Wasteland, but if you're an example of what we face in doing so, perhaps it's a mistake!
FO300023320	Why'd you stay here after you recovered?
FO300023321	I felt I owed these people for bringing me back from the brink.
FO300023322	Dying? How awful! What happened to you?
FO300023323	I was a Brotherhood of Steel Outcast. We had a deep patrol out here, looking for some tech and then got jumped by some Deathclaws.
FO300023324	They shredded everyone else and left me bleeding to death. If it wasn't for Oasis and Bloomseer Poplar, I'd be dead right now.
FO300023325	So, how did you end up here?
FO300023326	I was born here, silly!
FO300023327	I was brought here by His will. I heard his calling, and I followed.
FO300023328	I believe only a few are worthy enough to find this place, and I'm honored to be among them.
FO300023329	That's why I dread the day Oasis overgrows its boundaries.
FO300023330	I was brought here by His will. I heard his calling, and I followed. Isn't it wonderful?
FO300023331	Remind me again how you found Oasis.
FO300023332	I was found dying in the Wastes not far from here by a trader caravan. They knew about this place and brought me to Bloomseer Poplar.
FO300023333	She nursed me back to health, and I've stayed ever since.
FO300023334	There isn't much more to the story. I was dying and these people saved my life, so here I'll remain.
FO300023335	Remind me again how you found Oasis.
FO300023336	My father was a healer like myself. He had the most curious books I would read about trees and plants and their medicinal properties.
FO300023337	Many years later, I heard a rumor about a place such as this. I spent a decade in search of it.
FO300023338	I've been in this wonderful place for over fifteen years now.
FO300023339	When my eyes beheld the splendor of Oasis, I knew I'd found a holy place. Tree Father Birch allowed me to stay and I've been here ever since.
FO300023340	What's your opinion of Tree Father Birch and Leaf Mother Laurel?
FO300023341	They're the best parents ever!
FO300023342	I've only known them for a very short time, but when I first arrived they immediately took me in and treated me just like a son.
FO300023343	There aren't many people in the world left like that.
FO300023344	Lately, things have gotten a bit worse between them. It sometimes takes months for them to agree on things.
FO300023345	I know they love each other greatly, but I'm afraid the strain of leadership is tearing them apart.
FO300023346	I wish they wouldn't argue so much. It makes everyone uncomfortable.
FO300023347	I think this place would be lost if it weren't for them.
FO300023348	There's no telling what fate may have befallen the Great One if someone like the godless Raiders had gotten here first.
FO300023349	Where is the entrance to the caves?
FO300023350	The entrance to the caves is to the southwest of the Pavilion.
FO300023351	You'll find the entrance in the southwestern part of Oasis.
FO300023352	Where did the sap come from?
FO300023353	The Liniment was made by Bloomseer Poplar. Her knowledge of His gifts and how they can be used to help us is nothing short of astounding.
FO300023354	Where did the Liniment come from?
FO300023355	Bloomseer Poplar has a unique understanding of the innate power that lay dormant in the plants you see around you.
FO300023356	She created the sap with the knowledge she brought to us from the Wasteland.
FO300023357	Were you aware that Laurel gave me this Liniment?
FO300023358	Of course I am. I know everything that goes on in Oasis. Laurel is free to pursue whatever path she chooses.
FO300023359	A long time ago, it was agreed that the Tree Father and the Leaf Mother hold equal say. I don't seek to change those customs.
FO300023360	I just hope that when the time comes, you'll make the right choice.
FO300023361	Why don't you just travel to Harold's heart on your own?
FO300023362	The Great One has not yet allowed us entry below ground. We were uncertain as to why until you arrived.
FO300023363	I would if I was able, but He will not allow us entry. His roots bar the door, and we have yet to earn the right to pass.
FO300023364	I'd like to ask about something else.
FO300023365	Yes?
FO300023366	Go on.
FO300023367	Okay.
FO300023368	I have some questions about the task you gave me.
FO300023369	Certainly, please ask them.
FO300023370	By all means, ask away.
FO300023371	I give up. Just let me know what you want now.
FO300023372	I heard what my husband wanted you to do. What I propose is an alternative.
FO300023373	The same person that created the sap also created this Liniment. If you can reach His heart, it will assist in making His influence increase.
FO300023374	Instead of centuries, the Wasteland will become green in mere decades! Just imagine how glorious that would be!
FO300023375	I heard what my husband wanted you to do. What I propose is an alternative.
FO300023376	The same person that created the sap also created this Liniment. If you can reach His heart, it will assist in making His influence increase.
FO300023377	Instead of centuries, the Wasteland will become green in mere decades! Just imagine how glorious that would be!
FO300023378	How can I possibly help?
FO300023379	I heard what my husband wanted you to do. What I propose is an alternative.
FO300023380	The same person that created the sap also created this Liniment. If you can reach His heart, it will assist in making His influence increase.
FO300023381	Instead of centuries, the Wasteland will become green in mere decades! Just imagine how glorious that would be!
FO300023382	This is a waste of my time.
FO300023383	I can understand your frustration. Seeing Him in so much pain makes me feel a sense of sadness in my heart too.
FO300023384	Now that you're here, I have a feeling the winds are about to change.
FO300023385	Why don't any of you listen to Harold?
FO300023386	It's upsetting Him to no end, but Birch can't see the pain its causing.
FO300023387	But now that you're here, I have a feeling the winds are about to change.
FO300023388	Doesn't anybody care what your god thinks?
FO300023389	It's upsetting Him to no end, but Birch can't see the pain its causing.
FO300023390	But now that you're here, I have a feeling the winds are about to change.
FO300023391	Good! Free firewood for all!
FO300023392	That's it! You are no longer welcome in Oasis! Get out IMMEDIATELY!
FO300023393	If you remain here against my wishes, we'll have no choice but to put you down!
FO300023394	You don't scare me Birch, and neither does that overgrown weed you call a god.
FO300023395	I've had enough of your blasphemy!
FO300023396	I've tolerated it this long because you're an Outsider, but no more. If you wish to test me again, you'll find yourself banished from Oasis!
FO300023397	Killing him should stop his influence from spreading.
FO300023398	You misinterpret His words, my friend. He wants you to extinguish that which seeks to make Him vulnerable.
FO300023399	If the same sap that you drank to purify yourself could be applied to His heart, it should stop the spread.
FO300023400	I can promise you no harm would come to Him. That's all I ask of you, Outsider. Nothing more, nothing less.
FO300023401	So what can I do to help?
FO300023402	If the same sap that you drank to purify yourself could be applied to His heart, it should stop the spread.
FO300023403	I can promise you no harm would come to Him. That's all I ask of you, Outsider. Nothing more, nothing less.
FO300023404	Did you know that crazy tree thing wants me to kill it?
FO300023405	That's it! You are no longer welcome in Oasis! Get out IMMEDIATELY!
FO300023406	If you remain here against my wishes, we'll have no choice but to put you down!
FO300023407	You don't scare me Birch, and neither does that overgrown weed you call a god.
FO300023408	I've had enough of your blasphemy!
FO300023409	I've tolerated it this long because you're an Outsider, but no more. If you wish to test me again, you'll find yourself banished from Oasis!
FO300023410	Are you aware that Harold wants to die?
FO300023411	Yes, I've been pondering that riddle myself for some time now and I think I know what He's trying to tell us.
FO300023412	The Great One's influence is growing and soon it will break free of the confines of this secluded vale.
FO300023413	We can't allow Oasis to call attention to itself like that. It would be the end of Him.
FO300023414	Did you know your god wants me to kill him?
FO300023415	Yes, I've been pondering that riddle myself for some time now and I think I know what He's trying to tell us.
FO300023416	The Great One's influence is growing and soon it will break free of the confines of this secluded vale.
FO300023417	We can't allow Oasis to call attention to itself like that. It would be the end of Him.
FO300023418	Can we just dispense with all of the religious crap? His name's Harold!
FO300023419	Oh, He's testing you now, just like He tested us!
FO300023420	He wants to see if your faith is strong by spinning these incredible stories. Who else but a god could produce all of this?
FO300023421	Don't worry, you'll soon see things as I do.
FO300023422	He's not a god, Birch. His name's Harold.
FO300023423	Oh, He's testing you now, just like He tested us!
FO300023424	He wants to see if your faith is strong by spinning these incredible stories. Who else but a god could produce all of this?
FO300023425	Don't worry, you'll soon see things as I do.
FO300023426	I'm afraid Harold isn't a god. He's just a human that had some bad luck.
FO300023427	Oh, He's testing you now, just like He tested us!
FO300023428	He wants to see if your faith is strong by spinning these incredible stories. Who else but a god could produce all of this?
FO300023429	Don't worry, you'll soon see things as I do.
FO300023430	FFDCRockCreekHuntersSearch
FO300023431	Let's go, you hairy fucks. I ain't got all day.
FO300023432	Fuckin' Yao Guai.
FO300023433	Get out here, 'Guai. I got a present for you.
FO300023434	Come on out, you smelly bastards.
FO300023435	Yoohoo! Yao Guai! C'mon out!
FO300023436	I did what had to be done.
FO300023437	And well done indeed.
FO300023438	Now GNR can be heard clear across the Capital Wasteland again. That'll give Eden and those Muties something to think about.
FO300023439	And well done indeed.
FO300023440	Now GNR can be heard clear across the Capital Wasteland again. That'll give Eden and those Muties something to think about.
FO300023441	But before I get back to my calling, I bet you wanna hear about that military weapons cache.
FO300023442	And well done indeed.
FO300023443	Now GNR can be heard clear across the Capital Wasteland again. That'll give Eden and those Muties something to think about.
FO300023444	But before I get back to my calling, I bet you wanna hear about your Dad.
FO300023445	Parents? Ha! I was born from the sun and have sand in my veins.
FO300023446	Ha ha! Just messing with you.
FO300023447	This is bullshit! You're blackmailing me!
FO300023448	I'll do whatever it takes to keep the Capital Wasteland free. Whatever. It. Takes.
FO300023449	And right now, without GNR at full strength, my words are being wasted. And that just ain't acceptable.
FO300023450	No way in hell am I getting near a Super Mutant!
FO300023451	Look. You approached me, remember? And no one said this would be a cake walk.
FO300023452	But there's something behind those eyes of yours that screams "I'm the one who can get shit done!"
FO300023453	Your dad had that same look in his eyes too. That's why I'm helping you.
FO300023454	No way, I'm not fetching some stupid dish for you.
FO300023455	You aren't getting the dish for me, you're getting it for YOU.
FO300023456	If you need some time to think it over, that's cool. But the longer GNR is quiet, the longer you have to wait.
FO300023457	Let me think about this. I don't know if I'm ready.
FO300023458	Wow, and here I thought you were in a rush. Whatever, man. Chat me up when you're ready.
FO300023459	You've got yourself a deal.
FO300023460	He he! I sure know how to pick 'em!
FO300023461	You're going to be the best thing that ever happened to Galaxy News in a long time.
FO300023462	If you need any more info, I'll be here waiting for you.
FO300023463	Again with the damn stories. Just get to the point.
FO300023464	Since you're too impatient to listen to the details, I'll get to the point.
FO300023465	The broadcast relay on the Washington Monument needs to be replaced and there's only one replacement for it.
FO300023466	It's the dish off of the old Virgo II Lunar Lander in the Museum of Technology.
FO300023467	How did you know I was looking for my Dad?
FO300023468	Oh come on. This is Three Dog you're talking to. I got my ear to the ground and I hear the wagons coming.
FO300023469	But if you want help, you're going to have to contribute to the Good Fight.
FO300023470	How did you know what I needed?
FO300023471	Oh come on. You're a splitting image of the guy. He's been here before, and now you're here. Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.
FO300023472	You want to find your dad, and it just so happens his location is known to yours truly.
FO300023473	But if you want to know more, you're going to have to contribute to the Good Fight.
FO300023474	Then Rivet City is where I'm headed. Goodbye, Three Dog.
FO300023475	Goodbye. Remember to keep us tuned in while you're out there, and watch yourself.
FO300023476	Rivet City? Where's that?
FO300023477	Well, a whole bunch of eggheads got together and turned a beached aircraft carrier into a town. Pretty cool, huh?
FO300023478	On second thought, maybe I should contribute. What do you have in mind?
FO300023479	Well good. I'm glad to see you realize there's more to life than just what you need; that there's a bigger picture.
FO300023480	Ain't gonna be easy, though. You ready for this?
FO300023481	I know he will. He's always talked about doing what's right.
FO300023482	When your dad passed through here, I spent a good long time talking to him about all kinds of stuff.
FO300023483	He also said something about going to visit a Doctor Li in Rivet City. Then, he left in a hurry.
FO300023484	Look, Three Dog. If I find my Dad, maybe he can help with the Good Fight.
FO300023485	Well, your dad is some sort of scientist type. Some kind of egghead or something.
FO300023486	You really think if you find him he'd help our cause?
FO300023487	Can't you just help me?
FO300023488	There are different fronts to every fight. Galaxy News Radio is one of them.
FO300023489	I need help with the old girl, though, cause she's hurtin'.
FO300023490	I don't give a shit about your "Good Fight." You going to help me or not?
FO300023491	Ok, friend. I've been calm. I've been cool. Now I've had enough of your hostility.
FO300023492	You wanna be all business, fine. I can play like that.
FO300023493	You want help, you help me. End of story. You ready or what?
FO300023494	I don't give a shit about your "Good Fight." You going to help me or not?
FO300023495	Ok, friend. I've been calm. I've been cool. Now I've had enough of your hostility.
FO300023496	You wanna' be all business, fine. I can play like that.
FO300023497	You want daddy, you help me. End of story. You ready or what?
FO300023498	The guys outside are the Brotherhood of Steel? Who are they?
FO300023499	From what I saw, they were the ones who saved your ass.
FO300023500	They keep the ruins Super Mutant free so people like you can get to people like me in one piece.
FO300023501	Without them, we'd be knee-deep in Mutie shit.
FO300023502	I understand your fight, but I still need to find my Dad.
FO300023503	Sorry. I'm so used to talking to an audience that can't answer I just assume you want to hear my voice all the time.
FO300023504	We got one rule in the Good Fight, though. You want help, you gotta contribute!
FO300023505	I understand your fight, but I have other concerns of my own.
FO300023506	Sorry. I'm so used to talking to an audience that can't answer I just assume you want to hear my voice all the time.
FO300023507	So, you want to know where your dad is? Fair enough.
FO300023508	We got one rule in the Good Fight though. You want help, you gotta' contribute!
FO300023509	Words don't kill people. Guns do.
FO300023510	You're absolutely right, but words get more and more people to join the cause. Guns just create more casualties on your side.
FO300023511	But enough yarn spinning. Let's figure out your place in the Good Fight. Then maybe we can help you.
FO300023512	I'm amazed you're still alive.
FO300023513	Oh I have plenty of enemies that would love nothing more than to put a bullet between my eyes.
FO300023514	The only thing keeping that from happening is Sarah Lyons and the Brotherhood of Steel.
FO300023515	We've brokered a sweet deal. They keep me from taking a dirt nap, and I keep a strong roof over their head.
FO300023516	All right, I'm sorry.
FO300023517	That's okay. This world has a way of getting under your skin and wiping the smile from your face. Makes you bitter. But you gotta fight that!
FO300023518	Give me a break. Stop mouthing off and tell me what I need to know.
FO300023519	If I was your momma, I'd tan your hide for that kind of talk.
FO300023520	Since I'm not, all I'm going to do is say goodbye.
FO300023521	So you fight the Good Fight with your voice on Galaxy News Radio.
FO300023522	Well, holy shit! Aren't you a chip off the old block? You ARE as smart as your dad.
FO300023523	Since you know all about the cause, no need to explain the effect. Let's get you on your way.
FO300023524	Look, I need to find my Dad. I don't have time for this nonsense.
FO300023525	It's obvious you're narrow of focus and can't see the bigger picture.
FO300023526	We got one rule in the Good Fight, though. You want help, you gotta contribute!
FO300023527	Look, I have problems of my own. I don't have time for this nonsense.
FO300023528	Three Dog is many things, but one thing he isn't is a pushover.
FO300023529	It's obvious you're narrow of focus and can't see the bigger picture. Fine. I may have the answers you want.
FO300023530	We got one rule in the Good Fight though. You want help, you gotta' contribute!
FO300023531	So, what's this about the Good Fight?
FO300023532	Patience, patience. Three Dog is like a minstrel. Give him some time and your ear and he'll soothe the soul.
FO300023533	The truth goes out across the Capital Wasteland and with it, the word about the Good Fight.
FO300023534	So, people fight back.
FO300023535	They can't, not against those kinds of enemies. They just run away and hide or they stay and die. It just ain't right.
FO300023536	So that's where I enter the picture. I fight the Good Fight with GNR as my gun.
FO300023537	The sound of truth goes out across the Capital Wasteland. Hell, someone's got to counter that bullshit on the Enclave station.
FO300023538	You're going to have a "Good Fight" on your hands if you don't help me...
FO300023539	Hey now. There's no need for that kind of talk. I'm here to help, not to hurt.
FO300023540	Whatever you want. I'm just looking for my Dad.
FO300023541	Hey, not everyone's cut out for bigger and better things. Sometimes the smallest roles in the Good Fight are the most important.
FO300023542	Whatever you say. You have your problems, I have mine.
FO300023543	Hey, not everyone's cut out for bigger and better things. Sometimes the smallest roles in the Good Fight are the most important.
FO300023544	But enough of that. If it's your dad you seek, then I will abide.
FO300023545	The Good Fight? What's that all about?
FO300023546	Imagine a picture, okay? A picture of the Capital Wasteland. All that brick and rock. A whole lot of nothing, right?
FO300023547	There's people out there trying to just barely make it by from day to day. Fighting to stay alive and make something of what they got.
FO300023548	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
FO300023549	Why don't you just sit back and relax?
FO300023550	I'm not here to fight. At least, not you. Only fight I'm interested in is the Good Fight, and I wage that everyday on the airwaves.
FO300023551	What's with the flashy introduction?
FO300023552	Hey, when you're in the Good Fight, you gotta give it all you got and never ever hold back.
FO300023553	Always dazzle 'em, I always say. Always dazzle 'em and spread the word.
FO300023554	Let me ask you something else.
FO300023555	Okay. Go for it.
FO300023556	What's this book you're working on?
FO300023557	Well, it's a dangerous place out there in the Wastes, right? People could really use a compilation of good advice. Like a Wasteland Survival Guide!
FO300023558	For that, I need an assistant to test my theories. I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt because of a mistake. Nobody's ever happy when that happens.
FO300023559	I'm still working on that survival guide that I told you about. Great idea, but I need help to test some of the theories.
FO300023560	Oh, did you reconsider helping me out? Because that'd be super awesome!
FO300023561	Oh, sure. I mean, if you're going to be my assistant, it's in my best interest that you stay alive, right?
FO300023562	Besides, I guess the original owner isn't coming back to pick it up, so you're the closest thing to an inheritor. Here!
FO300023563	Can I have that Armored Vault Suit?
FO300023564	Never mind, you crazy old bastard.
FO300023565	I still can't hear you!
FO300023566	I said: Are you all right?
FO300023567	I don't know where the clinic is, they don't let us out of the pens, you know?
FO300023568	Oh? Him? No, I have no idea where he is.
FO300023569	Oh, I don't know. I don't wear a watch, they're pretty rare you know. Ask someone else.
FO300023570	Are you okay? You seem a little out of it.
FO300023571	What? You'll have to speak up!
FO300023572	What are you looking at?
FO300023573	I'm watching the patrols, what do you think I'm looking at?
FO300023574	They switch it up a little bit every day, but just a little. There has to be some sort of pattern to it, it's just a matter of watching and waiting.
FO300023575	I've brought some bloodpacks to contribute.
FO300023576	I can only offer my thanks. My people are getting accustomed to using these as a substitute for live prey.
FO300023577	As compensation for your effort, allow me to at least give you something in return.
FO300023578	Again, many thanks. Here is your compensation.
FO300023579	How are things going now?
FO300023580	I've learned a bit more from Vance and I've been allowed around Meresti. I really think you helped me make the right decision. Thanks!
FO300023581	Everyone around here is being nice to me despite what happened, so I guess it all turned out well. Thanks!
FO300023582	It's weird living in my parent's old house with them gone, but I'll make the best of it.
FO300023583	Everyone around here is being nice to me despite what happened, so I guess it all turned out well. Thanks!
FO300023584	Things are much better. We all don't have to stay inside our houses and we sleep much better at night.
FO300023585	It hasn't been this peaceful in Arefu for as long as I can remember.
FO300023586	The proposal you've brought us from Vance should also ensure our safety. I don't think I'll ever be able to repay you.
FO300023587	Things are much better. We all don't have to stay inside our houses and we sleep much better at night.
FO300023588	It hasn't been this peaceful in Arefu for as long as I can remember.
FO300023589	Very well, actually. Our truce with Arefu is coming to fruition. I've begun teaching my people to live off of the donated bloodpacks.
FO300023590	The transition has been difficult, but we will manage.
FO300023591	You've certainly done us a great service, and I can't thank you enough.
FO300023592	As well as can be expected. I've had a bit of trouble keeping my people away from Arefu, but a deal is a deal and I will adhere to it.
FO300023593	We stay away from them, they don't send anyone else after us. The perfect stalemate I suppose.
FO300023594	Ha! Figures a shithole like this would have a local Chem head.
FO300023595	A place like this is probably crawling with junkies, huh?
FO300023596	Megaton might not be Tenpenny Tower, but that doesn't make breaking patient-doctor confidentiality any more ethical, now does it?
FO300023597	So you've got someone in town with a drug habit?
FO300023598	I'm afraid that goes against patient-doctor confidentiality.
FO300023599	Great. Another junkie... In case you haven't noticed, this is a clinic, not a candy store. And I've got work to do.
FO300023600	FFER11EyebotTopic3
FO300023601	I wouldn't. From what I hear, you mess with their Eyebots and the Enclave comes looking for you.
FO300023602	I heard tell of a scavenger tried that up Canterbury way. They found his body a week later, scorched with plasma bolts.
FO300023603	FFER11EyebotTopic2
FO300023604	Hell if I know. Spying on us probably. Nice reception, though. Wish I had speakers like that on my radio.
FO300023605	Do you think they're watching us through it? "Hi President Eden!" Maybe he'll come down for a visit sometime, ha ha ha.
FO300023606	I don't know, but I'd stay away from it. No telling what those Enclave types will get up to next.
FO300023607	FFER11EyebotTopic1
FO300023608	Creepy, if you ask me. What's it doing out here?
FO300023609	Yeah. Something kind of soothing about it though.
FO300023610	Me neither. I like the music, though. Kind of nice to hear something more cheerful than what those hippies on GNR always play.
FO300023611	Finding a crew might be tough. Good luck, though.
FO300023612	Let's talk about something else.
FO300023613	Whatever, kid. Whatever.
FO300023614	You don't look like you belong here. What's your story?
FO300023615	There ain't much to tell. I used to live out in the Wastes. I was a real bastard back then. But I've put all that behind me.
FO300023616	MS11FinBurkeThreatenPlayer
FO300023617	You've made a grievous error in judgement. Watch your back.
FO300023618	You pervert! You disgust me! Just stay away from me!
FO300023619	What's wrong with being in the basement? What the hell is going on?
FO300023620	You KNOW what I'm talking about! You spend all that time down in the basement, and I never questioned it.
FO300023621	Janet, calm down! What are you talking about?
FO300023622	Did you think I wouldn't find out? What kind of a sicko are you?
FO300023623	What? What did I do?
FO300023624	Roger, you son of a bitch!
FO300023625	Don't you see? You've been used. You're a pawn. You deserve better.
FO300023626	And just what "better" is there for me? What would you have me do?
FO300023627	Where did they come from?
FO300023628	Does it really matter? They're here now, and they're available for purchase.
FO300023629	What are their names?
FO300023630	Names?
FO300023631	I think Forty has a few nicknames for them, but none of them are very polite.
FO300023632	That's all.
FO300023633	Okay, then let's talk business.
FO300023634	Can you tell me a bit more about them?
FO300023635	They're all in excellent physical condition, if that's what you're wondering.
FO300023636	A bit stubborn, perhaps. But that behavior can be altered over time.
FO300023637	What did you want to know?
FO300023638	The kids, I think. There are three of them, right?
FO300023639	A very good eye, my friend. Those little ones are good as a long-term investment. They have their other uses as well, I'm sure.
FO300023640	They are most definitely up for sale.
FO300023641	Yes, we've covered that. They're still available.
FO300023642	I'd like the three kids.
FO300023643	What kind of meat is that you're selling, anyway?
FO300023644	Ha ha ha. The very best kind. Try some, you've never tasted sweeter, I'll warrant.
FO300023645	You sound like some of the hard-liners. We all served together for years, but now some of the soldiers hate them as much as the Super Mutants.
FO300023646	Well, good riddance to them. If you waver in your oaths, you get punished.
FO300023647	That's the thing, really. Casdin's "technology first" sort of attitude is more traditional in the Brotherhood always used to operate, out West.
FO300023648	But somewhere along the way from there to here, Elder Lyons made sure we watched out for the people, not just the technology.
FO300023649	To some of us, that was noble. I guess to Casdin and his crew, it was just soft. I wish they could see some sort of middle ground.
FO300023650	If so many people agreed with him, maybe he has a good point.
FO300023651	Me, I just wish there was a way we could all agree that at least we're still on the same side. There are bigger problems out there, after all.
FO300023652	It sounds like it was quite a loss. Is there any way to reconcile them?
FO300023653	As much as some of our soldiers would like to see them shot for deserting, there's not much we can do. We're too busy with the Super Mutants.
FO300023654	Meanwhile, they're busy seeking out new technology and trying to get back in contact with the Brotherhood out West.
FO300023655	So our paths rarely cross, but it's never pretty when they do. I just hope things cool down before it gets worse.
FO300023656	What are you doing about them?
FO300023657	Has it been worth the cost in lives and resources to protect people like you from the Super Mutants?
FO300023658	You tell me. I suspect my daughter's squad helped save your life. And most of our recent recruits have come from those we've saved over the years.
FO300023659	It's cost us, but we've saved many lives and made the Capital Wasteland a place where people can live. Yes, I'd say that's been worth it.
FO300023660	Has your decision been worth it?
FO300023661	The soldiers rallied behind Paladin Casdin, who was one of Elder Lyons' original squad. They served together for over twenty years.
FO300023662	Casdin was well-respected, and every bit as loyal to the Brotherhood as Elder Lyons. He just disagreed with the interpretations of our oaths.
FO300023663	But when disagreements turned into fistfights, he left with the Outcasts. We lost more allies that day than we ever have to any battle.
FO300023664	Who were the exiles?
FO300023665	Even now, a year after they left, the wounds of their departure are still sore.
FO300023666	Others understand their decision. Sometimes I hear them wondering if they should have gone with them.
FO300023667	I can't blame them, but I stand by my decision. And I respect theirs.
FO300023668	How do your remaining soldiers feel about the Outcasts?
FO300023669	Where Elder Lyons has fought to protect the people of the Capital Wasteland, the Outcasts demanded we move on and leave them to their fates.
FO300023670	They insisted there was more important technology to be recovered in a scientific base in the ruins of Fort Independence, to the West.
FO300023671	As callous as their decision may be, it's more in line with our original mission. Elder Lyons is an inspiration to us, but to them he's a traitor.
FO300023672	What sort of disagreements did they have?
FO300023673	Only in a very broad sense. The Brotherhood's oaths are to protect humanity's progress, but not necessarily every human.
FO300023674	"After all," they say, "everyone knows how to make another human, but the secrets to making a P94 Plasma Rifle are all but lost."
FO300023675	I thought the protection of humanity was a part of the Brotherhood's oaths.
FO300023676	The Outcasts are a result of my greatest mistake. But a mistake I'm proud of, nonetheless.
FO300023677	When I came here, I realized for the first time that the Brotherhood's technology could truly save the survivors in this Wasteland.
FO300023678	I chose to help them, even if it meant putting the Brotherhood's interests at risk. Some of my soldiers called me a hero. Others called me a traitor.
FO300023679	The dissenters left my command, calling themselves Outcasts to mock me. I cannot fault their dedication, even if I find them lacking in compassion.
FO300023680	Can you tell me about the Outcasts?
FO300023681	We were cast out for our dedication to the Brotherhood's true goals. Lyons wanted to play hero to the locals, instead of doing his job.
FO300023682	We were proud to leave him, so we kept the name "Outcasts" and wear it with pride. A big "fuck you" to the old man.
FO300023683	He may have struck our names from the great Codex, but we'll be vindicated in the end, and our names will be restored.
FO300023684	Tell me more about the Outcasts.
FO300023685	It's a rather sad story, I'm afraid. Last year, some of our soldiers had grave disagreements with the decisions of Elder Lyons.
FO300023686	Disagreements spiraled out of control, and there was a schism in the ranks. The loyal soldiers practically threw out the dissenters.
FO300023687	Now they call themselves the Outcasts.
FO300023688	Tell me more about the Outcasts.
FO300023689	We've got power armor and big guns and we're the ones doing the talking right now.
FO300023690	Usually, that's all a person needs to know, and they stop asking questions. You going to stop asking questions, now?
FO300023691	Who are you people?
FO300023692	We collect technology, and most people want what we've collected.
FO300023693	Right now, we're pretty much stuck defending this Fort, but that won't be forever.
FO300023694	Once we regroup, we'll continue our work and keep moving back west.
FO300023695	Tell me about the Outcasts.
FO300023696	We call ourselves the Outcasts, and we collect technology to preserve it from tribals and idiot locals.
FO300023697	And before you ask, we were cast out from that company of zeroes who call themselves Lyons' Brotherhood of Steel.
FO300023698	Way we figure it, if traitors think we're too harsh in following orders, we're probably doing something right.
FO300023699	Who are you people?
FO300023700	I'd really don't want to go into it.
FO300023701	Go bug Scribe Bowditch. He could talk a dog off a meat truck.
FO300023702	Outcasts? Who are they?
FO300023703	You're damned right you will. Now, get.
FO300023704	I think I made a wrong turn somewhere. I'll be leaving now, sir.
FO300023705	Wrong answer, scum.
FO300023706	Shut up and get that fucking gun out of my face.
FO300023707	MS07OutcastGreeting1C
FO300023708	<grumble>
FO300023709	You've either got a death wish, or a pair of stones bigger than hand grenades.
FO300023710	Say, you seem to have some smarts in you, and with your sort of guts, maybe you can help us out. Interested in collecting technology for us?
FO300023711	You've got a laser. Technically, you'd be asking "with highly focused light."
FO300023712	<grumble>
FO300023713	You've either got a death wish, or the biggest pair of stones ever sported by a woman.
FO300023714	Say, you seem to have some smarts in you, and with your sort of guts, maybe you can help us out. Interested in collecting technology for us?
FO300023715	You've got a laser. Technically, you'd be asking "with highly focused light."
FO300023716	Then I think we'd have a problem. And you don't want to be a problem around here.
FO300023717	Protector Casdin, he says I got a real knack for solving problems.
FO300023718	How about I skip right to calling you "Coco"?
FO300023719	Yeah, the red would never go with all this brown. But if we remodel and still need a corpse, we'll call you, 'kay?
FO300023720	I'm Defender Anne Marie Morgan, with the Outcasts. Good to have someone else out here who can keep up.
FO300023721	I'd hate if my corpse ruined this lovely Wasteland. It'd clash with the drapes.
FO300023722	You haven't been with the Brotherhood for very long if you think we're your troops.
FO300023723	And since you're on our base, it looks like you won't be with them for very long, either.
FO300023724	I'm with the Brotherhood. I didn't expect to see troops so far out here.
FO300023725	You won't see it many other places, either. Our job is to make sure it stays out of the hands of raiders, tribals, and the other crazies out there.
FO300023726	We're called the Outcasts. I'm Protector Casdin, and I'm in charge of protecting this sort of technology from abuse and misuse.
FO300023727	Who are you guys? I've never seen equipment like that.
FO300023728	Pop had an encyclopedia. He was real proud of it.
FO300023729	I wonder if they ever wrote a sequel?
FO300023730	Rococo Rockfowl? How did you end up with a name like that?
FO300023731	Yeah, that's what they all say. Usually just before stepping on a landmine.
FO300023732	I'm Defender Anne Marie Morgan with the Outcasts. Steer clear of here, and you should be able to continue with that whole "not dying" plan.
FO300023733	Trust me, I don't plan to die anytime soon.
FO300023734	Well, pass through some other direction. Or else you'll be "passing on."
FO300023735	I don't mean any trouble. I'm just passing through.
FO300023736	Don't shoot at me or my friends, I think we'll get along just fine!
FO300023737	Good to meet you, Rock. I hope you're on my side.
FO300023738	Defender Anne Marie Morgan, with the Outcasts.
FO300023739	But all you need to know is that I've got a gun and a low tolerance for screwing around.
FO300023740	Thanks for the help. Who are you?
FO300023741	Okay, I'll see what I can do.
FO300023742	Gee, thanks. Don't work too hard, okay?
FO300023743	You were too young to remember, and I suppose James never spoke of me. Typical.
FO300023744	I am Doctor Madison Li. I worked with your parents many years ago. Now I run the Science Lab here in Rivet City.
FO300023745	It was all I had left. When your mother died, your father decided to leave with you. He abandoned our work. We had no choice but to do the same.
FO300023746	Where's my father? Tell me now!
FO300023747	Calm down, calm down!
FO300023748	What are you doing here? James said you were still in the Vault. Look, this is all terribly irrational.
FO300023749	Project Purity was our life. It was the only thing that mattered, and then he just gave up. He abandoned us, and we were forced to move on.
FO300023750	I've already told him that it's over. There's no going back. Project Purity was a failure, and he needs to move on.
FO300023751	You know my father? Have you seen him?
FO300023752	Well yes, of course I do. Don't you know who I am? I suppose James never told you. Typical.
FO300023753	I am Doctor Madison Li. I worked with your father many years ago. Your mother as well, in fact.
FO300023754	You'll have to forgive me. This has all been very stressful, what with your father suddenly showing up here after being gone for so long.
FO300023755	Let's talk about something else.
FO300023756	Sure thing, baby. What did you have on your mind?
FO300023757	Why is Moriarty so hard on him?
FO300023758	Well, the miserable bastard is hard on all of us. But Gob gets it the worst. I guess just because he's different, you know?
FO300023759	I don't want to sound shallow or anything, I mean, I'm a whore, my standards aren't exactly high.
FO300023760	But there are places even I won't go. Johnnies that are squishier than me are one of 'em.
FO300023761	Where did he come from?
FO300023762	He don't talk about it much but apparently, there's a whole city of Ghouls somewhere down in DC.
FO300023763	He's mentioned his mother a couple of times, but other than that, he won't really say.
FO300023764	So, what's it take to hire you?
FO300023765	It used to be that Colin decided that stuff. But, with him gone, I'm thinking about retiring. So, no new clients. Sorry.
FO300023766	It takes you renting a room. Sleep in it, or don't. I don't care. I get paid either way.
FO300023767	What were you saying about radio stations?
FO300023768	Huh? Oh, you mean why was Gob banging on that radio? Well, out there in the Wastes, there are two stations that broadcast.
FO300023769	There's the Enclave station. I don't know who they are, but I think it might just be some pre-war broadcast on a loop or something.
FO300023770	And there's Galaxy News Radio. It's run by a guy named Three Dog somewhere down in DC. But the signal went down a while ago.
FO300023771	What's the story with that Ghoul?
FO300023772	Who, Gob? Well, if you can get past how he looks, he's a sweetheart. Colin's awfully hard on him, though.
FO300023773	Hey, can I have some of that hooch?
FO300023774	Help yourself, clown shoes. Grab one from the liquor cabinet. I never trust anyone without a drink in their hand.
FO300023775	Of course I never trust one that does either! Ha, ha!
FO300023776	Sure. Didn't I already tell you to?
FO300023777	Can I have another drink?
FO300023778	Dukov has a key I need. Steal it for me.
FO300023779	You've got to do something for me first.
FO300023780	I can't live like this any more. You take me to Rivet City and I'll get your key.
FO300023781	DialogueTenpennyConv00
FO300023782	Everything's just fabulous!
FO300023783	What's the point? Besides, I hate all that cold metal touching my skin. It gives me the willies! So, I'll just stick with visiting when I get sick.
FO300023784	Fabulous! Can I sell you a pair of sport shoes? Maybe they'd help you catch your wife when she runs away from you!
FO300023785	And I've got a little number in my shop that should help push up those sagging girls of yours, darling.
FO300023786	What the hell are you talking about?!
FO300023787	Come on man. Quit it already! I'm not interested!
FO300023788	You're not very subtle, you know.
FO300023789	What?! Are you kidding? I'm too fabulous to settle down.
FO300023790	That's right. And the safety's off. Back off.
FO300023791	Same old shit. See something big and ugly moving in the distance. Shoot the hell out of it. Go an' check to make sure it's dead. Rinse and repeat.
FO300023792	I can assure you, Mr. Wellington, we're not just sunning ourselves out there all day. That's for damn sure!
FO300023793	Hah! I'm fine with the same old shit all the time. The day something "interesting" happens in the Wasteland, it's time to retire!
FO300023794	Everything is under control, Ms. Montenegro.
FO300023795	You're pressing your luck, Hawthorne.
FO300023796	I'll be sure to discuss it with them Mrs. Wellington.
FO300023797	Hello Ms. Lancaster.
FO300023798	I'm afraid not, Ms. Cheng.
FO300023799	Right. Sure thing, Anthony.
FO300023800	Everythings fine, Chief. Thanks for keeping us safe.
FO300023801	Surgery of any kind is always extremely dangerous. The risk of infection is great. A doctor should never cut open a patient unless it's necessary.
FO300023802	Yes. They are a fine addition. Now, if we can only get the residents to start eating them!
FO300023803	I'm worried about you, Mrs. Cheng. Come by the Wellness Center, I might have a pill or two that'll help you relax and cope with things.
FO300023804	Fine, thank you. You and your men patrolling makes everyone feel safe here. Thanks again.
FO300023805	Haha! Nothing you can pin on me, Chief! But shouldn't you be out killing things in the Wasteland  instead of pestering old harmless fogies like me?
FO300023806	My dear boy. You've got all the adventure you need, right here in these four walls. For starters, you can figure out how to make your wife happy.
FO300023807	It's a radio play, not a documentary.
FO300023808	Let's you and I stick to finding trouble to get into here, before we rush out in the Wasteland again; I'll take Gustavo over a Behemoth any day.
FO300023809	Now there's an interesting idea, Mrs. Cheng!
FO300023810	I wouldn't know. She's avoiding me lately.
FO300023811	No worries, Comrade.  Everyone else  has trouble making the meetings, too. When I get my computer working, I'll get you a copy of the minutes.
FO300023812	<Sigh.> I don't know what to do, Comrade. Every day I fix it, but it always breaks again.
FO300023813	I shouldn't. A good leader, leads by example. But thank you anyway.
FO300023814	Right, Susan. Whatever you say.
FO300023815	Oh. Okay, dear. Goodbye.
FO300023816	We all feel safe knowing you and your men have this place locked up tight. Thank you!
FO300023817	I don't scrounge for anything. I run a high class Boutique, doctor, as you know. However, I can check with my supplier about holodisks for you.
FO300023818	Thank you!
FO300023819	Don't worry about them. Just be yourself dear. You've had a hard life. You deserve some happiness. Hell, we all do.
FO300023820	What a question! I don't know. I supposed it is. But, it can't always be helped. We can't help who we fall in love with, can we?
FO300023821	Raiders? Again? Well, I'll have to make do. Thank you for the heads up, Chief. And thank your men for us. We are all grateful of your presence here.
FO300023822	Shoo! Away with you. Leave me alone!
FO300023823	It's okay, really. I prefer to stay busy.
FO300023824	Really? He orders that every day. I prefer making more creative dishes. Choose something else, I beg you!
FO300023825	A sophisticated lady like you slaving over the stove? Don't trouble yourself with that, dear. You kick back and enjoy. I'm here to cook for you.
FO300023826	Sure! I could always use another pair of hands in the kitchen.
FO300023827	Oh that? It was nothing. A one time indiscretion, I assure you. Won't happen again, ol' chap. Scouts honor and all that. Care for a drink?
FO300023828	What? Very funny old man! Well, I hear she's also running low on dried up old raisins, you cheeky bastard! Leave a gent to his drink already!
FO300023829	Indeed! I'll drink to that!
FO300023830	Amen. I'll drink to that sister. Cheers!
FO300023831	Why do you think I spend so much time getting smashed in the lounge?
FO300023832	Indeed, Mrs. Cheng. Indeed! Sometimes it helps wash away a lot more than just one day.
FO300023833	Thank you for looking into that situation for me. I'm embarrassed it turned out to be nothing. Well, one can never be too careful.
FO300023834	Why thank you, dear! How charming of you to say so. Perhaps you and I should start spending some time together? Eh? Ahahah.
FO300023835	It hasn't been that long since my last "check up." So you know EXACTLY how I'm feeling, doctor.
FO300023836	Nonsense Edgar! I always find your manners to be quite "up to the task." if you know what I mean! He he he he. See you later, MISTER Wellington.
FO300023837	Eww! Banish the thought, old man! Seriously though, if you're still around in a decade or two, I might take you up on the offer.
FO300023838	Why do I intimidate you so? You weren't intimated the other night! Aha! See you around, Don Juan.
FO300023839	Don't they all, dear? Don't they all!
FO300023840	What? Are you kidding me?! Mind your own damn business. I don't go turning lights on in your closet, do I? Jeez!
FO300023841	I'm just great, if you don't count the fact that I'm married to the biggest idiot on the planet!
FO300023842	If you mean day dreaming about killing Mr. Cheng and knocking a few back in the lounge, then yeah, I'm able to relax once in a while.
FO300023843	It breaks all the time! Does he take that as a sign to spend time with me? No. Stupid man! He spends hours retyping everything. He's such a loser!
FO300023844	What?!
FO300023845	Cheers.
FO300023846	I'd be happy to have you help sometime, Mrs. Cheng. Cooking can be very therapeutic.
FO300023847	I hate that stupid man.
FO300023848	Who you calling frumpy?! At least my ass isn't shaped like a pear.
FO300023849	DialogueTenpennyConv01
FO300023850	The usual, dear. And please, be sure to remember to measure the salt precisely. We don't a repeat of last weeks debacle.
FO300023851	Yes! But the key to being fabulous, is that it comes from within. What you wear is only half the equation. BELIEVE you ARE already fabulous!
FO300023852	Whatever, you old hag. I'm just swelling with fabulous.
FO300023853	Those things are so tacky. How about you swing by New Urban Apparel, and I fit you into a cute Sunday dress? You need to spruce up your look dear.
FO300023854	Of course! Shopping is wonderful therapy, isn't it? Better than any old pill Doc Banfield prescribes.
FO300023855	I'm sorry? What?!
FO300023856	Thank you for your concern, Doctor. But things've been tense is all, and my men are just blowing off steam. Don't worry. They'll be fine.
FO300023857	And I envy your retirement, Dashwood. Though it's true. There's something satisfying about bagging a Rad-Scorpian at 100 yards with a single shot.
FO300023858	Cheng. Damn it. Call me "Chief." Chief Gustavo! All that "comrade" nonsense is really getting on my nerves.
FO300023859	That's kind of you, Ms. Primrose. But it's better if they don't cozy up with the residents. Helps retain discipline and remind them why they're here.
FO300023860	I'm on duty. You alright Hawthorne? Don't want a repeat of that little stunt you pulled.
FO300023861	Ms. Lancaster.
FO300023862	I'd have to say that would be extremely unlikely, Mrs. Cheng.
FO300023863	I'm afraid the lab coat never goes out of style for me. But I appreciate your concern.
FO300023864	Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about. Though, it's been awhile since I've seen you. We should schedule a checkup soon.
FO300023865	Absolutely not. All Wasteland meat MUST be thoroughly cooked. Disease and parasites are killed by the heat. I'm surprised I have to tell you this.
FO300023866	Ahem. Yes. It has been too long since you've been properly examined.
FO300023867	Why? Has someone been poisoned?!
FO300023868	I know a little bit about technology. I've picked up a few tricks in my adventures. Why, what seems to be the problem?
FO300023869	Hawthorne. Go easy on those remaining brain cells, alright?
FO300023870	You should count yourself very lucky. I do. Most people die a horrible death out there in the Wastes. Excitement and danger often go hand in hand.
FO300023871	Well, Comrade. My computer keeps breaking, and I have to start over each day. Not to worry though. I've got it practically memorized by now!
FO300023872	Because, while it's true, some of us are better suited to lead the community, by calling you all comrades, I'm helping you not feel envy or sadness.
FO300023873	Um. Hi.
FO300023874	Antique shop? Really, Anthony, you need some new material! And I'm not just talking about your jokes either, darling. Those threads are atrocious!
FO300023875	Yeah, I pop a couple, then have a Martini. Does wonders. Thanks Doc.
FO300023876	Mr. Cheng. Shouldn't YOU know what your wife would like? Why don't you go find out what she wants, and I'll see about ordering it for you.
FO300023877	Let's just say it's high time for a glass of wine. Putting on a happy face for all my customers all the time can be a bit tiresome.
FO300023878	Yes, Mrs. Cheng. It's not easy though, is it?
FO300023879	Thank you for saying so, sir. It's always my great pleasure. If you'd ever like to try another dish, I have an extensive menu of delicacies.
FO300023880	Things are alright, I guess. I'm thinking I should stop by sometime and get some new clothes. I just can't seem to find the time.
FO300023881	Nonsense. I'm fine. I enjoy making food and keeping the residents happy. A vacation from this would only make me anxious.
FO300023882	Oh, I'm alright, I suppose. Though, apparently raiders have been attacking the caravans again. Missed a shipment. I'll just have to be be creative!
FO300023883	Thank you for saying so! It's always been my dream to own my own restaurant. Supplies have been running low, but it just makes me more creative!
FO300023884	Thank you. It's always my pleasure to serve you Mr. Cheng. If you'd like, I could prepare a special candle light dinner for you and Mrs. Cheng.
FO300023885	Yes, well. There've been shortages of certain things, so I've had to get creative. I hope everything is to your liking Ms. Montenegro.
FO300023886	Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Besides, if I didn't cook for all of you, you'd starve to death! Heaven knows none of you can fend for yourselves!
FO300023887	Why, yes. I believe so. Fairly happy, anyway. I really enjoy what I do. Cooking and preparing meals for the residents makes me happy.
FO300023888	What? Oh right. Hah! That's a good one, Daring. I'm fine really. I've been drinking since I was a toddler. I can hold my liquor. What's new with you?
FO300023889	My secret to what? Oh right. The ladies. Always start off with a few drinks to loosen up, then move onto the hard liquor to get the party rolling!
FO300023890	Indeed! And at the beginning of a long day! Though, I prefer the stiffer stuff myself. So how're you holding up these days? How's that shop of yours?
FO300023891	I wouldn't pay you so much to hang out with me if I thought you were ugly! I'm just kidding. Stop fishing for compliments. You know you're beautiful.
FO300023892	Just goes to show you: It's always darker on the other side of the fence.
FO300023893	EDGAR! I do believe you are trying to shake me off! The fire has finally died away, has it, Edgar? You fancy someone else these days, do you?
FO300023894	Why thank you Allistair love. Er, I mean: MISTER Tenpenny!
FO300023895	Doctor Banfield! Have you lost your appointment book? I thought we've made a regular appointment. A "house call" I do believe!
FO300023896	Yes Edgar dear, I'm quite fine. Thanks for asking! Maybe I'll "see you" around  later, then? When you get out for an "evening stroll," perhaps?
FO300023897	Whatever. I know your type, Daring. You want me all to yourself. Well, I'm not some trophy animal you can just bag and hang on your wall!
FO300023898	Don't be scared Irving, dear! I won't bite. Well, not unless you ask me to! Hahahaha!
FO300023899	Don't be silly, Michael. It's because you pay me to be nice to you!
FO300023900	Why? You haven't seen him have you?!
FO300023901	Ha! Well, doc. If you got a pill that will make my husband disappear, I'll gladly take it.
FO300023902	Yeah. He's so stupid! I don't actually need to sneak out. I just tell him to piss off, and then I leave. If he was smart, he'd try to stop me. Men!
FO300023903	Oh no! I'm not going to make it that easy for you. If you can't figure it out, then I'm not going to help you. Why are you so stupid?!
FO300023904	You mean other than the fact that he is an idiot? Or that he's always busy with stupid meetings, or writing stupid books, that NO ONE cares about?
FO300023905	No amount of drink is going to make my husband less stupid. But, it'll certainly help me forget about him, won't it.
FO300023906	I've never heard Dad talk about you. Why is that?
FO300023907	I'm quite sure I don't know. Why don't you ask him that?
FO300023908	My father's gone missing. Have you seen him?
FO300023909	He was here, yes. It was quite a shock to see him after so many years.
FO300023910	I'm afraid he's gone now.
FO300023911	Where can I find Ted Strayer?
FO300023912	Have you tried the common room?  That's where he sleeps.
FO300023913	He usually goes to the Muddy Rudder on Sundays. Beyond that, who knows.
FO300023914	Where is this old lab of yours?
FO300023915	It's in the old Jefferson Memorial building, northwest of here.
FO300023916	Please don't go after him. It was foolish of him to even think about going there alone.
FO300023917	I'm sorry. Could you please tell me where he's gone?
FO300023918	Your father insisted that we return to work on Project Purity. I tried telling him too much time has passed; there's no way it would work.
FO300023919	Predictably, he refused to listen to me. He says he can prove it will work, and headed off to the old lab.
FO300023920	I'm sorry. I don't know what else to tell you.
FO300023921	If he was here, then do you know where he went?
FO300023922	Yes, I do. I told him repeatedly that it's too late, that the project is too far gone to be revived.
FO300023923	He insisted he can just pick up where we left off 20 years ago, and said he could prove it to me.
FO300023924	So he headed off to the old lab. I advised against it, but he went anyway.
FO300023925	Screw the Vault. I'm not staying cooped up in there.
FO300023926	I see.
FO300023927	So you decided to leave one of the safest places in the Wasteland, even though it was in your best interest to stay. Sounds familiar.
FO300023928	Well I'm afraid your father is no longer here.
FO300023929	I left the Vault to look for him.
FO300023930	Did you? I was under the impression that's exactly the opposite of what he wanted for you.
FO300023931	Well, you won't find him here. He's come and gone already.
FO300023932	This isn't about me. This is about my father. Now where is he?
FO300023933	Your father is no longer here, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't use that tone with me.
FO300023934	I'd like to know a bit more about you.
FO300023935	I returned here to Rivet City, and established the lab you see before you now.
FO300023936	Is there any way you can help me out?
FO300023937	Look, I don't want to be harsh, but I have problems of my own.
FO300023938	I don't have the resources to support James' foolish endeavors, or your chasing after him. I'm sorry.
FO300023939	Can you tell me more about my parents?
FO300023940	What else do you want to know?
FO300023941	What do you want to know?
FO300023942	What is this lab? What are you doing here?
FO300023943	This is the Rivet City Science lab.
FO300023944	It's taken many long years to put together, but we've done well for ourselves.
FO300023945	Our work on portable fusion power and hydroponics are coming along quite nicely, if not quite according to schedule.
FO300023946	All right, then.
FO300023947	That's enough.
FO300023948	By all means. I'm always proud to talk of my Brotherhood.
FO300023949	Okay, I think I understand.
FO300023950	Okay. Anything else?
FO300023951	That's enough for now.
FO300023952	A real challenge? Every blessed hour of every blessed day.
FO300023953	Just because we have good equipment doesn't mean we're invincible. A tool is only as good as the craftsman who holds it.
FO300023954	And I've seen my share of friends lost. Between the fighting, the Outcasts, and the everyday tragedies, we've seen plenty of grief in these Wastes.
FO300023955	Has the Brotherhood ever faced a real challenge?
FO300023956	The Brotherhood came out here to recover technology from the eastern cities and bases. If Lyons won't do it, then we will.
FO300023957	And when we resume contact with the Western Elders, Lyons is going to be put in his place.
FO300023958	Even if that place is in front of a firing squad.
FO300023959	So what's your long-term plan for dealing with the Brotherhood?
FO300023960	It seems like whichever challenge we're facing is always the biggest one. Survival at first, then expansion, and now cohesion.
FO300023961	We've seen plenty of Wasteland freaks or would-be dictators. They're not too bad, at least we've faced that sort of thing before.
FO300023962	What's the biggest challenge the Brotherhood has ever faced?
FO300023963	Anyway, I don't know if the old man's going to die from them, but he sure as hell looks like he's going to drag his soldiers down with him.
FO300023964	But he's not wasting any of our time anymore, damnit.
FO300023965	By that analogy, you think Lyons will be killed by the Super Mutants?
FO300023966	You know what? Never mind.
FO300023967	Sheesh. Ignorant savages.
FO300023968	"Ahab Lyons"? And what's a whale?
FO300023969	Oh, he used to be as tough as the rest of us. Wasn't so long ago, we fought side-by-side to Scourge the Pitt.
FO300023970	But somewhere, he went soft. Stopped looking at the big picture, and started trying to save every tribal and illiterate community he found.
FO300023971	When he had us helping those savages instead of recovering tech that could help us all, that's when we objected and became Outcasts.
FO300023972	How did Lyons change the Brotherhood?
FO300023973	I like to think that I've still got some big achievements left in me, although some of my joints seem to disagree these days.
FO300023974	I'll tell you what the low-lights of my time have been though: every time I've been shot at. I'm a scribe, not a soldier!
FO300023975	What have been the highlights of your time with the Brotherhood?
FO300023976	Not hardly. We've got our mission, we'll stick with it, and to hell with Lyons and his soldier sycophants.
FO300023977	If they call us Outcasts for our dedication to duty, then we'll wear the title with pride!
FO300023978	And you just wait for when we get back in contact with the real Brotherhood out West. Lyons will have hell to pay.
FO300023979	So, you just figure you'll strike out on your own as Outcasts?
FO300023980	I mean the Brotherhood from out West, back around California. We knew what we were doing back there. We didn't waste time with delusions of heroism.
FO300023981	We were collecting still-glowing embers from the ashes of humanity, before civilization's fire died completely.
FO300023982	We didn't worry about saving individual communities. We worried about saving the progress of humanity itself.
FO300023983	What do you mean "the original Brotherhood?"
FO300023984	And all at the cost of throwing away the lives of soldiers for a mission they didn't sign on for.
FO300023985	They're not supposed to be saving a bunch of backwards locals from raiders, they're supposed to be saving mankind from a new dark age.
FO300023986	Well, some of mankind, anyway. The important parts, at least.
FO300023987	But they're heroes! They defend the Capital Wasteland!
FO300023988	I'm afraid the answer to that is a lot more nuanced than others might suggest.
FO300023989	Brotherhood members are sworn to acquire and protect technology of the past. But not everyone interprets these oaths in the same way.
FO300023990	Elder Lyons sees these duties as part of a larger dedication to protect the innocent. Some, like the Outcasts, disagree with these priorities.
FO300023991	What are the central beliefs of the Brotherhood?
FO300023992	Do you sell any specialty items?
FO300023993	Which one, the original Brotherhood out West, or the shit that Lyons turned it into out here?
FO300023994	How do you feel about the Brotherhood of Steel?
FO300023995	I used to like serving with them, I really did. But, you know, the technology has to come first.
FO300023996	Elder Lyons was nice and all, but we don't rescue technology by being nice.
FO300023997	He was wasting my time, and my Pop didn't raise me to have my time wasted. So when Casdin left to continue the mission, I followed.
FO300023998	How do you feel about the Brotherhood of Steel?
FO300023999	You mean, apart from the fact that they ditched their mission and went native?
FO300024000	Sure, I bet you don't mind them being cuddly with the locals, but when we came out here, we had a mission to do, damnit.
FO300024001	But now they're wasting their time protecting yahoos like you, while Ahab Lyons is off chasing his Super Mutant white whale.
FO300024002	What have you got against the Brotherhood?
FO300024003	Oh yes, I can. In fact, I suspect I could write several texts on the various details of the Brotherhood.
FO300024004	But I suspect you're in a hurry, so what particulars would you like to know?
FO300024005	Can you tell me more about the Brotherhood of Steel?
FO300024006	It is a rather discouraging subject, isn't it?
FO300024007	Enough about the Outcasts.
FO300024008	Yes, let's speak of other things.
FO300024009	That's enough about the Outcasts.
FO300024010	If my father is there. I need to go after him.
FO300024011	It's in the old Jefferson Memorial building northwest of here, along the river.
FO300024012	It's not a safe place, and I wouldn't recommend going alone. As I said, I told your father not to go.
FO300024013	I don't need a lecture. I just need to know where to go.
FO300024014	Fine. Suit yourself.
FO300024015	It's in the old Jefferson Memorial building northwest of here, along the river.
FO300024016	Then tell me where this lab is, so I can get going.
FO300024017	I'm going to tell you the same thing I told your father. Don't go.
FO300024018	Whatever's left there, it isn't worth it anymore. The project was abandoned. We gave up. There's no reason to go back.
FO300024019	I'm off to Vault 112 to search for anything of Braun's that might help me get this purifier up and running.
FO300024020	All I know is that it's west of someplace called Evergreen Mills, and it's well-hidden in some sort of garage, but I'll find it. I have to.
FO300024021	It's so close, but that's the story of Project Purity, isn't it? An eternity of "almost theres."
FO300024022	Let's see if Braun has the missing puzzle piece.
FO300024023	To be honest, the G.E.C.K. sounded like pure fantasy, even for someone of Braun's capabilities.
FO300024024	But not only was this thing a reality, it was actually distributed to several vaults, to be used after an atomic war.
FO300024025	Vault 101 was, sadly, not on that list.
FO300024026	I did some digging, and discovered Braun's name on the reservation list for a Vault 112.
FO300024027	If I could gain access to just a fraction of Braun's genius, Project Purity would become a reality.
FO300024028	Even in Vault 101, my work on Project Purity never really stopped.
FO300024029	It was a Vault-Tec facility, after all. The place was built with some of the most advanced technology this country had ever developed.
FO300024030	It was easy enough to hack his console, gain access to the restricted files. Most of it was garbage.
FO300024031	Propaganda, spy reports, just plain rambling bullshit, really.
FO300024032	I knew of Braun's work, of course.
FO300024033	He was a celebrity in his day, Vault-Tec's "Sorcerer Scientist," leaving his peers in awe of his technological wizardry.
FO300024034	I first learned of Braun's involvement in Vault-Tec's Societal Preservation Program, and his work on something called the G.E.C.K.
FO300024035	The Garden of Eden Creation Kit.
FO300024036	That is to say, she thinks I'm completely mad. How can I blame her?
FO300024037	She's got her own life, her own team, and is making real, tangible scientific progress.
FO300024038	And here I come again, the very paragon of failure and false promises.
FO300024039	But the reality is I need Madison, and whatever scientific team she may have assembled. I can't do this myself.
FO300024040	This is day two of my attempt to resurrect this project.
FO300024041	I've got one of the portable fusion generators up and running, but it's just enough to power the emergency lighting and a couple of other systems.
FO300024042	That will serve for now, but I'll need help powering up the mainframe. Time to visit Madison at Rivet City.
FO300024043	So here I am, back where it all began. Project Purity. God, we wanted to change the world. We really thought the "waters of life" could be a reality.
FO300024044	And that's why this is a momentous occasion. Because even after nineteen years, I still believe it.
FO300024045	Project Purity can and will be operational. This is just the beginning.
FO300024046	Well. Here we are again. Project Purity and me. It's been close to twenty years since my last entry.
FO300024047	Since I left all of this behind to make a life for my son.
FO300024048	We've spent that time in Vault 101, tucked away from the rest of the world.
FO300024049	It wasn't perfect, but it was safe, and that's all I could have hoped for.
FO300024050	Now, my son is a grown man. Handsome, intelligent, confident. Just like his old man. Hmph.
FO300024051	And as hard as it was to admit it, he doesn't need his daddy anymore.
FO300024052	Well. Here we are again. Project Purity and me. It's been close to twenty years since my last entry.
FO300024053	Since I left all of this behind to make a life for my daughter.
FO300024054	We've spent that time in Vault 101, tucked away from the rest of the world.
FO300024055	It wasn't perfect, but it was safe, and that's all I could have hoped for.
FO300024056	Now, my daughter is a grown woman. Beautiful, intelligent, confident. Just like her mother.
FO300024057	And as hard as it was to admit it, she doesn't need her daddy anymore.
FO300024058	It's time to go. The project was in trouble before, both internally and externally.
FO300024059	Progress has come to a halt, both because our re-calculations have gotten us nowhere, and because the mutant attacks occur several times a day.
FO300024060	I regret that it has come to this. I know that if I leave, our work may come to an end.
FO300024061	Madison has never been on the best of terms with the Brotherhood; aside from Scribe Rothchild, she'll tolerate none of them.
FO300024062	If she's the one dealing with them, who knows what will happen.
FO300024063	It breaks my heart to go, but I must put the needs of my child before my own.
FO300024064	I am at a loss. My beloved wife is gone. In her place is my son, small and helpless.
FO300024065	Especially an infant without his mother.
FO300024066	I am at a loss. My beloved wife is gone. In her place is my daughter, small and helpless.
FO300024067	Especially an infant without her mother.
FO300024068	The team has made plans to scale back our work once the baby is born.
FO300024069	We're also trying to compensate for the increase in mutant attacks; no one is really talking about the implications of it.
FO300024070	There are more of them than before. We know it, and the Brotherhood soldiers know it.
FO300024071	Our relationship with the Brotherhood is straining.
FO300024072	They're concerned by the lack of concrete results from the project, especially in light of the mutant attacks.
FO300024073	They haven't come out and said it, but we all know what's going on.
FO300024074	They're questioning whether their involvement in our project is worth the trouble it's causing them.
FO300024075	They lost two good men this week, with three more injured.
FO300024076	Well, there's no more mystery behind Catherine's health problems.
FO300024077	The news of her pregnancy has lifted the spirits of everyone here, and given us a renewed interest in making the purifier work.
FO300024078	We now have a future generation to provide for.
FO300024079	The latest tests show that our methods are horribly inefficient, but I think we're on the right track.
FO300024080	Catherine refuses to rest; she insists on spending all day in the lab. I've never seen her more driven.
FO300024081	She's determined to resolve the power problems before the baby is born. I've tried to reason with her, but it's no use.
FO300024082	We're back at work after a full week of delays. The Brotherhood soldiers were able to repair the sentry guns, much to my relief.
FO300024083	I know Madison isn't comfortable having them here, but there's no denying that we'd be lost without them.
FO300024084	We're still waiting on the full analysis of the last three small-scale purification tests.
FO300024085	Catherine hasn't been feeling well, and it's slowing down our research. I don't mind, but I can tell it's bothering some of the others.
FO300024086	Any help you can provide would be appreciated.
FO300024087	Well, all I can do is offer my repair services to you. I'm pretty good with fixing stuff.
FO300024088	That's usually because Brailee breaks everything thinking she's making a cake or something.
FO300024089	Ohhhh! I'm sorry, I'll have to bake another batch. Maybe some other time.
FO300024090	Why, yes. Let me give you one of my old fashioned chocolate chip cookies! Enjoy!
FO300024091	There are a few interesting places around here I've heard about. I don't know if they'll help you or not, but you're welcome to them.
FO300024092	I've been saving up stuff for emergencies in case things with Arefu got tremendously bad.
FO300024093	You're welcome to some of it if you like.
FO300024094	Sorry, the well's run dry.
FO300024095	Look, whatever's going on between the two of you is the least of my concerns right now.
FO300024096	Against my advice, your father returned to the old lab. He said he had some unfinished business to take care of.
FO300024097	Look, I'm not here to hurt anyone, I swear.
FO300024098	All I care about are two things. My life and my wife's life. Beyond that, I don't give two shits.
FO300024099	If you need something, speak your piece and go.
FO300024100	Evan King told me to check on you. Is everything okay?
FO300024101	We're great. Just peachy. I love sitting in my house with my thumb up my ass.
FO300024102	Tell Mr. King that sitting here all day isn't going to make us any safer. We need to take action!
FO300024103	Oh! He's such a dear! I must remember to make more of those preserves he loves so much.
FO300024104	Scared out of my mind. I'm glad he's checking on us, but until someone nips the problem in the bud, we may as well stay inside forever.
FO300024105	I have a message for the West family from their daughter.
FO300024106	I can't take that. You're just going to have to bring it back to Lucy or to Ian if you can find him.
FO300024107	I can't take that. You're just going to have to bring it to the Wests yourself.
FO300024108	The Family's been dealt with and you owe me big.
FO300024109	If I had two caps to rub together, I'd still give them to you. Afraid I'm as poor as a Brahmin herder though.
FO300024110	But goddamn am I glad you walked up that ramp and lent us a hand.
FO300024111	What about Ian? Did you find him?
FO300024112	If I had two caps to rub together, I'd still give them to you. Afraid I'm as poor as a Brahmin herder though.
FO300024113	Ian told me everything you did for him. Goddamn am I glad you walked up that ramp and lent us a hand!
FO300024114	Thanks again, kid. Consider yourself welcome back here anytime you're in this part of the Wastes.
FO300024115	Yeah, I took care of your problem.
FO300024116	I don't know how you did it, but goddamn am I glad you walked up that ramp and lent us a hand.
FO300024117	What about Ian? Did you find him?
FO300024118	I know, I talked to Ian and he told me everything you did.
FO300024119	I don't know how you did it, but goddamn am I glad you walked up that ramp and lent us a hand.
FO300024120	Thanks again, kid. Consider yourself welcome back here anytime you're in this part of the Wastes.
FO300024121	It's done, Evan. The Family will never bother Arefu again.
FO300024122	I don't know how you did it, but goddamn am I glad you walked up that ramp and lent us a hand.
FO300024123	What about Ian? Did you find him?
FO300024124	I know, I talked to Ian and he told me everything you did.
FO300024125	I don't know how you did it, but goddamn am I glad you walked up that ramp and lent us a hand.
FO300024126	Thanks again, kid. Consider yourself welcome back here anytime you're in this part of the Wastes.
FO300024127	Well, I have this letter for the West Family.
FO300024128	That's great, but I got bigger problems than being the town post office right now.
FO300024129	The shit's about to hit the fan in this cesspool, and I don't think I can stop them.
FO300024130	I don't have time for games, Vance.
FO300024131	That is where you are mistaken, my friend. Time is a commodity more abundant than any other in this world.
FO300024132	Perhaps from these Laws you can discover what we are. Return to me when you are ready.
FO300024133	DialogueTenpennyConv02
FO300024134	Yes well. I'm a visionary, that's true. But I'm also a creature of habit. I like my Iguana Bits sandwich just the way I always get it. Thank you.
FO300024135	Looks like someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I bet I could help you end up on the right side! Haha! Have good day, dear.
FO300024136	Fine. Keep wearing those rags. But when you're ready for fabulous, you come see me; I've got just the thing!
FO300024137	No. Can't say that I do.
FO300024138	Why, you old hag! You're just jealous. My fabulousity pains you, doesn't it? You can't help feel smaller standing before my greatness, can you dear?
FO300024139	You need to MAKE time, dear! You'll never be fabulous just moping around a kitchen all day. You need to relax, go out, get done up, have some fun!
FO300024140	And I thought I hated MY life!
FO300024141	Well, that's more than I had in mind. Maybe I'll just order a new labcoat instead.
FO300024142	Alright. They're your men. I just don't want to have to sew anything back on because one of your guys got a little carried away.
FO300024143	Fine. For now. I got my eye on you. If you seem to be getting exhausted, I'm prescribing that vacation!
FO300024144	Ah! I remember now. Yes of course. I'll be sure to bring my medicine bag with me.
FO300024145	No. I'm afraid you'll need to take care of that one on your own. But I might have something that'll help you cope. Come see me for a prescription.
FO300024146	Yes, well. You'll think of something I'm sure. Good luck.
FO300024147	Hehe. I'm sorry to hear that, Irving. Maybe I should take a look at your computer sometime. Heheh.
FO300024148	That's the spirit, girl! Every seeming setback is actually just a chance for your genius to shine!
FO300024149	Just trying to keep busy, I guess. I'm not sure I'm really cut out for the whole retirement thing. Just can't seem to sit still.
FO300024150	We'll just have to see about that! You watch out! I can be a very stealthy hunter!
FO300024151	Some men just don't have the hunting instinct, dear. You should try talking to him about your needs.
FO300024152	Right, comrade! I see. The fabulous comes from the inside out. I will have to remember that. Thank you!
FO300024153	Every day it erases everything. Each day I have to start over again. But it's not the end of the world. I have everything memorized. Never mind.
FO300024154	Yes, you are right, comrade. But I'm afraid I've done something to upset her, and now she isn't talking to me. Never mind. I'll figure something out.
FO300024155	That's an excellent idea, comrade! I have to get her to stop and listen to me for a moment to even ask her if she'd like that. But thank you though.
FO300024156	Oh, I see. Well, maybe you're right. Mrs. Cheng spends a lot of time drinking in the lounge, doesn't she.
FO300024157	I don't know why I'm so stupid. Never mind. I'll go work on my projects.
FO300024158	Do you realize how often you use that word? You be careful, darling, or you'll wear it out like you've worn out your sense of style.
FO300024159	Right. Until next time, then.
FO300024160	Yes, of course, child! Your dishes are always superb!
FO300024161	Have you tried distracting him, dear? You know, get his "attention" every now and then? Some men are just clueless when it comes to a woman's needs.
FO300024162	Of course Mister Tenpenny.
FO300024163	Thank you, but I'm always so busy serving everyone. Maybe you can just pick something out for me and send it along with the hairnets.
FO300024164	Right, of course. Well, maybe I'll send a special desert over there today, to let them know we appreciate their keeping us safe and sound.
FO300024165	Indeed! I'll drink to that! Cheers!
FO300024166	Nah! Drown the buggars!
FO300024167	I always have my happy face on! I mean, just look at it! Are you looking? See how happy it is! The key, you see, is not to give a damn about anything
FO300024168	Oh, I see.
FO300024169	That's the spirit!
FO300024170	I just thought it might be helpful for the security team to know where everyone is and what they are doing. You know, in case of emergency.
FO300024171	Hehe. Of course, love. Until then. Be good boy now! Hahaha.
FO300024172	Call me Susan. And if you like, we can be on even more "familiar" terms! Hahah!
FO300024173	A house call, perhaps? I'll be waiting! Hahah!
FO300024174	Hehehehehe. Oh, Edgar.
FO300024175	That wife of yours has you terrified, doesn't she? Don't worry. I can help you relax.
FO300024176	Haha. Perhap's you're right, dear. But you could always set out a few meals in advance and take a nap once in a while.
FO300024177	I'm not sure whether to be hurt or flattered by all that.
FO300024178	I suppose it is.
FO300024179	I was afraid you'd say that.
FO300024180	Not yet.
FO300024181	I shouldn't have to talk to him. Why make it easy for him? He doesn't make it easy for me! If he can't see the problem, then he's just stupid.
FO300024182	That's because men are stupid.
FO300024183	I guess maybe I should figure out what I want to do with MY life.
FO300024184	I guess so.
FO300024185	Can you teach me the ways of the Vampire?
FO300024186	To be a vampire is a life commitment. It is not achieved by my words, it is something you earn by your own will and sincere meditation.
FO300024187	Sadly, I cannot fully make you one of us, but I can teach you how the life blood of others brings us regenerative powers.
FO300024188	Since your body lacks the way to extract blood as we do, you must find alternative sources for your nourishment.
FO300024189	Drink deep of the blood, allow not a drop to spill. Feel the warmth as it spreads inside you.
FO300024190	You are becoming one with the life force of another. They lend a part of themselves to you. For a brief moment, you are two entities becoming one.
FO300024191	Once you have done this deed, only then will you know what it is like to be a vampire.
FO300024192	There is no more I can teach you.
FO300024193	Use what little I have given you well, and carry that knowledge with honor.
FO300024194	Vance said others of our kind would find us! Sorry I was so harsh, but I don't share our leader's ability to feel others of our kind.
FO300024195	If I were you, I'd speak to Vance before you poke around too much. You can usually find him on the mezzanine overlooking the common area.
FO300024196	Reflect upon all I have said, my America. Reflect and wait. For soon this great nation will be reborn, and the Enclave will be its salvation.
FO300024197	And now, dearest America, we must say farewell. For there is much work to be done, and the Enclave never rests. Never.
FO300024198	But for now, my America, we must part. Restoring the greatest country in the world to its former glory, well. That takes time, even for the Enclave.
FO300024199	So remember, America. The Enclave is working around the clock to return this country to greatness. All you need is a little patience, a little faith.
FO300024200	We've got to part now, you and I, but don't be sad, America. The Enclave is working tirelessly to rebuild this great nation, so you don't have to.
FO300024201	Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.
FO300024202	Discipline is the soul of an army. It makes small numbers formidable; procures success to the weak, and esteem to all.
FO300024203	Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company.
FO300024204	Arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused to licentiousness.
FO300024205	Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?
FO300024206	Avoid popularity if you would have peace.
FO300024207	Everybody likes a compliment.
FO300024208	America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.
FO300024209	Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.
FO300024210	We can afford all that we need; but we can not afford all that we want.
FO300024211	This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.
FO300024212	A good leader can't get too far ahead of his followers.
FO300024213	The people under our system, like the king in a monarchy, never dies.
FO300024214	It is easier to do a job right than to explain why you didn't.
FO300024215	No evil can result from its inhibition more pernicious than its toleration.

FO300024229	The Brotherhood of Steel will fail! All those who oppose the Enclave will fail!
FO300024230	Let them come! Wave upon traitorous wave will crash against the Enclave's walls!
FO300024231	It is only a matter of time before the traitors march on the purifier, and attempt to take it by force.
FO300024232	The Brotherhood of Steel, in their arrogance, has claimed Project Purity as their own! They would steal the Enclave's work, steal America's water!
FO300024233	Even as I speak these words, fearless Enclave soldiers are fortifying their positions at the great water purifier, bracing for an inevitable assault.
FO300024234	Our great nation once more threatens to crumble, to topple into the sea of lawlessness and despair that have ruled us all for over 200 years.
FO300024235	Together, we'll restore the glory of this great nation. One problem at a time.
FO300024236	Very good, Colonel. Very good! So there you have it, my darling America. Enclave troops are now in your neighborhoods, in your lives, in your hearts.
FO300024237	Just stay out of the way and let us do our job. Interfere with the Enclave's mission, and you will be dealt with. Harshly.
FO300024238	When you see the Enclave, you see the United States government. We are authorized to restore order and civility, by any means necessary.
FO300024239	People of the Capital Wasteland. I am Colonel Autumn. By now, you have encountered Enclave troops in your towns, in your settlements.
FO300024240	Thank you, Mr. President.
FO300024241	But let's hear from the man himself, shall we? America, I give you - Colonel Augustus Autumn!
FO300024242	These fine men and women, under the command of the stalwart Colonel Augustus Autumn, have one mission: the restoration of American peace and order.
FO300024243	The Enclave is back, America! And no, not just on your radio. Right now Enclave troops are patrolling the Capital Wasteland!
FO300024244	Music placeholder.
FO300024245	So celebrate! Sing out! America is back! America IS beautiful!
FO300024246	Just a little bit more time. That's all we need until the purifier is ready for continual operation. And then, your thirst will truly be quenched!
FO300024247	For years, Enclave scientists have been hard at work on the most ambitious scientific endeavor the world has ever seen! Project Purity!
FO300024248	Well I'm going to tell you, right here, right now, those days are at an end! The Enclave is back, America, and we've brought clean water with us!
FO300024249	But that's not really living, is it? You're simply existing, America. Postponing death for a day or two.
FO300024250	Maybe you've got a makeshift purifier that cleans one glass of dirty water a day. Or you sip from an ancient faucet in an abandoned subway restroom.
FO300024251	Water is the foundation of life. But here in the Capital Wasteland, indeed in the entire country, water is polluted. Irradiated. Deadly.
FO300024252	You're thirsty, aren't you America? Not for knowledge or power, no. I'm not speaking metaphorically. You're thirsty for clean, fresh water. Hmm?
FO300024253	RadioEnclaveSpeech6A
FO300024254	But only together, TOGETHER, can we hope to reach our full potential. The way we were before the war. Whole. Beautiful. Powerful.
FO300024255	So, as your President, I am the voice, I am the heart and soul, of the Enclave. That is to say, I am the voice, heart, and soul... of America.
FO300024256	Just who is the Enclave? Why, that's simple. The Enclave is you, America. The Enclave is your sister, your aunt, your friend, your neighbor.
FO300024257	RadioEnclaveSpeech5A
FO300024258	We will rebuild the American family, as it was, as it was meant to be!
FO300024259	We will match up the destitute, orphaned children of the Capital Wasteland with qualified, eligible adults.
FO300024260	The Enclave will restore every American school, reinstate every youth program, and offer counseling and financial assistance to any family in need.
FO300024261	That changes! Right here! Right now! From this moment onward, the children of this great nation are its highest priority!
FO300024262	We both know the answer, don't we? None. America's children live a terrifying, meaningless existence. There is no hope. No happiness.
FO300024263	So let me ask you, America. How many of your children can say the same?  How many of this nation's youth are truly happy, truly carefree?
FO300024264	It was, for a little boy, the perfect existence.
FO300024265	Oh, the adventures we had! From Knob Creek to Hodgenville we roamed, carefree and courageous, irresponsible and completely inseparable.
FO300024266	When I was a child, growing up in rural Kentucky, I had the best friend a boy could hope for -- my dear old dog, Honey.
FO300024267	The Enclave will restore peace, order, and prosperity to this great nation. And those who oppose us will be… removed. Forever.
FO300024268	Lawlessness, terror, murder. They're all around us, I know. I know. But not for long, sweet America. Not for long. Oh no.
FO300024269	And last but not least, the hideously mutated Super Mutants that have completely overrun the entire downtown D.C. area.
FO300024270	What about the Slavers of Paradise falls? The frighteningly irradiated ghouls of Underworld?
FO300024271	And don't be fooled, America. Those who have left the Brotherhood of Steel, branded Outcasts, are just as dangerous. Even more so, being in exile.
FO300024272	Criminals who have had the audacity to claim this country's most important military installation, the Pentagon, as their own personal clubhouse!
FO300024273	These power-armored boy scouts are nothing more than common criminals with access to some antiquated technology.
FO300024274	The so-called "Brotherhood of Steel." Don't be fooled by their pseudo-knightly nonsense or supposed connections to the United States Army.
FO300024275	There are, of course, the Raiders. Those anarchistic ruffians who roam the wastes, preying on any an all, stealing, murdering. Beasts.
FO300024276	Let's take a tally of these agitators, shall we?
FO300024277	These radical malcontents don't care about you. They don't care about America. All they care about is fulfilling their own selfish desires.
FO300024278	Did you know, there are those amongst us who would shatter our hopes for peace, order, and security?
FO300024279	And that person will have our full faith and confidence, and carry our collective values forward, into the future.
FO300024280	Of course, when the time comes, when my term is up, America will be free to elect a new President.
FO300024281	But rest assured, I am your President because the appropriate people of this great nation decided I should be! I AM your duly elected representative.
FO300024282	Unfortunately, in the interest of national security, I'm not at liberty to discuss the details of the election. You understand.
FO300024283	To that I must answer of course! Of course I was elected, sweet America! Isn't the right to vote the very foundation of a democracy?
FO300024284	Or, whether or not I had been elected at all!
FO300024285	The question has been raised, I know, as to just how I came to be elected to this most illustrious office.
FO300024286	It's time we discussed something rather important. The issue at hand is, well, my presidency.
FO300024287	Of course you do. As President of the United States, you have my solemn pledge that I will never rest, NEVER rest, until we all have what we deserve.
FO300024288	Don't you, my darling America, deserve that? Don't you deserve a future free of war, and fear, and terrible uncertainty?
FO300024289	Rest assured, I will not make the mistakes of my predecessors. When John Henry Eden builds a country, he builds it to last. The American way.
FO300024290	Our intrepid leaders had everything they wanted. Power. Wealth. Prestige. And it made them lazy, America. Oh yes. And laziness breeds stupidity.
FO300024291	The answer is really quite simple. Incompetence. Incompetence at the highest echelons of power. We put our trust, our faith, in halfwits.
FO300024292	Indeed, the very seat of the federal government, Washington D.C., has been reduced to what is now known as the "Capital Wasteland."
FO300024293	Put your faith in John Henry Eden, great America, and baseball will live again!
FO300024294	What if they could compete with baseball teams, from Pennsylvania, or Maryland?
FO300024295	Now ask yourself this. What if the Capital Congressmen could live again?
FO300024296	If only for an afternoon.
FO300024297	Their name? The Capital Congressmen. Their purpose? To make you, dear America, revel in the joy of sport and sunshine.
FO300024298	And on the horizon, they appear, like knights of yore, armed with bats of ash and hickory.
FO300024299	Imagine, a perfect, cloudless day. The sun is warm, welcoming.
FO300024300	That's right, America. Before we were devastated by atomic war, each state had its OWN professional baseball team.
FO300024301	I've been thinking quite a bit lately about something we can all relate to, something that is unquestionably, inescapably… American.
FO300024302	This is President Eden, and you're listening to Enclave Radio -- the Voice of America.
FO300024303	I'm President John Henry Eden and you're listening to Enclave Radio -- the voice of warmth and reason in this cold, unreasonable world.
FO300024304	Hello, my beautiful America. This is President Eden, and it's time we had a talk.
FO300024305	Hello again, America the magnificent. This is President Eden, and I was hoping we could talk.
FO300024306	Sweet America. Hello again. This is President Eden, and I'd like to have a chat.
FO300024307	Greetings, dearest America. This is your President, John Henry Eden. Let's chat, shall we?
FO300024308	Greetings again, sweet America. This is President John Henry Eden, and I'd like to chat, if you've got a moment.
FO300024309	Hello again, America. This is John Henry Eden, your President. There are some things we should talk about, if that's all right.
FO300024310	And now, one of my inspirational quotes. From the mouth of your President, John Henry Eden, straight to your heart.
FO300024311	Tell me how I can get you out of that room.
FO300024312	At the end of the hallway to your right is a maintenance room.
FO300024313	Inside, you'll find the fire control console for the medical area. Trip the alarm on it, and I'll be able to get out.
FO300024314	A word of warning though. Tripping the console activates a failsafe and will open ALL of the recovery rooms in the medical area.
FO300024315	Remind me how to get you out of that room.
FO300024316	At the end of the hallway to your right is a maintenance room.
FO300024317	Inside, you'll find the fire control console for the medical area. Trip the alarm on it, and I'll be able to get out.
FO300024318	A word of warning though. Tripping the console activates a failsafe and will open ALL of the recovery rooms in the medical area.
FO300024319	How do you know the layout of this place?
FO300024320	I wish I could remember more, but I'm afraid it's all a blur.
FO300024321	As for the G.E.C.K., it's always rested where it does now. The foolish Super Mutants don't even know what they have.
FO300024322	Let's continue on now.
FO300024323	Very well.
FO300024324	Do you remember who you were?
FO300024325	I don't remember enough to tell you everything about my former self. My metamorphosis destroyed a good deal of my long term memory.
FO300024326	However, I can recall being in this place when it wasn't the macabre laboratory that it's become.
FO300024327	I remember walking around this place and seeing other humans in white lab coats and blue jumpsuits.
FO300024328	I wish I could find out more, but the personnel information for the Vault wasn't in the mainframe for some reason.
FO300024329	How did you become so articulate?
FO300024330	The terminal in my cell used to connect with Vault 87's mainframe. That gave me access to the history, literature, science and fiction book files.
FO300024331	I used this extensive database of works to better myself and my understanding of everything around me.
FO300024332	It was only recently the others caught me using the terminal and destroyed it to torment me.
FO300024333	So, you've been stuck in that cell ever since?
FO300024334	Yes. I've never been anywhere else. I used to mark the passage of time, but after a few years, it didn't seem to matter anymore.
FO300024335	The only thing that prevented me from going insane was the working access point to the Vault Mainframe in my makeshift cell.
FO300024336	So, tell me more about yourself.
FO300024337	I was born here, in this place. I don't mean that in the literal sense of course.
FO300024338	All I can remember is the excruciating pain that tore through me as my body underwent the rapid physical changes.
FO300024339	For most, this moment is what severs the grip on their minds. They become barely a shell of their former selves.
FO300024340	I was different. When I spoke to them, they immediately branded me "another failure" and had me placed here as a curiosity.
FO300024341	What else can I tell you about myself?
FO300024342	You obviously know all about the G.E.C.K., so let's help each other out.
FO300024343	Indeed. Your powers of deduction are quite impressive. I do indeed know where it is and how to get it.
FO300024344	The device is surrounded by a lethal field of radiation; lethal to humans that is.
FO300024345	Without insulting your intelligence, I think you can see where this is going.
FO300024346	I am indeed, but I have no time to discuss these matters.
FO300024347	Yes, you do appear a bit harried and you obviously didn't come into the depths of this place to chat with me.
FO300024348	I'd imagine the only reason you'd risk life and limb would be to retrieve the G.E.C.K. from its resting place.
FO300024349	How ironic that the others consider you a mutant of their kind.
FO300024350	Yes, indeed it is ironic.
FO300024351	Forgive my astonishment, but I hadn't expected to meet someone with such a learned outlook of these things. It is a pleasant change.
FO300024352	I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, it was only a matter of time before someone like you showed up for the G.E.C.K.
FO300024353	He doesn't live here. He came here to see Doctor Li.
FO300024354	Doctor Li, eh?
FO300024355	Well then I guess you'd have to ask Doctor Li for more information.
FO300024356	Go on up, then. She's probably in the Science Lab. But keep your nose clean, you hear me?
FO300024357	Forget it. I'm out of here.
FO300024358	Thanks for visiting Rivet City. Don't feel compelled to stop by again anytime soon.
FO300024359	I don't answer to you, pal.
FO300024360	On this boat, you sure as hell do. You don't get on without my say-so.
FO300024361	So I'll ask you again: what are you doing here?
FO300024362	Oh, I'm just wandering around.
FO300024363	Is that so?
FO300024364	All right, you're free to roam around, so long as you don't do anything stupid like try to slit my throat when I'm sleeping.
FO300024365	You wouldn't try anything stupid like that, now would you?
FO300024366	I'm looking for a Doctor Li.
FO300024367	Yeah? Let me guess -- no, she's not expecting you, but it's really important and you need to see her right away.
FO300024368	Been a lot of that going around lately, and I've had just about enough of it. So you're going to have to do better than that.
FO300024369	I'm looking for my father.
FO300024370	And who might your father be? If he lives on this boat, I know him.
FO300024371	Why does it matter who he is? Just let me pass.
FO300024372	It matters because I don't let just anybody wander around on this boat. I'm responsible for these people.
FO300024373	So either you tell me what I want to know, or you don't get on. It's pretty damned simple.
FO300024374	I'm sure you don't know him. He's lived in a Vault his whole life.
FO300024375	Oh yeah? And I'm a fairy princess.
FO300024376	You keep up this smart-ass attitude, and you're gonna wind up floating face-down in the river.
FO300024377	Hey, it's no big deal. I just need to see her for a minute, and I'll be gone.
FO300024378	Fine. Just don't bother her. She's real busy, what with all her work.
FO300024379	She's up in the Science Lab.
FO300024380	It's personal, okay? I swear I won't cause any trouble.
FO300024381	Yeah, yeah. Fine. But I've got my eye on you. You hear me?
FO300024382	You step out of line while you're on my boat, and you and me are going to have words.
FO300024383	Now get out of here. The Doctor's up in her lab.
FO300024384	I have some questions about her recent work in hydroponics.
FO300024385	Err, what? I don't know much about her work.
FO300024386	You'll have to ask her about that, I guess. She's probably in the Science Lab.
FO300024387	Just keep out of trouble on my boat.
FO300024388	My father came to see her. I'm trying to find him.
FO300024389	Hmm. Older guy, in his fifties or so?
FO300024390	I remember him. He left already, but Doctor Li might know more.
FO300024391	All right, you can go on up. She'll be in the Science Lab. Just don't cause any trouble, or else you're going to answer to me.
FO300024392	His notes said something about Vault 112. Do you know where it is?
FO300024393	No, I don't. I'm sorry.
FO300024394	Is this something to do with Dr. Braun? He kept talking about it while he was here. I told him it was a lost cause.
FO300024395	The whole project is a lost cause. I wish he could see that. It's been too long. It's too late to go back.
FO300024396	His notes referenced someone named Dr. Braun. What can you tell me about him?
FO300024397	I can't tell you anything more than I told James. I know who Braun was, yes, but he lived before the war.
FO300024398	James kept talking about this Vault, 112 he said, and insisting we should go there. It's just madness.
FO300024399	He's not at the lab. He left to go find something called a G.E.C.K.
FO300024400	He's out of his mind. I told him, over and over, that there was no use trying to revive the project now. It's just too late.
FO300024401	If he's intent on tracking down Dr. Braun, he's probably gone off to that Vault.
FO300024402	I know my father came to see you. I need to know where he is right now.
FO300024403	Haven't you seen him?
FO300024404	I'm looking for my father. I know he was here.
FO300024405	He said he'd work alone if he had to, and went back to the lab. You haven't seen him?
FO300024406	I've heard my father's notes. Did he come back here?
FO300024407	This is all just too much to bear right now.

FO300024433	I hadn't noticed.
FO300024434	Mm-hmm.
FO300024435	Right-o.
FO300024436	What's the latest gossip?
FO300024437	Have you seen the way Mrs. Cheng avoids her husband all the time? Poor Mr. Cheng drew the short straw when he married her, didn't he?
FO300024438	That Susan Lancaster is a real snob. And the way she flirts with all the men! The woman's got no sense of shame! No sense at all, if you ask me.
FO300024439	I think Mr. Ling is asking for trouble by teasing all the male guards the way he does. What he needs to do is find a nice woman and settle down.
FO300024440	Have you seen the way Mr. Dashwood skulks about when no one is looking. He's up to something, I'm sure! But what on earth could he be doing?
FO300024441	Ms. Primrose works too hard, poor girl. How is she ever supposed to land a good husband if she's stuck in her kitchen all day?
FO300024442	Have you ever wondered why the only house call Doctor Banfield makes is to that Susan Lancaster's room? How positively shameful!
FO300024443	Why does Mr. Cheng insist on calling everyone "Comrade?" It's "Comrade this." And "'Comrade that." Do you suppose he was dropped often as a child?
FO300024444	Mr. Hawthorne sure has pickled himself, hasn't he? That man exists in a constant state of inebriation. I wonder what drives him to the bottle so.
FO300024445	That Mr. Burke is a shady character, isn't he? I've heard some positively awful things about him. But Tenpenny trusts him. So he can't be all bad.
FO300024446	Ms. Montenegro's quite full of herself, isn't she? Puffed up like a souffle, she is! Ha! That was a good one, wasn't it? I'm quite funny today!

FO300024462	All right, all right. Double it is. Just bring me those bottles, if I have to listen to Sierra ramble on any longer, I think I'll blow my brains out!
FO300024463	So, you gonna' do it or what?
FO300024464	Tell you what, handsome. Find me some Quantum and we'll make it a threesome.
FO300024465	Holy shit! Are you for real? Hell yeah!
FO300024466	I'm off to find you some Quantum then and I know right where to go.
FO300024467	Yoo-hoo! Anyone home?
FO300024468	Then the other one tried to like hit him all in his head with some club and Ronald was so cool how he dodged it and shot the guy in the face.
FO300024469	Oh. Sorry! I get carried away sometimes. There's no need to get fresh about it though.
FO300024470	What's the matter with you? Didn't your mom and dad ever teach you any manners?
FO300024471	Lady, you've got some issues.
FO300024472	Come on, Sierra. No secrets between friends!
FO300024473	Imagine the look on the target's face when they are burning alive in an effervescent explosion of cola and fruit flavors!
FO300024474	So, what do you say? Will you bring me the bottles?
FO300024475	Nope, I'm not telling! It's a really cool surprise though. You're gonna love it, I promise!
FO300024476	What's the secret prize?
FO300024477	Okay, enough with the addict routine. Tell me what you want already!
FO300024478	"You can't resist the taste that'll blow up in your face!" like Ronald always says. He thinks of the best Nuka-Cola jingles!
FO300024479	Anyway, for every bottle you bring me I'll pay you some caps. You know, for expenses.
FO300024480	But if you're super cool and find like enough bottles to fill my Nuka-Cola machine, 30 in all, I got a super secret cool prize for you!
FO300024481	EvergreenCampfireFight01
FO300024482	Look, asshole. I told you, I found it. It's mine. If you wanted it, you should have been faster on the draw.
FO300024483	Callcasdin
FO300024484	Protector Casdin, sir! We've got a local interested in the job!
FO300024485	MS07OutcastWork
FO300024486	Nope. Sorry. Protector Casdin says the locals around here are barely smarter than the Mole Rats.
FO300024487	But Morgan said we might have some work for an outsider. Talk with her, if you're really interested.
FO300024488	Can I join your group?
FO300024489	Nope. Sorry. Protector Casdin says the locals around here are barely smarter than the Mole Rats.
FO300024490	But Morgan said we might have some work for an outsider. Talk with her, if you're really interested.
FO300024491	Can I join your group?
FO300024492	We aren't recruiting, kid. Old sap Lyons might trust walk-ins, but we don't.
FO300024493	You bring in technological devices, and we'll pay you a finder's fee, based on the device. But Protector Casdin would have to okay it, first.
FO300024494	You collect technology? How do I sign up?
FO300024495	Are you interested in Lincoln's hat?
FO300024496	Such strange clothing. We may never truly understand Lincoln and his times.
FO300024497	It's worth 25 caps to me.
FO300024498	What a ridiculous hat. I'll pay you 25 caps for it.
FO300024499	I found one of Lincoln's old hats. Care to buy it?
FO300024500	Lincoln's actual hat? Amazing! I must have it for the museum!
FO300024501	How does 70 caps sound?
FO300024502	How much for this war poster?
FO300024503	Those damn abolitionists would use this against us. I'll give you 50 caps. You won't get a better price anywhere else.
FO300024504	The words of the great Lincoln, calling his people to war! I can spare 75 caps for it.
FO300024505	I've got this old war poster from Lincoln's Civil War. Want to buy it?
FO300024506	That would look fantastic on the museum wall! What do you say to 60 caps?
FO300024507	I have a collection of pennies with Lincoln's face on them.
FO300024508	Not exactly something that will rally slaves, eh? I'll give you 15 caps for it.
FO300024509	I suppose these have some small value to the faithful. I'll give you 15 caps for it.
FO300024510	Pennies, eh? That's the old money they used long ago.
FO300024511	Well, any artifact from American history would benefit the museum. How about 15 caps for the lot of them?
FO300024512	I found Lincoln's diary.
FO300024513	This is truly a dangerous book. I'll pay 75 caps for it.
FO300024514	The words of the great man himself? In his own handwriting? I'll pay 100 caps for it.
FO300024515	I have Lincoln's diary. I might be willing to sell it.
FO300024516	Oh my goodness! Hand written by one of the greatest presidents of our country?
FO300024517	The Society must possess this. I'll give you 100 caps for it!
FO300024518	I've got a wanted poster for Lincoln's assassin.
FO300024519	Nice! I'll give you 75 caps for it.
FO300024520	To think that even the great Lincoln was felled by an assassin. This is a reminder to all that we must remain vigilant.
FO300024521	I would like to buy it from you for 50 caps.
FO300024522	Interesting. I'd love to have that in the museum's collection.
FO300024523	I will buy it from you for 70 caps. What do you say?
FO300024524	What will you give me for this toy of Lincoln?
FO300024525	I suppose I could give you 10 caps. It's not very inspiring, is it?
FO300024526	It's a small thing, but I'll give you 10 caps for it.
FO300024527	Quite a nice specimen you have there. How about I give you 10 caps for it?
FO300024528	Then stop wasting my time and tell me where he is.
FO300024529	Well I don't know where he is. The last I knew, he was going back to the old lab.
FO300024530	Now will you kindly leave? I have work to do.
FO300024531	I'm looking for my father. Have you seen him?
FO300024532	I did see a man talking to Doctor Li, but I really shouldn't be discussing it.
FO300024533	She's already in a bad mood. I'd hate to make it worse.
FO300024534	You should probably just talk to her about it.
FO300024535	Look, some of us are trying to get work done here. There have been enough disruptions recently.
FO300024536	Anybody coming through here would have to talk to Doctor Li; why don't you go bother her about it?
FO300024537	Don't you judge me! It's not my fault that the only guys in this town are liars and jerks!
FO300024538	"Oh, you can't break up with me, we're all going to die soon!" Well, duh, why do you think I'm breaking up with you!
FO300024539	When I die, the last thing I want to worry about in my afterlife is breaking up with my once-alive boyfriend. Priorities!
FO300024540	Oh, man, don't even go there. You'd think a girl like that would be more, you know, "adventurous." But that's a dry well, my friend.
FO300024541	All she does is talk about how she hates everyone else or how dark her clothing is. A guy can only take so much of that before he snaps.
FO300024542	Poor Pappy got the worst of it. I swear, he's gotten even more depressed since she dumped him for me. As if being here wasn't bad enough.
FO300024543	I hear you and Bittercup were an item.
FO300024544	We did? Wow, that's news to me. How long was I unconscious, again?
FO300024545	Bittercup tells me the two of you had a thing together.
FO300024546	I told her things would be safe here. How was I supposed to know all those stories were bunk? Then she dumped me, called me a liar.
FO300024547	I was lied to myself, alright! Well, that didn't matter to her. Then she started dating Flash and got all spooky. Good riddance.
FO300024548	You came here with Bittercup, right?
FO300024549	Oh, that. I know all about that nonsense. Flash isn't the smartest cookie in the jar, but he deserved better than Bittercup.
FO300024550	She wouldn't be so bad if she just faced reality, instead of doing that whole "spooky girl" routine.
FO300024551	Did you know Flash used to date Bittercup?
FO300024552	Who lives here?
FO300024553	You mean Dusty? Never talks about himself much. Never talks about anything much.
FO300024554	We used to take turns, but Dusty started guarding the gate night and day. Little weird, but I'm not complaining.
FO300024555	Who's that guy guarding the gate?
FO300024556	Well, I mainly hang around Pappy. He's not such a bad guy. You should have seen him when he first got here, so bright and positive.
FO300024557	Who lives here, anyway?
FO300024558	Everyone's dead or dying. Now leave me alone.
FO300024559	You just think you can order people around, huh? You're like Flash. You think you're in charge, but you're not.
FO300024560	Kimba says we should get along, but we're all gonna just gonna end up like Timebomb: dying on a table in Red's clinic.
FO300024561	Red and Kimba won't talk to me, just because I used to date Pappy and Flash! They're so jealous!
FO300024562	Maybe that thing I had with Timebomb was wrong, but still! I don't need them! I'll do whatever I want!
FO300024563	You and the other people here don't seem to get along.
FO300024564	At least, that's kinda how things got settled. Everyone sort of picks their own work here, you know? No mayor or anything.
FO300024565	You live here, right? What do you know about the people?
FO300024566	Aw, that's no fun. I prefer my victims energetic and in agony.
FO300024567	Big talk, killer. Why don't you leave, and let me watch out for people less discriminating than yourself.
FO300024568	You've accepted death? Killing all of you should be easy, then.
FO300024569	We're under attack, again! Everyone get down!
FO300024570	I just need somewhere to trade my salvage.
FO300024571	There isn't anything here that hasn't been destroyed or dragged away. You're better off scavenging the dead out in the wasteland.
FO300024572	Paradise Falls? Where's that?
FO300024573	Nearby. Slavers move quick and come from all directions. Someone else might know where they nest.
FO300024574	Where do the Super Mutants come from?
FO300024575	Skulk up toward Germantown, near the police station. They always come from that direction.
FO300024576	I want a new opening speech. One that acknowledges me as King.
FO300024577	Don't think you'll scare anyone here. You could shoot down everyone in town, and I wouldn't flinch.
FO300024578	You live in Bigtown; you learn to accept death.
FO300024579	I want a new opening speech. One that acknowledges me as King.
FO300024580	Don't think you'll scare anyone here. You could shoot down everyone in town, and I wouldn't flinch.
FO300024581	You live in Bigtown; you learn to accept death.
FO300024582	I want a new opening speech. One that acknowledges me as Queen.
FO300024583	So, you're under constant threat?
FO300024584	There was a Super Mutant attack recently and where there's one big ugly, there are ten more just waiting to grab you by the throat.
FO300024585	Then the slavers will come and pick off what's left of your carcass, and drag any survivors to Paradise Falls.
FO300024586	What happened to our deal, Sierra?
FO300024587	He loves me! He really really loves me! Now I bet he'll ask me to get married.
FO300024588	Oh! For my wedding present I'm giving him the super secret prize too!
FO300024589	Whatever.
FO300024590	Okay, well don't forget I'll still buy bottles of Quantum from you!
FO300024591	You bitch! That was supposed to be for me!
FO300024592	You can't expect me to get married without a gift for my future husband do you? That wouldn't be right.
FO300024593	And don't call me names like that, it hurts my feelings.
FO300024594	Can't you see, Sierra? He just wants to sleep with you.
FO300024595	A sleepover? Awesome! We could tell bedtime stories and do each other's hair and all sorts of fun stuff.
FO300024596	I could even make some Nuka-Cola treats for when we get the munchies late at night. That would be fun!
FO300024597	Yep. I'll be seeing you, soon I hope.
FO300024598	Yep, they sure were hard to get, and you got 'em you big 'ole teddy bear! Anyway, gotta' get these into the machine. Seeya, sweetie!
FO300024599	He he. That's ok, Sierra. Play hard to get. I love it!
FO300024600	Some of what?
FO300024601	That's ok, baby. We have plenty of time. You know where to find me when you want some of this.
FO300024602	Well, maybe later. I have a lot of things to do now. Need to get all of this Quantum icy cold.
FO300024603	Nothing. So, you wanna' celebrate?
FO300024604	What was that?
FO300024605	Yeah, I'll fill your machine all right. Hehe.
FO300024606	Oh my goodness! You absolute dear! You found the Quantum to fill my machine!
FO300024607	Hi there, sweet cheeks. I got something for you.
FO300024608	Oh great. I thought I was rid of you.
FO300024609	No such luck, sucker! Life ain't worth living without Butch around, and you can't keep a Tunnel Snake down.
FO300024610	But if you're lucky, you can hold my empties. Here.
FO300024611	How did you get all the way down here?
FO300024612	Ah, you know you can't keep a Tunnel Snake cooped up forever! We gotta be free, and your little visit was just the inspiration I needed!
FO300024613	So here's to sweet, glorious freedom! Cheers!
FO300024614	I thought the Overseer closed the Vault. How did you get out?
FO300024615	Same way anyone does. By being too cool to stop anywhere else! I didn't see a thing in the wasteland that was a match for a bona fide Tunnel Snake!
FO300024616	So, here's to freedom and rocking the Wasteland! Drink up!
FO300024617	Sounds like a deal. Good to see you on the outside, Butch!
FO300024618	Here's to raising hell and living the good life out here! Cheers!
FO300024619	Now all we need is a gang, and we could take over this whole Wasteland!
FO300024620	Can I see what you have for sale?
FO300024621	If your caps are good, you can buy whatever you like. Beats standing there drooling all over the merchandise.
FO300024622	Drinking that stuff can't be good for you if it contains radiation.
FO300024623	Well, I guess so. I heard that sometimes the radiation would remain in people's systems, but only in a few test cases.
FO300024624	All you'd need is a little RadAway and poof, the isotope is gone.
FO300024625	What happens when you drink a Nuka-Cola Quantum?
FO300024626	Oh my! It's like a tidal wave of flavor washing all over your body!
FO300024627	Your head spins but everything is clear at the same time. It is quite a rush.
FO300024628	What exactly does a bottle of Quantum look like?
FO300024629	Well, the bottles are glass just like regular Nuka-Cola, except the glass is clear.
FO300024630	That way the glowy stuff inside shows through. You'll know it when you see it.
FO300024631	<Morse Code Clicking>
FO300024632	Could I become a Treeminder?
FO300024633	Although we would welcome you with open arms, you were obviously drawn here to help us.
FO300024634	What remains to be seen is what that help turns out to be.
FO300024635	Becoming a disciple of the Great One takes many years of dedication and the will to cast aside your reliance on technological conveniences.
FO300024636	However, I feel you've been sent here for a higher purpose and could be more instrumental in our future than a mere Treeminder.
FO300024637	How do the Treeminders normally handle other Outsiders?
FO300024638	Without His blessing, we would not allow an Outsider inside this vale.
FO300024639	If the Outsider doesn't have His blessing, we simply deny him entry to our home.
FO300024640	If they persist on trying to gain entry, or display any hostile act that could potentially harm the Great One, we take action.
FO300024641	If the Outsider were a Raider or some other nefarious type, we ensure they don't report our location back to their comrades.
FO300024642	How did the Treeminders begin?
FO300024643	I'm afraid I can take none of the credit for my husband's creation.
FO300024644	I arrived perhaps a year after him, well after he established the Treeminders.
FO300024645	When I first beheld the glory of the Great One, I knew there'd be others who would seek to do Him harm.
FO300024646	I also knew He would be calling others that he felt were pure of heart to protect Him.
FO300024647	I don't think Leaf Mother Laurel is going to like hearing you say that!
FO300024648	Go tell her what you want, my opinion is my own. That's one of the founding ideals of the Treeminders.
FO300024649	And being an Outsider, I'd expect you not to judge our laws!
FO300024650	What if all the Treeminders don't agree with you?
FO300024651	That would worry me. I was out there once like you. I wandered the Wasteland for many years.
FO300024652	All I saw was poverty, famine, sickness, hate and death everywhere I turned.
FO300024653	I think you're right. Who knows what would happen to this place?
FO300024654	Exactly! I was out there once like you. I wandered the Wasteland for many years.
FO300024655	All I saw was poverty, famine, sickness, hate and death everywhere I turned.
FO300024656	What did you have to do to become a Treeminder?
FO300024657	Actually, you already did some of it. I had to do the Ceremony and meet with the Great One.
FO300024658	Then Tree Father Birch taught me everything I needed to know about Oasis and how it has to remain a secret.
FO300024659	That's why I'm so worried. I just think letting this place spread into the Wasteland would be an unwise decision.
FO300024660	Like I said before, thanks to Tree Father Birch, I learned everything I needed to know about Oasis and how it has to remain a secret.
FO300024661	That's why I'm so worried. I just think letting this place spread into the Wasteland would be an unwise decision.
FO300024662	Remind me again what you did to become a Treeminder.
FO300024663	Just get born I guess. He he! You're funny!
FO300024664	I had to accept the ideals of Tree Father Birch and cast away my dependence on technology.
FO300024665	I sort of fell into it I guess. I woke up here and I just stayed. After a while, I became one of them.
FO300024666	I was the third one to arrive here in Oasis. Tree Father Birch was a bit wary at first, but Leaf Mother Laurel convinced him to let me stay.
FO300024667	If she hadn't been around, I doubt Birch would have let me stay here.
FO300024668	After a while, they taught me their ways and together we developed the Ceremony of Purification that you undertook.
FO300024669	Please, go right ahead.
FO300024670	May I ask you about the Treeminders?
FO300024671	Of course. We're quite open about everything here.
FO300024672	May I ask you about the Treeminders?
FO300024673	Did you know your god wants to die?
FO300024674	What?! How can you say something so awful and terrible?! Leave me alone, I never wanna talk to you again!
FO300024675	You speak heresy! Tree Father Birch should hear about this!
FO300024676	Heresy? Not at all. Leaf Mother Laurel's word is just as binding as Tree Father Birch's. I have no obligation to follow one or the other.
FO300024677	How dare you speak to a Bloomseer like that! I know our laws better than any Outsider would! Now begone!
FO300024678	What if there are other that don't share your opinion?
FO300024679	You'd think they'd realize that this place won't remain a secret forever. The caravans know about it and you happened upon it.
FO300024680	How long before someone comes to take this place by force? No, I say allow Oasis to grow and that issue becomes moot.
FO300024681	I agree completely!
FO300024682	Oh, if only Tree Father Birch saw it as you do! Of everyone, he's been here the longest.
FO300024683	You'd think he'd realize that this place won't remain a secret forever. The caravans know about it and you found it.
FO300024684	How long before someone comes to take this place by force? No, I say allow this place to grow and that issue becomes moot.
FO300024685	Yeah, well guess what? He's really a monster!
FO300024686	Hey! He's not a monster! You meanie! I never wanna talk to you again!
FO300024687	I can't believe a tree would be scared of anything.
FO300024688	Hey! He's not a tree! He's my friend! Don't be mean.
FO300024689	What's Harold scared of?
FO300024690	Sorry, that's only for secrets between friends!
FO300024691	Hey, maybe if you tell me what Harold is scared of I won't be scared either.
FO300024692	Awww, I never knew an Outsider could be scared of anything!
FO300024693	Harold told me that he's scared of fire. If fire ever got on him, it would burn him and Bob until they were all gone.
FO300024694	That's why we keep the fires far away from him.
FO300024695	Tell me about your "god."
FO300024696	Oh, you mean Harold? He's really nice. Sometimes when I get really lonely, I go into the Grove and talk to him.
FO300024697	Sometimes I even curl up all cozy like and sleep next to his roots after I have a bad dream.
FO300024698	I tell him what I'm scared of and he tells me what he's scared of. It makes me feel better knowing I'm not the only one.
FO300024699	Sometimes I even curl up all cozy like and sleep next to his roots after I have a bad dream.
FO300024700	I tell him what I'm scared of and he tells me what he's scared of. It makes me feel better knowing I'm not the only one.
FO300024701	Can you tell me about your "god" again? I'd forgotten what you said.
FO300024702	He is the Great One. The Tree Father of Tree Fathers. There is no greater being in the world than He.
FO300024703	I've dedicated my life to protecting this place from the outside world and I will never fail in that duty.
FO300024704	Being in His presence gives me the greatest sense of peace I've ever felt in my entire life.
FO300024705	Look around you, Outsider. This place wasn't built by man or made by a machine. This place is a miracle and only a god can perform a miracle.
FO300024706	He's not my god, He's everyone's god. You, me, everyone. This place isn't meant for just the Treeminders, it's for all mankind.
FO300024707	Like I said, He's everyone's god. This place isn't meant for just the Treeminders, it's for all mankind.
FO300024708	Can you tell me about your "god" again? I'd forgotten what you said.
FO300024709	Alright. I'll be careful. I promise.
FO300024710	You're welcome. Don't do anything strenuous for a few weeks.
FO300024711	Oh, yeah, sure. I understand. Here. That's all I have.
FO300024712	It wasn't free. Doctor's fees are expensive. Understand?
FO300024713	Oh, uh, okay. Whatever you say.
FO300024714	Nothing happened. I just need you to answer some questions.
FO300024715	Ah, shit.
FO300024716	I wanted you to be conscious before I killed you.
FO300024717	You had seven bullet wounds and broke both clavicles. Should be fine now.
FO300024718	You sound like you were in love with her.
FO300024719	Love? What are you talking about.
FO300024720	All I know is things are sure gonna be awfully quiet around here with her gone.
FO300024721	Ah well. I guess I'll go clean up the mess and take care of things around here.
FO300024722	I killed her. Got a problem with that, tough guy?
FO300024723	What?? You're crazy! How could you just go and kill her like that?!
FO300024724	Sorry, I don't know. (Lie)
FO300024725	Are you shittin' me? What a waste! Oh man.
FO300024726	Sierra is dead.
FO300024727	What? What the hell happened?
FO300024728	Is there anything else interesting to see near Girdershade?
FO300024729	Well, to the east there are some nasty Raiders in Evergreen Mills. I'd stay away from there if I were you.
FO300024730	Luckily, we're kind of hidden here under the old highway, so no one bothers us.
FO300024731	My friend, you are at the ass end of the Capital Wasteland. If it weren't for Sierra I'd be out of here.
FO300024732	One thing I can tell you is stay the hell away from the Dunwich Building to the south. That place is bad mojo.
FO300024733	I dunno what that place is about, but I hear about weird shit going on.
FO300024734	What can you tell me about Nuka-Cola Cocktails?
FO300024735	I don't know a whole lot about weapons, but I do know that it's more powerful than the Molotov Cocktail.
FO300024736	It explodes in a huge blue flame too! How cool is that?
FO300024737	Tell me more about the Nuka Grenade.
FO300024738	DialogueTenpennyConvShortGoodbye
FO300024739	Sorry. Can't talk now.
FO300024740	Good to see you!
FO300024741	Hello.
FO300024742	See you later.
FO300024743	No, not all right. Every day you don't help with this research is another day people might die!
FO300024744	And I can't write without good research, or else people might follow bad info and die anyway! So get to work!
FO300024745	I'll do it when I get around to it, all right?
FO300024746	What I mean is, I need this research, and you're probably going to get irradiated out there, anyway. So why not come back here and help me, too?
FO300024747	You realize how ridiculous this request is, right?
FO300024748	Neither is going around all the time with a loaded gun or running with sharp objects, but people do those things all the time!
FO300024749	You worry too much. Just be careful where you step, and I'm sure you'll be fine!
FO300024750	I don't think walking around in a minefield is a very good idea.
FO300024751	Oh, it's perfectly fine, and made from organic ingredients. Well, it affects things' organs. That's close enough to being organic, right?
FO300024752	Either way, it's perfectly safe. Heck, once it got into food for Jericho, and he never even knew!
FO300024753	I'm not so sure about testing this stuff.
FO300024754	Okay, yes, they're jerks. But if they're intelligent, we can get them to stop. And train them. Maybe we could even ride them! That'd be fun!
FO300024755	Why do we care if they're intelligent? They still try to kill me.
FO300024756	Well, I could hardly be an impartial observer in that case, now could I? It'd ruin the validity of the entire experiment.
FO300024757	Besides, you wouldn't shoot me, now would you?
FO300024758	Why not study injuries on yourself? If it'd help, I could shoot you in the gut.
FO300024759	No, history is what losers become.
FO300024760	You go right back and talk to those people and find out something so we can make sure others learn from their successes!
FO300024761	History is for losers. I'll do it later.
FO300024762	The trader who sold me that insisted it was a snap to use. Just plug it into the mainframe, and it should take care of the rest.
FO300024763	Of course, if you played around with the systems after that, we'd probably learn even more. But you can deal with that when you get there.
FO300024764	Robots aren't really my style. I'll do it later.
FO300024765	I could swear I read that in an old book somewhere, so it's got to be true!
FO300024766	What if the building was destroyed and I can't even find its remains?
FO300024767	What better reward for avoiding explosives than to pay you with explosives? Frag grenades, in this case. I got a pretty good haul of them recently.
FO300024768	And if you bring me back something to study, maybe I can make some modifications for you. Nothing like tinkering with a live mine, right?
FO300024769	Did you know, when bones break and re-heal, they grow back tougher? In a way, you'd be repaying yourself. Once I make sure you survive, of course.
FO300024770	But in a more tangible way, I can give you a modified environmental suit of mine. How's that sound?
FO300024771	What could possibly be worth breaking my bones over?
FO300024772	The obvious answer would be, "a book." But I guess there might not be any left there, so how about I pay you with good old-fashioned caps?
FO300024773	Who knows what you could buy with all those caps? It could be anything. It could even be a book!
FO300024774	What do I get for going to the library?
FO300024775	Oh, don't worry so much about it. I'll be waiting here with a nice, tall glass of rad-cleansing brahmin milk for you when you get back.
FO300024776	Well, mostly just a whole lot of Rad-X and Rad-Away. And maybe even a more reliable way to get rid of radiation! Assuming it works, of course.
FO300024777	You want me to get irradiated? How could that possibly be worth it for me?
FO300024778	While you're working on that, I'll be following up on a lead I've got for a couple Stealth-Boys. When you're done, they're yours.
FO300024779	And who knows? Maybe we'll learn something useful from the Mirelurks.
FO300024780	Sneaking into a Mirelurk lair? The pay had better be worth it.
FO300024781	Well, you'll be getting access to an army of robots. That ought to be reward enough, right? But if you insist, I could spare some pulse grenades.
FO300024782	What's it worth to you?
FO300024783	There's my brave research assistant! Go out and get bashed up. For the good of mankind!
FO300024784	Just make sure you stay alive and get back here! That's important! I can't stress that enough!
FO300024785	Nothing beats a real-world example, they say. I'll get myself injured.
FO300024786	Wow, what a great research assistant you are! I mean really, that's dedication. Demonstrating how to withstand pain by getting injured? Wow.
FO300024787	When you're ready, come back here with some serious injuries, maybe a crippled limb or two, and I'll take notes and fix you up.
FO300024788	I'll be waiting here with plenty of bandages for you. So don't worry, and just go get horribly injured. Oh, and be careful!
FO300024789	I guess I'll get hurt eventually. Might as well come here when I do.
FO300024790	Oh, don't worry. No one ever goes there because they say it's a ghost town. And since ghosts don't exist, you can just focus on the landmines.
FO300024791	I hear there's a playground in the middle of the town. Reach that point and come back, and I'm sure you'll have some stories to tell!
FO300024792	I suppose, for the sake of proper research, I can go back into Minefield.
FO300024793	Oh, don't worry. No one ever goes there because they say it's a ghost town. And since ghosts don't exist, you can just focus on the landmines.
FO300024794	I hear there's a playground in the middle of the town. Reach that point and come back, and I'm sure you'll have some stories to tell!
FO300024795	I'll head into Minefield. Wish me luck.
FO300024796	Great! The library should be in old Arlington, not far from downtown. See if you can download the archives from its computer.
FO300024797	If you can't get those, then even the card catalog would be useful. Any little piece of information could help the book. And thus, humanity!
FO300024798	Okay, I'll check out my local library.
FO300024799	Now, that's the adventurous scientific spirit! Go on out there and get good and fried!
FO300024800	Oh, but not so much that you can't come back. 200 rads should be enough to get a reading, although 600 or more would be more useful!
FO300024801	Trust me, I'll make sure you're okay! I've got some good ideas for a cure!
FO300024802	I suppose nothing beats a real-world example. I'll get myself irradiated.
FO300024803	Now, 200 rads should be enough for basic sickness, but if you can get 600 or more rads, my tests will be even more accurate.
FO300024804	Just make sure you can get back here, and I'll see to it that you're well taken care of!
FO300024805	Okay, I'll get irradiated. Just be ready to fix me up when I get back.
FO300024806	That's great. I recommend the nest at the Anchorage War Memorial. I knew a trader who talked about the Mirelurks down there.
FO300024807	Just go inside and find one of their spawning pods, probably down near the water. Put this observer inside, and get out quietly.
FO300024808	And be sure not to kill any Mirelurks inside their nest! If you do, it could ruin the validity of the study!
FO300024809	All right, I'll try.
FO300024810	Yeah, you should just be able to plug it into the mainframe at the RobCo production facility. It'll give you access to the robots and terminals.
FO300024811	Okay, here. And be sure to keep an eye peeled for any other examples of how to make old technology work for you out there!
FO300024812	Just go in and connect the widget to the mainframe? I can do that.
FO300024813	Hopefully, you'll be finding food and medicine, but I could sweeten the deal by paying more food when you get back, regardless of the results.
FO300024814	While you're away, I can at least search through my junk and see if there's anything that'll go with old food to make it more appetizing.
FO300024815	What's the pay?
FO300024816	Don't worry about the chemicals. I handled them all the time while experimenting, and I'm perfectly fine, aren't I?
FO300024817	How about I let you have the leftover chems I used to make it? Heck, do a thorough job, and maybe I'll let you keep the repellent itself.
FO300024818	I don't know if handling weird chemicals is safe. What's it worth to you?
FO300024819	You mean, apart from making sure we don't repeat our tragic failures in a never-ending cavalcade of human pathos and suffering?
FO300024820	What's the value of digging up history?
FO300024821	Oh, great! Food is most important, but see if you can get medicine, too. And if there's nothing to find, then just come back in one piece, okay?
FO300024822	I guess I can check the Super-Duper Mart again.
FO300024823	Oh, great! Food is most important, but see if you can get medicine, too. And if there's nothing to find, then just come back in one piece, okay?
FO300024824	Okay, I'll check the Super-Duper Mart.
FO300024825	It'll be easy. One tap with the applicator, and it overwhelms their senses with a sort of "feel-bad" sensation. Then they're gone before you know it!
FO300024826	You could test it out on just a few Mole Ratties, but for real testing, try it on ten or more. There should be plenty in the Tepid Sewers, downtown.
FO300024827	I'll test out the Repellent for you.
FO300024828	Oh, now I can't wait for what you find out down there! And check around to make sure you're hearing the real deal!
FO300024829	Sounds reasonable. I'll research Rivet City's history.
FO300024830	I have something to say to you, Bittercup.
FO300024831	Oh, yeah, what is it? Um, not that I care what you think.
FO300024832	Why don't you seem to care about what's going on around here?
FO300024833	I dunno. What does it matter anyway? We're all going to be mutant chow eventually.
FO300024834	And what do you know?! You wastelanders and your dirty clothes and roughed up faces! YOU look like a serial killer!
FO300024835	Wait, what? Did you just hit on me?
FO300024836	Oh, um, well. I need to get going, but come back and visit me sometime, okay?
FO300024837	Oh, um, well. I need to get going, but come back and visit me sometime, okay?
FO300024838	Why, no. I'm not in any sort of relationship. Are you?
FO300024839	Oh, um, well. I need to get going, but come back and visit me sometime, okay?
FO300024840	Give me my marching orders, sir.
FO300024841	I want you to change how close you follow me.
FO300024842	If you don't mind me saying, you look different from everyone else.
FO300024843	Besides, if we're all going to die here, I at least want my corpse to look better than these inane wastelanders.
FO300024844	I like your makeup. The pale-white really reflects the lighting.
FO300024845	That's why I never go out during the day. The moon has such a better shine to it than the sun.
FO300024846	You need to set yourself apart from the mold. Then people will respect you.
FO300024847	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Survival goes before style.
FO300024848	And what do you know?! You wastelanders and your dirty clothes and roughed up faces! YOU look like a serial killer!
FO300024849	Moons are nice. The calm nights of the Wastes are a great time to relax.
FO300024850	I was being sarcastic. That white makeup is like painting a target on your head.
FO300024851	And what do you know?! You wastelanders and your dirty clothes and roughed up faces! YOU look like a serial killer!
FO300024852	Actually, never mind. There's something else I need to know.
FO300024853	Ugh, hurry up. I have poetry I need to write. Dark poetry.
FO300024854	So you knew my mother?
FO300024855	Heard anything juicy about the neighbors?
FO300024856	What's the good word?
FO300024857	Got any plans for today?
FO300024858	MS12ResidentsNeighborsTenpenny
FO300024859	There are some Ghouls who want to live here. What do you think about that?

FO300024888	I'm looking for the factory's shipping manifests.
FO300024889	That information is in the Shipping Computer Terminal. The pass code for the terminal is NC-C1864.
FO300024890	Oh boo hoo. People die all the time.
FO300024891	Well! That's the most insulting thing anyone has ever said to me!
FO300024892	Here I offer my hospitality and you spit it right back in my face.
FO300024893	Any information you could give me on the caves below Oasis would be helpful.
FO300024894	Oasis is located near what used to be an old mining town before the bombs fell.
FO300024895	When the attacks started about 200 years ago, many people took shelter in the natural caves that dotted the area.
FO300024896	The old gate that stands at the mouth of Oasis Cave is the last piece of architecture from those days.
FO300024897	Just like a cancer would infest our bodies, the caves below us are infested with vermin.
FO300024898	You'd do well to be cautious down there, we've lost a few Treeminders in the past.
FO300024899	If the Great One knows you to be worthy of his grace, he will allow you to pass through to his heart.
FO300024900	Be wary of the water in the caves, I fear they still carry the sting of radiation from the bombs.
FO300024901	Sure. Here you go. Good luck to you!
FO300024902	May I have the key to the caves?
FO300024903	Leave it to good old Bob to get me stuck above some caves. Now my dang feet are cold!
FO300024904	I have some quick questions about those caves.
FO300024905	Your names are quite strange. What do they mean?
FO300024906	The first part of our name represents our role in the Treeminders. The youngest are the Saplings, still learning what it means to live in Oasis.
FO300024907	The Branchtenders are our guardians and keep our homes safe. Our healers and soothsayers are known as Bloomseers.
FO300024908	Finally, the Tree Father and the Leaf Mother are the creators and the upholders of the Great One's laws.
FO300024909	You have a point there. Maybe I'm just losing my marbles from all this boredom.
FO300024910	I swear if I try real hard, I can see all around me like my eyes are in every leaf on every tree.
FO300024911	I think it's making Bob kind of jealous, cause he was the first tree in my life and all that.
FO300024912	See me coming? That's not possible.
FO300024913	I'm telling you, it is possible, or maybe I'm just losing my mind from all this boredom.
FO300024914	I swear if I try real hard, I can see all around me like my eyes are in every leaf on every tree.
FO300024915	I think it's making Bob kind of jealous, cause he was the first tree in my life and all that.
FO300024916	Seeing me approach Oasis is quite a feat for a living tree.
FO300024917	Maybe I'm just losing my mind from all this boredom, but I swear if I try I can see all around me like my eyes are in every leaf on every tree.
FO300024918	I think it's making Bob kind of jealous, cause he was the first tree in my life and all that.
FO300024919	If people thought I was a god, I'd exploit it for all it's worth!
FO300024920	I had them sing me songs, I made them do stupid dances and things like that. Bob even told me to make Maple stand on his head for a whole day!
FO300024921	After a while though, it just gets boring. Then it becomes a nuisance and now it's completely driving me nuts!
FO300024922	When I saw you coming towards Oasis, I thought I felt that you'd understand me. I guess I was wrong.
FO300024923	I understand what you mean.
FO300024924	I knew you would. That's why I picked you when I saw you coming.
FO300024925	Hey, life is a gift. Even if it lasts a long time, be glad you have it!
FO300024926	Can you imagine THAT? Stuck here for centuries? I can't do it, I just want to be alone. Just me and Bob until the end.
FO300024927	When I saw you coming towards Oasis, I thought I felt that you'd understand me. I guess I was wrong.
FO300024928	You don't actually seem that sad. Why do you want to die?
FO300024929	Can you imagine being stuck in one place for that long not being able to eat or to read or to sleep or anything?
FO300024930	In the meantime, I have these Treeminders bothering me every day about things I don't even care about. I can't stand it anymore.
FO300024931	Is there anything down there to look out for?
FO300024932	Sometimes I feel stuff tickling me, but I think that's just Bob getting back at me for all the times I called him Herbert.
FO300024933	How do I get into the caves?
FO300024934	I think the best way for you to get down there would be to get the key from the one those loonies call "Cypress."
FO300024935	There's supposed to be some old gate or something back in the other grove.
FO300024936	How did this all happen, Reilly?
FO300024937	We were mapping the Vernon Square part of the downtown ruins and got jumped by a Super Mutant ambush party.
FO300024938	Usually it isn't a problem, but this group was bigger than usual. We fought our way into Our Lady of Hope Hospital, hoping to find cover.
FO300024939	Eventually the fight spilled into the Statesman Hotel and we ran all the way to the roof.
FO300024940	I left my guys up there and tried to stealth out but got caught by a Mutie ambush patrol. That was the last thing I remember.
FO300024941	Oh, it's been centuries. The planet is a lush, green paradise once again.
FO300024942	Huh? What the hell are you talking about? That isn't very funny.
FO300024943	Oh shit! My team! What the hell happened?
FO300024944	What difference does it make?
FO300024945	Well, I don't know actually. Kind of confused.
FO300024946	Wait! Oh shit!
FO300024947	Not long, fortunately.
FO300024948	Wait! Oh shit!
FO300024949	Okay, thanks. Got to go.
FO300024950	No problem, just don't disturb the patients.
FO300024951	She your new toy, zombie?
FO300024952	That kind of talk is uncalled for. I was, am and always will be a doctor of medicine.
FO300024953	I don't care if she was a Super Mutant. I'd still help her.
FO300024954	If they hauled your sorry, shot-up body into my clinic, I'd try and save you too.
FO300024955	MS14DukovRecordedNote
FO300024956	Tara's dead. Crowley fucked up and got her killed. Fucking ghoul. When I'm done, he'll sniff butts with the ferals for the rest of his life.
FO300024957	Your "Republic" is a joke, and your presidency is a farce. You need to die.
FO300024958	What! How dare you! I'm going to have you executed.
FO300024959	Help! Your president is being attacked!
FO300024960	How did all of you meet?
FO300024961	Tenpenny hired us as mercs. He wanted some fancy fucking gun.
FO300024962	Don't know how he got Crowley to sign on. Tenpenny fucking hates Ghouls.

FO300024964	Ha, ha! No, clown shoes. Tenpenny hired a whole fucking team.
FO300024965	Strayer, Crowley, Tara, Dave and me. Tara had a pair on her! Sweet Jesus they were nice. Ha, ha!
FO300024966	That place fucked her up more than I did. The rest of us went our separate ways after that.
FO300024967	Let's just get this over with.
FO300024968	I'm glad you've chosen to see reason.
FO300024969	Again, I present you with a simple little job. The Rockwells have a seemingly happy marriage. I'd like you to put an end to it.
FO300024970	The only caveat is that you may not kill either of them in the process. I look forward to seeing what you're capable of.
FO300024971	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Calm down, there. Amata's not in any danger.
FO300024972	I mean, we're all in a sort of a rough patch, but we've weathered worse.
FO300024973	MS13GrouseWarning
FO300024974	You ain't allowed up there, you hear me? Go any farther and you're a dead man. I ain't warning you twice.
FO300024975	You ain't allowed up there, you hear me? Take one more step and they'll be scraping you off the pavement. Ain't gonna warn you again.
FO300024976	No, I haven't. Say, does that hurt?
FO300024977	No, it tickles. Everyone's got to be a comedian.
FO300024978	Say, for someone who hasn't seen many Ghouls before, you don't seem too bothered.
FO300024979	I could use someone like you. How would you feel about working for a Ghoul?

FO300024986	You "want to look around?" Where the hell do you think you are? Stop wasting my time, asshole.
FO300024987	I won't cause any trouble. I just want to look around.
FO300024988	You "want to look around?" Where the hell do you think you are? Stop wasting my time, asshole.
FO300024989	I won't cause any trouble. I just want to look around.
FO300024990	There's two kinds of people who get into Paradise Falls. Slaves and Slavers.
FO300024991	So, unless you're looking to become a slave, piss off.
FO300024992	Why can't I go up there?
FO300024993	There's two kinds of people who get into Paradise Falls. Slaves and Slavers.
FO300024994	So, unless you're looking to become a slave, piss off.
FO300024995	Why can't I go up there?
FO300024996	I think it would be good for the Republic, Mister President.
FO300024997	Of course it would. I knew that. You heard me say that before, didn't you. It was my idea after all. Here, take it.
FO300024998	Your audience is over.
FO300024999	Are you sure I can't just have that key, handsome? You know, as a present?
FO300025000	For you, sweet cheeks? Sure thing!
FO300025001	Now, how about I show you how I keep my two bitches happy all night long?
FO300025002	How about I let you live, and you give me something so I can lie to Crowley?
FO300025003	Just give me the key. Don't ask why.
FO300025004	Okay, dude, Don't have a cow. Here, take it.
FO300025005	Okay, dude, Don't have a cow. Here, take it all.
FO300025006	Just give me all your stuff. And don't ask any questions.
FO300025007	You want to kill humans? I thought it would just be Ghouls. No way.
FO300025008	Watch the attitude, human. Right here, right now, there are more of us than there are of you.
FO300025009	Maybe. I don't know if I trust you.
FO300025010	The feeling's mutual, smoothskin. But that never stopped a business deal.
FO300025011	A lot of you humans are bigots. You don't like Ghouls and treat us like zombies, calling us brain eaters and shufflers.
FO300025012	I don't need to stay here and listen to your lame insults.
FO300025013	That's it. Run away like a smoothskin coward.
FO300025014	I don't need some old clothes you found. Time to die, freak.
FO300025015	Well, please give the clothes to someone who needs them.
FO300025016	I'm sorry for annoying you. Maybe it's best that I leave you now.
FO300025017	No, you're not. I want you to take it as a gift. I meant to give it to you anyway.
FO300025018	Have you ever watched the moon rise over the Wasteland? I only wish I had something as wonderful as that to give you.
FO300025019	Um. Thanks.
FO300025020	I know it isn't much, but it's all I have.
FO300025021	Have you ever watched the moon rise over the Wasteland? I wish I could have given you something as wonderful as that.
FO300025022	Give me everything you've got and I might let you live.
FO300025023	I'm sorry, I've been a poor host. Please, take this. It isn't much, but I want you to have it.
FO300025024	How'd you get the name Uncle Leo?
FO300025025	I don't know. I've always called myself that.
FO300025026	I just wanted to get a good look at your ugly mug before I blew it away.
FO300025027	Don't worry, I'm not offended. I know that I am a hideous monstrosity, fit only to be hunted down and killed.
FO300025028	A talking Super Mutant? What next, a dog on a bicycle?
FO300025029	Ah, you joke with me. I understand. A dog on a bicycle would be laughable, ridiculous, just like me.
FO300025030	Who are you? I've never met a friendly Super Mutant before.
FO300025031	I was driven out by my brothers.
FO300025032	I tried to get them to understand that there was more to life than fighting and killing, but they wouldn't listen.
FO300025033	Now I wander the Wasteland, hoping to find some meaning to life before I die.
FO300025034	That's disgusting! I'm old enough to be your grandmother. I won't have that kind of talk in this house.
FO300025035	I play songs on my homemade violin and people trade me goods. Sellbaby, indeed!
FO300025036	If not in person, I play it over my husband's old radio set. The men in the caravan say it keeps their morale up on lonely nights in the Wasteland.
FO300025037	A frail old lady like yourself should be careful out here all alone.
FO300025038	Old? Yes. Frail? No.
FO300025039	I can still hold my own if I have to. My husband made me learn a thing or two about how to defend myself.
FO300025040	Besides, I have a caravan come through here about once a week to trade. They'd miss me if I was gone.
FO300025041	How about we make it 300 caps?
FO300025042	Well, that's wonderful. Here are your caps. Thanks very much!
FO300025043	Well, that's wonderful. Here are your caps. Thanks very much!
FO300025044	Let me consider your offer.
FO300025045	Certainly, don't let me stand in your way.
FO300025046	Sure, that sounds fair.
FO300025047	Well, that's wonderful. Here are your caps. Thanks very much!
FO300025048	Well, that's wonderful. Here are your caps. Thanks very much!
FO300025049	I have a very unique item for sale, a genuine Stradivarius violin.
FO300025050	Incredible! I've heard of those items. They were used to make music many many years ago I believe.
FO300025051	Well, although it has no American historical significance, I can take it off your hands for 200 caps. How does that sound?
FO300025052	Absolutely! I believe the standing offer was 200 caps.
FO300025053	Are you still interested in the Stradivarius?
FO300025054	Do I look like I play in a fucking orchestra? Why should I care?
FO300025055	So you want me to risk my ass for a violin that's probably rotted away by now?
FO300025056	Don't you think I've thought of that?
FO300025057	She kept it in a special pressurized case. Inside the case is the perfect temperature and humidity for the instrument.
FO300025058	Hilda's Stradivarius was named the Soil Stradivarius. All of them had names. That's what I want you to get.
FO300025059	After 200 years, how can you be certain the violin is in decent shape?
FO300025060	She kept it in a special pressurized case. Inside the case is the perfect temperature and humidity for the instrument.
FO300025061	If the case is still functioning, the Stradivarius would be in perfect shape.
FO300025062	Hilda's Stradivarius was named the Soil Stradivarius. All of them had names. That's what I want you to get.
FO300025063	If you're that eager to get going I'll skip the story. I'm looking for a particular violin called the Soil Stradivarius.
FO300025064	Its located in Vault 92, where my great great grandmother once lived.
FO300025065	This violin she owned, was it valuable?
FO300025066	I think the opportunity to use that fine instrument with her fellow accomplished musicians was more than a draw for Hilda.
FO300025067	Then, the bombs fell. The Vault was sealed, and my family never heard from her again.
FO300025068	Musical talent? Why would they care about that?
FO300025069	Vault-Tec was always promoting the Vaults being used for the preservation of the arts and all that nonsense.
FO300025070	Hilda couldn't pass on a chance to meet many of the other musical talents of the world, so she accepted their invitation.
FO300025071	Then the bombs fell. The Vault was sealed, and my family never heard from her again.
FO300025072	This already sounds kind of like a wild goose chase.
FO300025073	A famous man once said that patience is the companion of wisdom. If you shut your trap and listen, you might learn something.
FO300025074	Anyway, Hilda was quite a special woman. Classically trained and exceptionally talented at the violin.
FO300025075	Her pride and joy was her Stradivarius Violin. I can only imagine how exquisite this instrument must have been.
FO300025076	When war reared its head, she was invited by Vault-Tec into Vault 92. They claimed the vault would be dedicated to preserving musical talent.
FO300025077	2077? I can't even imagine that long ago.
FO300025078	It certainly is a long time. That precious instrument has been through a lot.
FO300025079	Anyway, Hilda was quite a special woman. Classically trained and exceptionally talented at the violin.
FO300025080	Her pride and joy was her Stradivarius Violin. I can only imagine how exquisite this instrument must have been.
FO300025081	When war reared its head, she was invited by Vault-Tec into Vault 92. They claimed the vault would be dedicated to preserving musical talent.
FO300025082	You have records from back then?
FO300025083	Of a kind, yes. Hilda sent a good deal of letters to my great grandmother Mary who passed them on, and so forth.
FO300025084	I suppose the correspondence could be considered a diary of sorts.
FO300025085	You have a lot to learn about dealing with people, young man. However, you're right. I need to think of your needs too.
FO300025086	I have a small amount of ammunition that my husband left behind. A box of odds and ends. I don't think I've opened it in years.
FO300025087	If you do this for me, you're welcome to take whatever you need.
FO300025088	You have a lot to learn about dealing with people, young lady. However, you're right. I need to think of your needs too.
FO300025089	I have a small amount of ammunition that my husband left behind. A box of odds and ends. I don't think I've opened it in years.
FO300025090	If you do this for me, you're welcome to take whatever you need.
FO300025091	I want to help you, but that type of search could cost me greatly.
FO300025092	You have a point. Perhaps I've been neglecting needs that you might have and being selfish.
FO300025093	I have a small amount of ammunition that my husband left behind. A box of odds and ends. I don't think I've opened it in years.
FO300025094	If you do this for me, you're welcome to take whatever you need.
FO300025095	You are a clever one!
FO300025096	Yes, that's exactly the problem that I have with it. It doesn't quite play all of the notes correctly and I have to constantly tinker with it.
FO300025097	Wow, Reilly. You look like shit.
FO300025098	You got a lot of class, kid.
FO300025099	I feel worse than I look, but that doesn't even matter to me. I'm just worried about the rest of the Rangers.
FO300025100	I don't even know if they're still alive.
FO300025101	Forget it. I may as well shoot myself in the head and save the trouble.
FO300025102	Wow. You really are an asshole. Fine. I hope their deaths sit well on your conscience.
FO300025103	Did you set any kinds of traps or mines?
FO300025104	Actually, we did lay down a bunch of countermeasures. I don't know how many of them have already gone off though.
FO300025105	When I slipped out with my Stealth Boy, I think I almost tripped one or two of them.
FO300025106	Damn near didn't make it out of there at all, come to think of it.
FO300025107	Laugh it up, kid. It's easy for you to make fun of me now when I'm in this condition.
FO300025108	Keep making jokes and I'll show you what it's like to be in a coma.
FO300025109	I've heard of you guys. You pack some serious firepower.
FO300025110	You're pretty sharp, kid.
FO300025111	We pack plenty of firepower, but that didn't help us from getting our asses into serious trouble.
FO300025112	I didn't expect to make it out of there alive.
FO300025113	Let's skip all the story and get to the point. What do you need?
FO300025114	So you're that eager to jump in headfirst, eh? You remind me a lot of some crazy mercs I knew back in the day.
FO300025115	They're all dead now because they were stupid, but suit yourself.
FO300025116	My team is trapped on the roof of the Statesman Hotel in Vernon Square and completely surrounded by Super Mutants.
FO300025117	Their ammo is almost gone, and I have no idea how much longer they have to live.
FO300025118	Suit yourself.
FO300025119	Actually, I get the point.
FO300025120	I don't think you're in any condition to be up and about.
FO300025121	That's not the way I do things.
FO300025122	Do you have any idea what it would do to my reputation if word got around that Reilly of Reilly's Rangers was laid up in a hospital bed?
FO300025123	Well then, I guess I'll just have to kill you.
FO300025124	That's it. GUARDS!
FO300025125	Your boss. So you'd better let me past before you get in trouble.
FO300025126	Colonel Autumn is the only one authorized to see the President.
FO300025127	Don't move. I'm going to find out what's going on here.
FO300025128	Maybe I can fix the elevator.
FO300025129	Maybe you can, but we'd still need the fission battery. It's the only way to locally feed power into the elevator's electronics.
FO300025130	Look, let's get out of here and I promise I'll take you to her.
FO300025131	Anyway, sorry. Ahem. The only way off of the roof now is using the express elevator.
FO300025132	I'll call the shots from here.
FO300025133	You can call anything you like, but the other Rangers will only follow me.
FO300025134	So, let me know what you want to do, and then I'll decide if we're going to do it.
FO300025135	The shit's about to hit the fan up here, and you're asking questions?
FO300025136	Look, Reilly once told me all we got in this shitty world is each other. I buy into that theory quite a bit.
FO300025137	We watch each other's backs and that's what keeps us alive.
FO300025138	If she's dead and you just followed our transmission, I want to know about it!
FO300025139	Well, looks like you got yourselves into a mess. Nice work.
FO300025140	Tough guy routine, eh?
FO300025141	I don't give a shit what you think about us. I just want to get the hell out of here.
FO300025142	Now, what happened to Reilly? Is she okay?
FO300025143	Tough guy routine, eh?
FO300025144	I don't give a shit what you think about us. I just want to get the hell out of here.
FO300025145	Now, what happened to Reilly? Is she okay?
FO300025146	A medic, huh? Can you patch me up?
FO300025147	Sorry, no can do. I used the last of my supplies on us when we got to the roof.
FO300025148	I can still put a bullet through a Super Mutant skull though!
FO300025149	Now, what's up with Reilly? She okay?
FO300025150	Sorry, no can do. I used the last of my supplies on us when we got to the roof.
FO300025151	I can still put a bullet through a Super Mutant skull though!
FO300025152	Now, what's up with Reilly? She okay?
FO300025153	I don't understand. I can't see you.
FO300025154	You are seeing me in a way that only a few select individuals have. Wouldn't they be jealous?
FO300025155	Colonel Autumn is the only human permitted in this room besides yourself, for reasons which may now be clear to you.
FO300025156	Is this some kind of a joke?
FO300025157	No, it's not.
FO300025158	I am the computer you see before you. Well, that and several thousand databanks beneath this room.
FO300025159	Well then, where are you? All I see is computers.
FO300025160	You should feel privileged. Colonel Autumn is the only other human permitted within this room.
FO300025161	You are now privy to one of the few secrets our government now harbors. Do keep it to yourself, please.
FO300025162	If we're meeting face to face, then show yourself. Don't hide behind a monitor.
FO300025163	Ah, but I have! I am right here before you.
FO300025164	Sure. You stay here while I get the caps. I'll be right back.
FO300025165	Don't take too long.
FO300025166	On second thought, you're not worth the caps.
FO300025167	GUARDS!
FO300025168	Look, here are the caps. Let's just pretend we never saw each other.
FO300025169	Well, okay. Hand 'em over.
FO300025170	500 caps says you never saw me. Understand?
FO300025171	Are you bribing me?
FO300025172	I'm on my way up to see the President. How about I put in a good word for you?
FO300025173	Just make sure he knows I was real strict with you, okay? And that I didn't have my uniform on backwards this time.
FO300025174	So that's your story? I can't believe I stood here and listened to it.
FO300025175	You're a good friend to have such patience with me. I'm glad you listened even though you didn't want to.
FO300025176	Like I said, you were lucky to get away.
FO300025177	Maybe. I might not have met you today if those humans hadn't chased me.
FO300025178	Like I said, bad luck for you.
FO300025179	Maybe. I might not have met you today if those humans hadn't chased me.
FO300025180	I've had enough of this pointless story. Shut up already.
FO300025181	Of course. I'm sorry. Other than you, I only have myself to talk to. I know very little about civilized conversation.
FO300025182	Do you still have any? I could use some water.
FO300025183	I wish I had some to give you, but I'm afraid I lost it all.
FO300025184	I gathered up all I could carry, and once my leg felt better I climbed out of the hole and went on my way.
FO300025185	The next day, I came upon a group of humans. Usually your people leave me alone, but they saw the water I was carrying and attacked.
FO300025186	I dropped the water and ran for my life. I'm afraid my brothers would find me very contemptible.
FO300025187	That was a stroke of good luck.
FO300025188	Maybe.
FO300025189	I gathered up all I could carry, and once my leg felt better I climbed out of the hole and went on my way.
FO300025190	The next day, I came upon a group of humans. Usually your people leave me alone, but they saw the water I was carrying and attacked.
FO300025191	I dropped the water and ran for my life. I'm afraid my brothers would find me very contemptible.
FO300025192	Tell your crazy stories to somehow who cares.
FO300025193	Of course. I'm sorry. You're really the only person I have to talk to. I forget myself sometimes.
FO300025194	Obviously you got out somehow.
FO300025195	True.
FO300025196	After I had rested, I looked around. I was in an old basement. There were bottles of pure water stacked everywhere.
FO300025197	That sounds bad.
FO300025198	Maybe.
FO300025199	After I had rested, I looked around. I was in an old basement. There were bottles of pure water stacked everywhere.
FO300025200	You'd rather those Raiders caught you? Maybe you are crazy.
FO300025201	After we last met, I was climbing a small hill when the ground crumbled beneath me and I fell into a dark pit.
FO300025202	My leg was hurt in the fall, so I couldn't climb out.
FO300025203	You think being attacked by Raiders is good luck?
FO300025204	After we last met, I was climbing a small hill when the ground crumbled beneath me and I fell into a dark pit.
FO300025205	My leg was hurt in the fall, so I couldn't climb out.
FO300025206	Maybe? What do you mean?
FO300025207	After we last met, I was climbing a small hill when the ground crumbled beneath me and I fell into a dark pit.
FO300025208	My leg was hurt in the fall, so I couldn't climb out.
FO300025209	Lucky for you that you got away, huh?
FO300025210	Maybe.
FO300025211	Sounds like you've been having some bad luck.
FO300025212	Maybe.
FO300025213	You said "before I became this." What did you mean?
FO300025214	In the cold, dark, metal place, where my brothers bring their captives, endlessly trying to make more of us.
FO300025215	It was something I could not do. I tried to get them to stop. But they wouldn't listen. They would have killed me if I had not run away.
FO300025216	Don't you try to blame this on us! It was all my father and his cronies who tried to keep us from ever going outside.
FO300025217	Oh, nice job. I'm gone for a bit and you screw the whole place up.
FO300025218	Yes, sir.
FO300025219	Sure, whatever.
FO300025220	Yes, of course.
FO300025221	Yes, sir.
FO300025222	Don't you have anything better to do?
FO300025223	I'm interested in trading.
FO300025224	We always need bullets. Takes damn near a hundred of 'em to kill a 'Guai.
FO300025225	Always good ta hear. Lesse what ya got.
FO300025226	Hmm. Good point. Best to leave him alone.
FO300025227	Oh, come on. He'll listen to reason. Go talk to him.
FO300025228	What's that guy's problem?
FO300025229	If I try to leave, he'll set them off. But I can't stay here any longer!
FO300025230	Why don't you just go over and see what he's yelling about?
FO300025231	No! No way! He'll set the bombs off if I go anywhere near him!

FO300025233	And the sun will rise in the north! No! the northwest! For forty-four days and sixty-seven nights! And we'll never notice!
FO300025234	The sky will fall! The Earth will rise! The stars will shine open their toothy grins and caress the sun with their love!
FO300025235	A great crack shall open in the Earth and swallow the non-believers! And they shall weep! Weep! Weep! Tears and salt and earth and dirt!
FO300025236	Try new BLAMMO! Soap! Blasts stains out! Blasts the whole world out! We've all been BLAMMO'd!
FO300025237	I had no idea. This is fascinating.
FO300025238	I'm glad you think so. Perhaps a bit later we can discuss it in more detail.
FO300025239	Right now, I'd like to focus on why you're here. I've asked you here for a reason, and you and I need to talk about it.
FO300025240	This is crazy. A computer is running the Enclave?
FO300025241	I assure you that I am much more than a simple computer.
FO300025242	But let's not get bogged down in the details just yet. You are here for a purpose, and I'd like to discuss it with you.
FO300025243	I don't think this is funny.
FO300025244	I can't imagine why you would. I assure you this is not a joke.
FO300025245	But before you pass judgment, I'd like to discuss why you're here.
FO300025246	I guess you'll just have to live with your choice.
FO300025247	Hey, its my life. Butt out.
FO300025248	Damn straight.
FO300025249	Your life, your choice.
FO300025250	Admit it. You're just a whore.
FO300025251	Up yours! It's not like I've got a lot of other options.
FO300025252	The only survival skill I've got is the one I'm using here.
FO300025253	I'd rather be a whore than dead.
FO300025254	So basically, you're just a whore?
FO300025255	Damn! I wish I had a setup like this.
FO300025256	You're a pig, you know that?
FO300025257	I'm only doing this because he can keep me safe. He's a lot tougher than he looks.
FO300025258	I'm not sure how much longer that will be enough though.
FO300025259	Sweet for him maybe.
FO300025260	I'm just along for the ride. He's good with a gun and knows where to get booze.
FO300025261	Lucky bastard. He's got a sweet setup here.
FO300025262	So you're not really in control of the Enclave, then.
FO300025263	Make no mistake. I am the Enclave.
FO300025264	The organization is merely experiencing some growing pains. All will be sorted out in time.
FO300025265	I'd better go before I get a headache.
FO300025266	You need to drink more. Ha, ha!
FO300025267	It's my hidey hole. Nobody can fuck with me here.
FO300025268	I got my women and my booze. What the hell else is there?
FO300025269	It's my hidey hole. Nobody can fuck with me here.
FO300025270	My women are gone, but I've got my booze. That's enough.
FO300025271	Pretty much he just does a lot of drinking and partying.
FO300025272	You're obviously crazier than they are. Why would I listen to you?
FO300025273	I can't say I blame you. Its my mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
FO300025274	Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
FO300025275	What do you say Herbert, should I give them another chance?
FO300025276	Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
FO300025277	I'm not the killing type.
FO300025278	No, I suppose you aren't. My mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
FO300025279	Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
FO300025280	What do you say Herbert, should I give them another chance?
FO300025281	Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
FO300025282	You've become an important part of their life. Without you, they're lost.
FO300025283	So, they really need me that badly, huh? I guess I never thought of it that way. Awfully selfish of me.
FO300025284	Should we give them another chance, Herbert?
FO300025285	Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
FO300025286	I could have used a pile of caps instead, but whatever.
FO300025287	I'm saddened that worldly possessions and wealth still drive you, but I'm glad to see you made the right choice in the end.
FO300025288	I believe there are a few Treeminders who wish to speak to you before you depart. I think you'll find their appreciation quite rewarding.
FO300025289	Good luck in all your journeys, my friend. I hope your time here has opened your heart as well as it opened your eyes.
FO300025290	Sure, I guess.
FO300025291	Perhaps you haven't learned quite as much as I hoped from your visit here, but I'm glad to see you made the right choice in the end.
FO300025292	I believe there are a few Treeminders who wish to speak to you before you depart. I think you'll find their appreciation quite rewarding.
FO300025293	Good luck in all your journeys, my friend. I hope your time here has opened your heart as well as it opened your eyes.
FO300025294	I was glad to do it. Oasis needs to be shared with the world.
FO300025295	In your short visit here I can see you've learned much. That's a rare gift in these turbulent times.
FO300025296	I believe there are a few Treeminders who wish to speak to you before you depart. I think you'll find their appreciation quite rewarding.
FO300025297	Good luck in all your journeys, my friend. I hope your time here has opened your heart as well as it opened your eyes.
FO300025298	I could have used a pile of caps instead, but whatever.
FO300025299	I'm saddened that worldly possessions and wealth still drive you, but I'm glad to see you made the right choice in the end.
FO300025300	I believe there are a few Treeminders who wish to speak to you before you depart. I think you'll find their appreciation quite rewarding.
FO300025301	Good luck in all your journeys, my friend. I hope your time here has opened your heart as well as it opened your eyes.
FO300025302	Sure, I guess.
FO300025303	Perhaps you haven't learned quite as much as I hoped from your visit here, but I'm glad to see you made the right choice in the end.
FO300025304	I believe there are a few Treeminders who wish to speak to you before you depart. I think you'll find their appreciation quite rewarding.
FO300025305	Good luck in all your journeys, my friend. I hope your time here has opened your heart as well as it opened your eyes.
FO300025306	I was glad to do it. Oasis needs to be protected.
FO300025307	In your short visit here I can see you've learned much. That's a rare gift in these turbulent times.
FO300025308	I believe there are a few Treeminders who wish to speak to you before you depart. I think you'll find their appreciation quite rewarding.
FO300025309	Good luck in all your journeys, my friend. I hope your time here has opened your heart as well as it opened your eyes.
FO300025310	Are you taking Jet over here?
FO300025311	You think that I need to be sober to cut a Ghoul's hair? Half the work is cutting the skin off.
FO300025312	These guys don't care how they look anyway. They just humor me.
FO300025313	How does a Ghoul end up as a barber?
FO300025314	I prefer "stylist" myself, but whatever works for you. Everyone has a gift, you know?
FO300025315	I just took up Jet. At least it passes the time, you know?
FO300025316	How about a haircut?
FO300025317	Now we're talking! What do you need?
FO300025318	Are you serious? Well alright! Let me get my knives!
FO300025319	Alright! A full head of hair to work with! What should I do?
FO300025320	You stay away from my hair.
FO300025321	Oh, c'mon! I don't ever get to work on an actual human!
FO300025322	I'm good! I promise! I'll take a few puffs and I'll give you the best haircut of your life! No charge or anything! It'll be fun!
FO300025323	About what? My hair?
FO300025324	Yeah, man! That's what I do! I cut hair!
FO300025325	I know, I know, you look around here and there ain't a lot of work to show off, right?
FO300025326	These corpses only got half a head of the stuff, so I never get a chance to work on a full head! C'mon! No charge!
FO300025327	I could care less about your problems. I'm out of here.
FO300025328	Your words carry no remorse, no caring.
FO300025329	I'm at a loss as to how this place failed to open your eyes, but more importantly, to open your heart.
FO300025330	Go now, Outsider. Go and never look back.
FO300025331	You'll make due.
FO300025332	Even though the Great One has left us, our memories of Him will never die.
FO300025333	With Bloomseer Poplar's help, I'm confident we can keep Oasis alive and carry on as Treeminders.
FO300025334	Go now, Outsider. Go but never forget the gifts the Great One bestowed upon us.
FO300025335	What will become of Oasis?
FO300025336	Even though the Great One has left us, our memories of Him will never die.
FO300025337	With Bloomseer Poplar's help, I'm confident we can keep Oasis alive and carry on as Treeminders.
FO300025338	Go now, Outsider. Go but never forget the gifts the Great One bestowed upon us.
FO300025339	Welcome back to the Wasteland, asshole.
FO300025340	You're words sting, Outsider. Normally I'd have you cast from this place for such a statement, but my eyes have been opened.
FO300025341	Before you reached His heart, He imparted his last words to me. He told me about his will to die and how I mistook this for some mystical sign.
FO300025342	How could I have been so blind? How could I have mislead all these people?
FO300025343	Perhaps if I would have spent more time getting to know Him, things would have turned out different.
FO300025344	And here I thought you'd be ready to kill me.
FO300025345	No, Outsider, my anger lay not with you, but with myself.
FO300025346	Before you reached His heart, He imparted his last words to me. He told me about his will to die and how I mistook this for some mystical sign.
FO300025347	How could I have been so blind? How could I have mislead all these people?
FO300025348	Perhaps if I would have spent more time getting to know Him, things would have turned out different.
FO300025349	I have to say I'm surprised you aren't angrier with me.
FO300025350	Before you reached His heart, He imparted his last words to me. He told me about his will to die and how I mistook this for some mystical sign.
FO300025351	How could I have been so blind? How could I have mislead all these people?
FO300025352	Perhaps if I would have spent more time getting to know Him, things would have turned out different.
FO300025353	How is it you're causing all of these things to grow around you?
FO300025354	In what we call the Harvest Month, the Great One creates seeds among his branches within seed pods.
FO300025355	At the end of this time, the pods open and the seeds are carried quite easily upon the wind. It's quite beautiful.
FO300025356	Wherever the seeds take purchase, they grow into trees, plants, grass or all manner of wonderful things.
FO300025357	What's causing this place to grow?
FO300025358	It's kind of embarrassing really. Once a year, Bob decides he's going to go ahead and start growing these weird pods filled with tiny seeds.
FO300025359	Well, all it takes is a good wind and the seeds just fly everywhere.
FO300025360	I call them Herbert's Seeds. He hates that!
FO300025361	Oh, you said violin? I thought you needed something else. Never mind.
FO300025362	Well then, you interested in helping me or am I just wasting my time?
FO300025363	Maybe. You gonna give me something for it?
FO300025364	Oh very well. I suppose I should have expected that from a Wastelander. Here's the key to my husband's ammo crate; take whatever you like.
FO300025365	It's like holding a chunk of history in the palm of my hands. Amazing, simply amazing.
FO300025366	I can't thank you enough. I wish I had something to give you, a more suitable reward for all your efforts.
FO300025367	All I can give you is the frequency to my radio set. Tune in whenever you feel like listening to the strains of an old woman's violin playing.
FO300025368	Yes, take this Stradivarius Violin I found in Vault 92.
FO300025369	It's like holding a chunk of history in the palm of my hands. Amazing, simply amazing.
FO300025370	I can't thank you enough. I wish I had something to give you, a more suitable reward for all your efforts.
FO300025371	All I can give you is the frequency to my radio set. Tune in whenever you feel like listening to the strains of an old woman's violin playing.
FO300025372	Tell me about this project you worked on with my father.
FO300025373	Project Purity, we called it. What do you want to know?
FO300025374	Why did my mother die? What happened?
FO300025375	Complications from childbirth. None of us were expecting it; we weren't as prepared as we could have been.
FO300025376	You have to understand, we were struggling with scavenged, derelict equipment. We did everything we could.
FO300025377	What was my father like back then?
FO300025378	James? He was very driven. Determined to change the world. Well, we all were back then, I suppose.
FO300025379	He was focused on two things, really. Making Project Purity work, and your mother.
FO300025380	But it seems that he never really was able to get over the idea. I'm frankly shocked that he waited all this time, and wants to try again.
FO300025381	I never knew my mother. What can you tell me about her?
FO300025382	It was a shame that she died. She had been excited to meet you.
FO300025383	Let's talk about something else.
FO300025384	Okay.
FO300025385	MS16NorthEast2
FO300025386	All right, then.
FO300025387	Well, that's okay, then.
FO300025388	MS16NorthEast1
FO300025389	It's just like up here, Pep. The place is a mess. I've got to be extra careful right about now.
FO300025390	Whole place is running a little too hot, but it'll calm down in time, like everything else around here.
FO300025391	I hope so, dear. I really do.
FO300025392	Maybe you can change the Overseer's mind, dear.
FO300025393	MS16Resistance3
FO300025394	Will do, Amata. You watch out for yourself, too.
FO300025395	You don't need to tell me. Just keep an eye on your father, all right?
FO300025396	That's a damned shame, but maybe they'll come around in time. Keep working at it.
FO300025397	Hard to lead your Tunnel Snakes when they're afraid of getting stepped on, huh? Well, keep at it.
FO300025398	Well, ain't you a bundle of smiles. If it were just about staying alive, we might as well stick with your Dad.
FO300025399	Look on the bright side, Amata: you get to look at my handsome mug again. Who wouldn't want that?
FO300025400	Pack of cowards, if you ask me. If they don't grow a spine soon, I'm heading out myself. I mean it this time!
FO300025401	Aw, let 'em stay down here. One day, I'm heading out there on my own. I mean it.
FO300025402	Keep talking to them. If we're going to take a stand, we really want them on our side.
FO300025403	I swear, what sort of "rebels" are they? Keep talking to them, okay?
FO300025404	Okay, keep listening, and see who else we can get to take a stand. And be careful up there.
FO300025405	Keep an ear out up there. They'll get sick of father's lockdown eventually, and then we'll all take a stand.
FO300025406	MS16Resistance2
FO300025407	Well, I guess it could be worse. But if I know father, he's not just going to change his mind on this.
FO300025408	That's better than nothing, I suppose. That may be all the good news we're getting, for now.
FO300025409	Not yet. Freddie doesn't want to get in trouble, and Wally thinks we shouldn't be going outside, anyway.
FO300025410	They're still scared: enough to stay quiet, but not enough to risk doing anything.
FO300025411	No development. They're still quiet and scared. We won't be getting any of them to make a stand anytime soon.
FO300025412	MS16Resistance1
FO300025413	It's not safe. We'll talk later.
FO300025414	Yeah, sure, rebels. Any luck convincing anyone else to stand up to Father?
FO300025415	We're not your ridiculous gang, Butch. We're actually trying to get something done. Any luck convincing more to join us?
FO300025416	Looks like we're secure. What's the word up there?
FO300025417	We're safe. How's everyone holding up in the dorms?
FO300025418	Calm down, old man. How's life in the west dorms?
FO300025419	Don't worry, we're fine. What's the word in the dorms?
FO300025420	Come on, Amata. Who's gonna mess with me?
FO300025421	You know me. The Butch man fears no Overseer.
FO300025422	Hold on. The walls have ears.
FO300025423	Looks like I made it through another day, for what that's worth. But I don't see much changing yet.
FO300025424	I wasn't taken away in the night, for what that's worth. That's about the best news I've got to report.
FO300025425	I survived the night, but I get the feeling there's change in the air. Don't know if it's good or bad, though.
FO300025426	I'm still alive, but I don't know how long that luck'll last. Seems like something big's about to transpire.
FO300025427	First time in your life you're a rebel with a cause, boy. Any luck convincing your friends to join you in it?
FO300025428	You've got to take this seriously, boy. Any luck getting anyone else to join us?
FO300025429	MS16Gossip3
FO300025430	I don't know. He's not really my type. But at least you're here, too!
FO300025431	Not really. I mean, sure he's cool, but I don't really like him like that. You know? I'm just glad you're here, too.
FO300025432	MS16Gossip2
FO300025433	I remember you said, yeah. That's so gross. Don't you wish it could be just Butch, instead?
FO300025434	Ew, that's just creepy. Wouldn't it be so much better if it was just Butch, instead? He's dreamy.
FO300025435	MS16Gossip1
FO300025436	It's awful. Stuck in one room with Miss Palmer? It's just weird.
FO300025437	Terrible! I can't believe I have to share a dorm with old lady Palmer. How creepy is that?
FO300025438	MS16Overseers3
FO300025439	We'll have the place back to normal in no time, sir. It'll just take some time to repair the damages he caused.
FO300025440	Don't blame yourself, sir. We'll scrub every last trace of his influence from these halls, and then everything can go back to normal.
FO300025441	MS16Overseers2
FO300025442	Yes. You're right, of course. It was a mistake to let the doctor into our home, but we'll soon recover from his treatment.
FO300025443	Indeed. As much as it seemed a good idea at the time, we should never have taken that doctor into our world.
FO300025444	MS16Overseers1
FO300025445	Sir? It's the only world we've ever known. With a regrettable exception, I suppose.
FO300025446	It's our home, sir. It's seen better days, of course, but we won't be making the same mistakes again, of course.
FO300025447	MS16Snakes3
FO300025448	Yeah, we rule. It's just not the same without Paul saying it.
FO300025449	MS16Snakes2
FO300025450	Freddie, there's more to this than just getting out of the dorm. It's about freedom and standing up to the Man! Tunnel Snakes rule!
FO300025451	Come on, have a little pride! What do Tunnel Snakes do? We don't sit around and hide in the dorm. We rule!
FO300025452	MS16Snakes1
FO300025453	We're all the gang there is, Butch. But yeah, it's better than just sitting here alone.
FO300025454	Better than sitting around at home, you know?
FO300025455	That's enough of the history lesson.
FO300025456	If you say so, honey.
FO300025457	So anyone can live in Megaton?
FO300025458	No. Space is limited these days. You see all of these people wandering around here? They live up in the common house and aren't really citizens.
FO300025459	Most people around here keep one eye open around strangers, but me, I can spot a Raider spy at 100 meters. I'm not worried about it at all.
FO300025460	But if having meetings and pretending to vote on things makes the others feel safer, so be it.
FO300025461	So it was just a collection of traders in the beginning?
FO300025462	Not at first. It was a collection of people trying to get into the vault, people worshipping the bomb, and a few other refugees.
FO300025463	Then the traders came. Now the caravans take care of most of the trading, but before they were set up, it was all Megaton.
FO300025464	I worked on the caravans with my father for a while. That's how I met that worthless bag of liver spots I call a husband.
FO300025465	Why did they build the walls?
FO300025466	Well, the Raiders, for one. Once the town got big enough, they'd wait until the traders and their guards were away, then come in and clean us out!
FO300025467	So, eventually, my father did something about it. Him and a few others organized the traders and the citizens and built the walls.
FO300025468	So we're pretty safe now. Still, I wish those Brotherhood of Steel fellers hadn't hit on such hard times. They really helped keep the wolves at bay.
FO300025469	I had another question about Megaton.
FO300025470	Sure thing, hon.
FO300025471	Why build the walls out of some old flying machine?
FO300025472	It's a hell of a lot easier than trying to find enough parts to build walls and houses from nothing. The scrap was there, why not use it?
FO300025473	Besides, it's sturdy. It keeps the Raiders and the dust storms out. Not all of us had the luck to be born in a vault, you know.
FO300025474	There are a lot of parts here for just one machine.
FO300025475	Good eye. You're right honey, there are. There was an air station a couple of miles from here. It'd been stripped of everything except the planes.
FO300025476	My daddy got a bunch of people together to go out there, break apart the machines and drag back what we could use. It took 'em a couple of months.
FO300025477	You can't even tell where the air station was anymore. The Wasteland just took it back.
FO300025478	So why didn't they move the bomb?
FO300025479	Some of us wanted to. But the Church of Atom was just getting its start then. We needed their help to build the walls and clear the wreckage.
FO300025480	If we'd have tried to move the bomb, they would have refused to help.
FO300025481	Besides, a lot of people just wanted to leave it alone. It didn't seem to be hurting anything and who knows what would happen if we messed with it.
FO300025482	I don't want to talk about Megaton anymore.
FO300025483	Well, you come on back any time you want to hear more.
FO300025484	Where did everyone else come from?
FO300025485	I think I get the picture.
FO300025486	All right then. Anything else you wanted to know?
FO300025487	Tell me about Lucas Simms.
FO300025488	That man tries to bring law to this place. Lost cause if you ask me, but I respect his trying. He does seem to keep people in line though.
FO300025489	Other than that weird cowboy thing of his, I don't have much to complain about.
FO300025490	Tell me about Colin Moriarty.
FO300025491	That man is the scum of the Earth. He keeps the drunks around here soaking in liquor and that poor Nova, that girl deserves better.
FO300025492	And don't even get me started on how he treats Gob. Just because the boy looks dead doesn't mean that he should be treated like that.
FO300025493	That man has his fingers in everything around here. Just watch what you say about him, it'll always get back.
FO300025494	Who's in charge around here?
FO300025495	Well, technically, no one. But you can't put two people in a room together without one of them trying to govern the other.
FO300025496	But it depends on who you ask. Lucas Simms appointed himself the Sheriff. He throws anyone out who causes too much trouble.
FO300025497	But Colin Moriarty runs just about everything else. Not much happens here that he doesn't know about. Or plan.
FO300025498	Well, technically, no one. But you can't put two people in a room together without one of them trying to govern the other.
FO300025499	But it depends on who you ask. Lucas Simms appointed himself the Sheriff. He throws anyone out who causes too much trouble.
FO300025500	Colin Moriarty used to run just about everything else. Not much happened here that he doesn't know about. Or plan. I guess he got what was coming.
FO300025501	Well, technically, no one. But you can't put two people in a room together without one of them trying to govern the other.
FO300025502	But it depends on who you ask. Lucas Simms appointed himself the Sheriff. Before he died, he threw anyone out who caused too much trouble.
FO300025503	Now Colin Moriarty runs just about everything. Not much happens here that he doesn't know about. Or plan. You ask me, he was behind Lucas' death.
FO300025504	Well, technically, no one. But you can't put two people in a room together without one of them trying to govern the other.
FO300025505	But it depends on who you ask. It used to be that Lucas Simms and Colin Moriarty fought each other for control.
FO300025506	But with the two of them gone, who's to say what will happen around here? I'm just hoping that the Raiders don't show up again.
FO300025507	What's this place made of?
FO300025508	You didn't have to walk, you just went to the air station, bought a ticket, and took to the skies. Anywhere in the world, you just up and flew there.
FO300025509	When the war happened, the machines started dropping from the sky. Everyone around here thinks that the bomb made the crater, but it didn't.
FO300025510	The crater provided good cover from the dust storms and when my daddy and the rest of the town decided to build the walls, they used what they had.
FO300025511	How did you get here?
FO300025512	I was born here, actually. Just like my papi. Oh, for a while I helped him scavenge and then later on his caravan.
FO300025513	But traipsing around the Wasteland is work for young people. After I met Nathan, I just wanted to stop moving around so much.
FO300025514	We've been here ever since. Of course, I can't say that it's been good for Nathan's sanity...
FO300025515	How did the town start?
FO300025516	Well, originally, it started as a hole in the ground. My papi talked about how his father and the original settlers just hid in this crater.
FO300025517	It was enough to keep them safe from the dust storms. When things cooled down and people started wandering into the Wastes, some stayed behind.
FO300025518	The wanderers started coming back here to trade their stuff. By the time my papi was born, the town was a full on trading center.
FO300025519	Papi got rich on the caravan routes and eventually convinced the others to build the walls to hold off the Raiders.
FO300025520	I had some questions about this town's history.
FO300025521	I can tell you just about anything you want to know, honey. Megaton's history ain't no secret.
FO300025522	We should just go back to our quarters.
FO300025523	It's our only chance, don't you see? We're getting out of here, just like the doctor. I'm not going to let anyone stop us.
FO300025524	Tom! No!
FO300025525	Tom! Be careful!
FO300025526	It's me! Tom Holden! Just let me through!
FO300025527	What are you doing? Are you crazy? We'll shoot! Dammit, Tom.
FO300025528	Sounds like my kind of people.
FO300025529	If that's your kind of people, then you really need to take a long look at yourself and decide just what the hell is wrong with you.
FO300025530	Well, wouldn't you kill if that was part of your contract?
FO300025531	That's the sort of crap Talon Company does. All they care about is getting paid.
FO300025532	Reilly's Rangers operate on a set of morals. We're here to help people, not as professional assassins.
FO300025533	Have you had run-ins with them?
FO300025534	Yeah, we've crossed paths. Fortunately, we just stepped out of each others way.
FO300025535	Brick almost turned it into a damn bloodbath when one of them spit on her boots, but I was able to hold her back.
FO300025536	Let's discuss something else.
FO300025537	Sure thing.
FO300025538	Whatever floats your boat.
FO300025539	Fine by me.
FO300025540	Sounds good.
FO300025541	What's the deal with Talon Company?
FO300025542	Let me give you a word of advice. Stay away from them, they give mercs a bad name.
FO300025543	They've been pretty active lately around the old Capital Building ruins. I'd recommend giving that area a wide berth.
FO300025544	On second thought, maybe I'll hang onto them.
FO300025545	Then quit wasting my damn time, asshole!
FO300025546	I don't have that many caps.
FO300025547	Oh well. Tough luck for you I guess.
FO300025548	That's very helpful. Here you go.
FO300025549	I suggest taking the door around the corner if you want to get where I think you're going. You'll find it unlocked in a moment.
FO300025550	If I were you, I'd speak to Vance before you poke around too much. You can usually find him on the mezzanine overlooking the common area.
FO300025551	Sounds like an interesting problem.

FO300025565	Is there not one human being with a shred of decency left in this entire back-asswards Wasteland?
FO300025566	Why? Why why why why why? Aggh! Faithful listeners, I'm disappointed. And you should be too.
FO300025567	My, my. What a curious turn of events. So here we have the kid from Vault 101, who by all accounts has a soul as black as charred Brahmin meat.
FO300025568	Until next time, this is Three Dog, and you're listening to Galaxy News Radio, Bringing you the truth, no matter how bad it hurts.
FO300025569	RadioGNRNewsStoryDad
FO300025570	Whoever lives in there sure as hell doesn't want what you're selling, and no, you can't knock down the door. It weighs like 13 tons.
FO300025571	Hey, and in case a light bulb just started glowin' over your head, you can flick the switch and forget about it. You're not getting into that vault.
FO300025572	So if you see James out there, you say hello. Be kind to our new brother, and show him that here on the outside, we always fight the good fight.
FO300025573	So I, the great and powerful Three Dog, set my brother straight. I told him what was what. Who are the winners, the losers, the movers and shakers.
FO300025574	Now, this cat, James is his name, had been in a hole for years! He needed to know what was what out here in the beautiful Capital Wasteland!
FO300025575	Well wouldn't you know it, someone's come out of it again! And, I kid you not, he came to visit yours truly right here in the studio!
FO300025576	Now, believe it or not, this one's still got people livin' in it! And every few years or so, someone comes scrabblin' out.
FO300025577	For those of you not in the know, to the northwest of Megaton there's this vault. Vault 101.
FO300025578	Seems we've got a bit of news. Just listen to this.
FO300025579	News time, children.
FO300025580	We interrupt our regularly scheduled program for some news.
FO300025581	Ah yes, time for the news.
FO300025582	Got lots of stuff goin' down in Post Apocalyptia these days. Here some of the latest news.
FO300025583	Arefu donates bloodpacks, and in exchange, you protect them.
FO300025584	Agreed. Please, take this proposal to Arefu. Speak with them and then return to me with their decision.
FO300025585	I thank you for showing me that your kind can be trusted after all. It is a lesson I will not forget.
FO300025586	Now, what of young Ian? Tell me his decision.
FO300025587	Arefu will sell you bloodpacks, and you'll leave the town alone.
FO300025588	Although I appreciate what you are trying to do, please realize that we have no money or goods to speak of.
FO300025589	What little money Karl makes with his shop goes to buying weapons and ammunition to protect ourselves.
FO300025590	I am very sorry, but perhaps you can make a better offer?
FO300025591	Arefu donates bloodpacks, and you leave the town alone.
FO300025592	Agreed. Please, take this proposal to Arefu. Speak with them and then return to me with their decision.
FO300025593	I thank you for showing me that your kind can be trusted after all. It is a lesson I will not forget.
FO300025594	Now, what of young Ian? Tell me his decision.
FO300025595	There must be an alternative source of blood you can survive on.
FO300025596	Many years ago, I survived by drinking from fresh bloodpacks I recovered from hospital ruins.
FO300025597	The problem with your idea is that these bloodpacks are scarce.
FO300025598	What do you propose?
FO300025599	Yes. In a way, I am brainwashing them. I am eliminating their fears, their inhibitions and their shame.
FO300025600	I have reined in their cravings and taught them to eat not of the flesh, but to drink of the blood.
FO300025601	Most importantly, they have a Family. A place where their quirks are tolerated and understood.
FO300025602	What you're doing here is brainwashing them, plain and simple.
FO300025603	Yes. In a way, I am brainwashing them. I am eliminating their fears, their inhibitions and their shame.
FO300025604	I have reined in their cravings and taught them to eat not of the flesh, but to drink of the blood.
FO300025605	Most importantly, they have a Family. A place where their quirks are tolerated and understood.
FO300025606	I think you're a collective of seriously messed up freaks.
FO300025607	I can see that you have no understanding of what I have accomplished here.
FO300025608	I tire of debating with those who are so narrow-minded.
FO300025609	You're vampires. Or at least you follow their fictional traditions.
FO300025610	Do you think I believe I can turn into a bat and fly away? Of course not. Do I cast my image in a mirror? Absolutely.
FO300025611	Now ask me if I believe these individuals from every corner of the Wasteland need me to give them a sense of purpose and identity.
FO300025612	I have shown these people the ways of the vampire. I've provided them shelter, organization and a sense of belonging.
FO300025613	Let me ask you something else.
FO300025614	Certainly.
FO300025615	Sure.
FO300025616	Okay.

FO300025636	Why? Because that kid from Vault 101 is the worst thing to happen to our neighborhood since radiation sickness.

FO300025695	What were you doing up here?
FO300025696	We were looking for Fat Man ammo. One of the Scribes found a reference to a storage box in some old documents.
FO300025697	We found the box, alright. And the key. But then the Mutants showed up. If I didn't know better, I'd swear that this was a trap!
FO300025698	But the only way that those Mutants will lay a hand on this key is over my cold, dead body.

FO300025711	Their names shall be written into the Scrolls to be remembered forever.
FO300025712	As for you, here is your reward. Use it well, and in good health.
FO300025713	I have two Holotags for you.
FO300025714	Their names shall be written into the Scrolls to be remembered forever.
FO300025715	As for you, here is your reward. Use it well, and in good health.
FO300025716	I have one Holotag for you.
FO300025717	Their names shall be written into the Scrolls to be remembered forever.
FO300025718	As for you, here is your reward. Use it well, and in good health.
FO300025719	Actually, I don't have any books to trade.
FO300025720	Then why are you wasting my time? Honestly. Do you think that's funny?
FO300025721	Take all the books I have.
FO300025722	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
FO300025723	Actually, never mind.
FO300025724	Very well.
FO300025725	I'll trade five.
FO300025726	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
FO300025727	I'll trade four.
FO300025728	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
FO300025729	I'll trade three.
FO300025730	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
FO300025731	I'll trade two.
FO300025732	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
FO300025733	I'll trade one.
FO300025734	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
FO300025735	I see. Thanks.
FO300025736	Certainly.
FO300025737	It is not my place to criticize Elder Lyons. All I will say to an outsider is that he is not a traditionalist. That is all.
FO300025738	What do you do in this library?
FO300025739	We have set up this area as a forward operations center for our project. The books we collect can be recorded with the computer systems here.
FO300025740	We then ship them under escort back to the Citadel for transcribing into the archives there.
FO300025741	Why are you collecting books?
FO300025742	Books represent the collected knowledge of the world before. Everything from a child's story book to a detailed technical guide has value.
FO300025743	By assembling and recording this knowledge, we scribes can analyze it and use it to further the goals of the Brotherhood.
FO300025744	Whatever our Elder decides that those goals are, that is.
FO300025745	I have Pre-War Books for you.
FO300025746	Excellent. How many are you willing to trade?
FO300025747	You have no such thing. I do not have time for these jokes.
FO300025748	The mighty Brotherhood is gathering books? Seriously?
FO300025749	The collected knowledge of a lost age is worth far more than any weapon. Do not underestimate the power of the written word.
FO300025750	But, I will overlook your disrespect because you can be of use. Should you come across any Pre-War Books in your travels, bring them here.
FO300025751	I will compensate you for every volume that you bring me. Think on it, and return when you have books to offer me.
FO300025752	And you want me to help you gather books, right?
FO300025753	Precisely. The collected knowledge of a lost age is worth far more than any weapon. So, return here with any books that you find in good condition.
FO300025754	I will compensate you for every volume that you bring me. Think on it, and return when you have books to offer me.
FO300025755	Money and the promise of mysterious compensation? I'm in.
FO300025756	If nothing else, I admire your commitment to your chosen focus.
FO300025757	But, to the point: My task here is to collect the written works of those who came before in order to supplement the Brotherhood archives.
FO300025758	So, return here with any Pre-War Books that you find and I will reward you for them. With money. Because that's what you like.
FO300025759	If nothing else, I admire your commitment to your chosen focus.
FO300025760	But, to the point: My task here is to collect the written works of those who came before in order to supplement the Brotherhood archives.
FO300025761	So, return here with any books that you find and I will reward you for them. With money. Because that's what you like.
FO300025762	Sorry, I'm too busy right now.
FO300025763	Very well. But, hear me out before you go. My task is to recover undamaged books in order to supplement the knowledge of the Citadel archives.
FO300025764	Should you come across any in your travels, return to me and I will reward you. And no questions will be asked about how you recovered them.
FO300025765	That is my proposal. Go now, and be strong. I shall remain here, should you be willing to help.
FO300025766	I'm interested in this. Tell me more.
FO300025767	Good. My task here is to collect the written works of those who came before in order to supplement the Brotherhood Archives at the Citadel.
FO300025768	I could have a million Initiates to comb the ruins, and I'd still never come close to recovering every book that remains undamaged.
FO300025769	Does it involve money? I really like money. Like, a lot.
FO300025770	I find that to be so with many Wastelanders. It may involve money, if you choose. Or there may be other forms of compensation.
FO300025771	But, before you receive any reward at all, you will have to be willing to aid me in my task here in this library.
FO300025772	Why should I tell you anything, lady?
FO300025773	Actually, it's "Scribe", not lady. Senior Scribe Yearling, Order of the Word.
FO300025774	And you should tell me what I want to know because I have a proposal and the considerable resources of the Brotherhood to compensate you.
FO300025775	I use what I can find, the same as anyone.
FO300025776	So it goes with all of us. Perhaps we can be of use to one another.
FO300025777	I am Senior Scribe Yearling, Order of the Word. I have a proposal for you if you are interested.
FO300025778	I guess I'll be going, then.
FO300025779	I can't go anywhere without bumping into you assholes.
FO300025780	I would be cautious about insulting the Brotherhood. We have very long memories. Very long.
FO300025781	Leave this library and do not return. We have work to do here and I have no time for ill-mannered Wastelanders. Go.
FO300025782	Whoa, calm down. I was just exploring this area.
FO300025783	You're awfully brave to be walking around down here by yourself. Are you scavenging the ruins?
FO300025784	What's happening here?
FO300025785	What does it look like? We're fighting a losing battle! That's what's happening.
FO300025786	They just keep coming. We haven't slept in days. Every couple of hours, more show up.
FO300025787	Is there anything going on here?
FO300025788	Some fellas came by here a while ago that said they was lookin' for some troublemaker that came from out of one of them Vaults.
FO300025789	I told 'em I ain't seen nobody like that and set 'em on their way.
FO300025790	They might still be around here though, if'n you think you can help 'em.
FO300025791	Some fellas came by here a while ago that said they was lookin' for some dogooder that came from out of one of them Vaults.
FO300025792	I told 'em I ain't seen nobody like that and set 'em on their way.
FO300025793	They might still be around here though, if'n you think you can help 'em.
FO300025794	Nope. Can't say that I heard anything but them 'Lurks in quite some time.
FO300025795	What are you doing way out here?
FO300025796	My boys are huntin' 'Lurks. Finest meat you can get, and it don't move around in your stomach like Mole Rat does.
FO300025797	Right dangerous, those things. Just as soon take your head off as look at'cha. Watch yourself out here. They're all over.
FO300025798	All right. I haven't killed anyone all day. Let's go.
FO300025799	That gun doesn't look loaded.
FO300025800	What? How did you know that?
FO300025801	I can't give you all my stuff, sorry.
FO300025802	Bullshit. A mugger in the Wasteland? A real Raider would've shot me already.
FO300025803	Alright. Alright. I wasn't going to shoot you. Damn gun's outta shells, anyway.
FO300025804	Look. This is embarrassing. I'm just going to go, okay?
FO300025805	How about I give you 5 caps and you leave me alone?
FO300025806	What? You don't have even have 5 caps! Stop jerking off and hand everything over.
FO300025807	Back off or I'll make you regret threatening me.
FO300025808	Hey, hey. I didn't mean anything by it. Just trying to get by out here in the Wastes, you know?
FO300025809	It won't happen again, uh, sir.
FO300025810	Hey, hey. I didn't mean anything by it. Just trying to get by out here in the Wastes, you know?
FO300025811	Holy shit! You're that guy from the radio!
FO300025812	Yup! Guilty as charged! He he.
FO300025813	I don't usually have exposure to the public like this. It's nice to know someone's listening.
FO300025814	Makes carrying on the Good Fight that much easier.
FO300025815	Time for a showdown with the remaining Enclave forces at the Jefferson Memorial? You keep listening, children, and GNR will keep you posted!
FO300025816	In other news, the Brotherhood of Steel has amassed a large assault force at the Citadel.
FO300025817	Can't have everything, I guess.
FO300025818	Now here's the bad news. Unfortunately, the little bitch from Vault 101 managed to crawl out before the place went kaboom.
FO300025819	Now here's the bad news. Unfortunately, the little prick from Vault 101 managed to crawl out before the place went kaboom.
FO300025820	Time for a showdown with the remaining Enclave forces at the Jefferson Memorial? You keep listening, children, and GNR will keep you posted!
FO300025821	In other news, the Brotherhood of Steel has amassed a large assault force at the Citadel.
FO300025822	Keep fighting the good fight, kid! We're with you all the way!
FO300025823	And if that weren't good enough news, word is our old friend from Vault 101 made it out of there in one piece.
FO300025824	Sure enough, the Enclave radio station is officially offline. Hell, check for yourself if you don't' believe me!
FO300025825	The Enclave's not-so-secret base way up in the northwest just went kablooey! And I have reports, damn good ones, that Eden didn't make it out alive!
FO300025826	I'm coming to you live with a special report! Ding, dong, the sanctimonious, self-righteous, self-proclaimed Presidential asshole is dead!
FO300025827	If Eden declares this kid vice president, I swear to God I'll swallow this microphone.
FO300025828	She was seen not too long ago walking away from the Enclave's not-so-secret base way out to the northwest.
FO300025829	He was seen not too long ago walking away from the Enclave's not-so-secret base way out to the northwest.
FO300025830	Well no such luck.
FO300025831	We haven't heard squat about the little bitch from Vault 101 for two weeks, and hoped to God someone finally put a bullet in her brain.
FO300025832	We haven't heard squat about the little prick from Vault 101 for two weeks, and hoped to God someone finally put a bullet in his brain.
FO300025833	I'm coming to you live with a special report!
FO300025834	Keep fighting the good fight, kid! We're with you all the way!
FO300025835	Well buck up, pilgrims! Our friend is alive and well, and has managed to slip through the Enclave's clutches and escape their fortified base!
FO300025836	We haven't heard squat about our old pal from Vault 101 for two weeks now, and it's been looking pretty grim.
FO300025837	I'm coming to you live with a special report!
FO300025838	Good luck, Wanderer. You'll need it.
FO300025839	Anyway, the vertibird was headed northwest into the mountains, where I have it on good authority the Enclave has their big underground clubhouse.
FO300025840	My deep cover super secret agents tell me a vertibird recently flew out of the mountains to the west, and the vault kid was an unwilling passenger.
FO300025841	Yikes. Looks like the lone Wanderer has wandered himself right into the Enclave's sinister clutches.
FO300025842	Yikes. Looks like the lone Wanderer has wandered herself right into the Enclave's sinister clutches.

FO300025844	So what was Vault kid doing out there? You do the math.
FO300025845	But Three Dog, the selling of live human beings is completely fucked up! Yes, children. Yes it is.
FO300025846	Do you know what goes on out there in the stripmall that time forgot? Wake up, children! It's a goddamned slaver compound! They. Sell. People.
FO300025847	The gal from Vault 101 was seen walking into Paradise Falls, and then walking back out with a big smile on her face.
FO300025848	The cat from Vault 101 was seen walking into Paradise Falls, and then walking back out with a big smile on his face.
FO300025849	Did they sell her a bum slave and then refuse the refund, or was it some elaborate rescue operation?
FO300025850	Did they sell him a bum slave and then refuse the refund, or was it some elaborate rescue operation?
FO300025851	You heard it here first, faithful listeners. The Wanderer showed up at slaver central and bad guys started dropping left and right.
FO300025852	Those scumbag Slavers way over in Paradise Falls had one big ole bee on their bonnet, and this baby knew how to sting.
FO300025853	Those scumbag Slavers way over in Paradise Falls have one big ole bee on their bonnet. Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
FO300025854	Good luck with that, my friend. Only thing been seen out in those parts is Yao Guai, Super Mutants, and some crazy mountain kids.
FO300025855	Makes perfect sense to me. The kid's had enough of the wild and wooly Wasteland, and is looking for another old vault to crawl into.
FO300025856	The kid from Vault 101, aka the Wanderer, aka "That Crazy Sonnuvabitch," has been spotted poking around some caves way out west.
FO300025857	They're safe and sound now at the Citadel. Praise Jesus! Praise Jesus! No sign of the kid's father, though. Here's hoping James is okay.
FO300025858	And, when the Man showed up, a bunch of scientists went running. With them was Rivet City's own Dr. Madison Li, and that crazy kid from Vault 101.
FO300025859	Tinfoil hat time, children. My eyes and ears tell me the Big Bad Government has taken over that big machine thingy at the Jefferson Memorial.
FO300025860	RadioGNRPlayerExploitsMQ04
FO300025861	Here's hoping they can hold onto each other this time around.
FO300025862	But none of that matters now! Father and daughter were spotted walkin' and talkin' together out there in the Wastes.
FO300025863	But none of that matters now! Father and son were spotted walkin' and talkin' together out there in the Wastes.
FO300025864	What kind of dad leaves his kid in an underground bunker? Children, I just don't know. It ain't for Three Dog to judge, and you shouldn't either.
FO300025865	You see, the kid from Vault 101 has been looking for her dad, a very nice man named James, who left his daughter in the vault when he took off.
FO300025866	You see, the kid from Vault 101 has been looking for his dad, a very nice man named James, who left his son behind in the vault when he took off.
FO300025867	Hey, all I can tell you is the Vault kid showed up, and the scientists there started running around like their pointy heads were on fire.
FO300025868	RadioGNRPlayerExploitsMQ02
FO300025869	Kid, you get your ass back to GNR, you hear me? We've got some stuff to talk about!
FO300025870	From here on in, it's bye-bye stupid static, hello magnificent music. So sit back, relax, and absorb these classic tunes.
FO300025871	Because of the kid from Vault 101, that's how! That gal actually managed to repair our antenna relay. How's that for ingenuity, folks?
FO300025872	Because of the kid from Vault 101, that's how! That cat actually managed to repair our antenna relay. How's that for ingenuity, folks?
FO300025873	But Three Dog! You're in that cool radio studio in D.C. How do YOU know I can hear you, all the way out here in the ass end of nowhere?
FO300025874	That's right, from Megaton to Girdershade, Paradise Falls to the Republic of Dave, we are coming to you loud and proud, in a special live report!
FO300025875	And for all you other cats out there listening, if you see the kid from Vault 101 out there, give her a pat on the back and wish her luck.
FO300025876	And for all you other cats out there listening, if you see the kid from Vault 101 out there, give him a pat on the back and wish him luck.
FO300025877	Is that why he left the vault? Looks that way. So who knows, maybe James is going to save the world. Can't think of a better cause than that.
FO300025878	See, James left Vault 101 without telling the kid why. Now, I've since learned that James is a scientist and is working on something big.
FO300025879	I know! I know! I couldn't make this shit up! Okay, but now it gets kind of sad. You see, the kid is looking for her dad, looking for James.
FO300025880	I know! I know! I couldn't make this shit up! Okay, but now it gets kind of sad. You see, the kid is looking for his dad, looking for James.
FO300025881	Now. You want to know if it gets better, don't you? Well hell YES it gets better! Turns out vault dweller #2 was none other than James's kid!
FO300025882	Okay, so I told you about James, the guy from the vault. And then I told you somebody else crawled outta there too. Right.
FO300025883	Hoooooo BOY! Children, you are going to LOVE this.
FO300025884	Look, I already know about my Dad, so this was all a waste of time.
FO300025885	Don't ever let anyone make you think that fighting the Good Fight is a waste of time!
FO300025886	Whether you like it or not, you just made a difference in the world.
FO300025887	It contains the location of an old weapons cache. You're welcome to help yourself to anything inside.
FO300025888	Yeah, I heard you found out about your Dad, and yet you went ahead and kept your promise to me. That takes some real moxie, kid.
FO300025889	Three Dog can't let you walk away from here empty-handed after all that.
FO300025890	It contains the location of an old weapons cache. You're welcome to help yourself to anything inside.
FO300025891	I guess this is goodbye then. It's been a pleasure, Three Dog.
FO300025892	Now hang on a second there. Three Dog can't let you walk away from here empty-handed like this.
FO300025893	I heard you found out about your Dad on your own, and yet you went ahead and kept your promise to me. That takes some real moxie, kid.

FO300025896	I'm afraid I haven't heard from Crow for a while, now. I'm afraid he may have fallen victim to foul play.
FO300025897	Let's talk about armor.
FO300025898	Our man Crow handles most armor and clothing out on the trail.
FO300025899	He grew up a tribal, but he traded in his loincloth for much snappier apparel long ago.
FO300025900	Let's talk about armor.

FO300025904	Lucky Harith kind of dropped off the map. Or, knowing his wares, he may have burnt a whole straight through it.
FO300025905	Let's talk about weapons.
FO300025906	Then you'd be looking for Lucky Harith, adventurer, martial artist, and occasional collector of the most deadly items known to mankind.
FO300025907	He's a bit of an eccentric, but he deals in more weaponry than you can shake a sharp stick at. In fact, he's probably got a sharp stick, too.
FO300025908	Let's talk about weapons.
FO300025909	What sort of death-dealing implements would you like to see from Harith?
FO300025910	Let's talk about weapons.
FO300025911	The good doctor's lab equipment isn't cheap. It'll cost about 200 caps for him to offer higher quality material.
FO300025912	He should expand his inventory.
FO300025913	At this point, it would be hard to improve Doc's medicine cabinet without a significant investment.
FO300025914	Say, 500 caps should suffice for him to offer a whole cornucopia of pharmacopoeia.
FO300025915	He should expand his inventory further.
FO300025916	He should expand his inventory.
FO300025917	I agree wholeheartedly. I'd hate to unduly burden a dedicated entrepreneur.
FO300025918	I suppose you're right. Best to let them stay independent.
FO300025919	My, my! When it comes to sales, I can see even I've got a few things I could learn from you!
FO300025920	Well, in that case, I can act as your representative to the caravans. They'll listen to me, and I'll listen to you.
FO300025921	Just let me know what you suggest in the way of specialties, and I'll let them know to focus on that area.
FO300025922	Under my organization, they'd see better profits and more bargaining power.
FO300025923	And I could act as their representative in this matter. Goodness knows, I've known them for years, so I should be able to speak for them.
FO300025924	Just let me know what you suggest in the way of specialties, and I'll let them know to focus on that area.
FO300025925	Working together would allow specialization in sales, for more reliable profits.
FO300025926	Madam, you flatter me! I'm but a humble man of this small community.
FO300025927	But, since it's a trader community, I suppose I can call in a few favors with the caravans. I suppose I am rather persuasive in that way.
FO300025928	So, you just let me know what you'd like to see from the caravans, and I'll let them know what to focus on.
FO300025929	Oh, I'm sure a charismatic fellow like you can get them to follow your lead.
FO300025930	I suppose I can call in a few favors with the caravans, talk with them about their inventory. Must keep the customers happy, right?
FO300025931	So, you just let me know what you'd like to see from the caravans, and I'll let them know what to focus on.
FO300025932	Maybe, but if they were more closely organized, the costs of organization might outweigh the benefits.
FO300025933	The economics of this sort of trading operation can be rather more complex than your standard store in a settlement, sadly.
FO300025934	Couldn't they make more money if they worked together?
FO300025935	It'd take a pretty savvy businessman to make it worth their while to work together. Frankly, I'm not sure even I'm up to the task!
FO300025936	Have you thought about organizing the traders into a unified group?
FO300025937	Sure thing! Which one would you like to talk about?

FO300025955	Well, there's always tomorrow, isn't there? At least, one hopes, eh? Ha!
FO300025956	CCMentor1
FO300025957	It was okay.
FO300025958	I suppose it was fine.
FO300025959	Thanks!
FO300025960	It wasn't anything much. But thanks!
FO300025961	CCTrade
FO300025962	You can usually find one of the trade caravans at the entrance to town. They come through every day or two.
FO300025963	Other than them, Porter's always got food for sale down at the diner.
FO300025964	Anything to trade around here?
FO300025965	Take a look, let me know what you want.
FO300025966	What's on the menu?
FO300025967	What's on the menu?
FO300025968	Tell me what you need, and maybe I've got your fix.
FO300025969	I'm here to buy.
FO300025970	Let's see what the good doctor has in his magic bag, shall we?
FO300025971	I'm here to buy.
FO300025972	Nothing but the highest quality leftovers, junk, and crap!
FO300025973	I'm here to buy.
FO300025974	Crazy Wolfgang's got just what you need! Assuming you need the random junk that I've got.
FO300025975	I'm here to buy.
FO300025976	I'm here to buy.
FO300025977	Please, enjoy my selection of high-quality problem-solvers!
FO300025978	I'm here to buy.
FO300025979	Have a look, see if anything calls out to you.
FO300025980	I'm here to buy.
FO300025981	If the clothes make the man, then here are the means to re-make yourself.
FO300025982	I'm here to buy.
FO300025983	They're just small caravans that make rounds through the Wastes, hawking their wares from Paradise Falls to Rivet City.
FO300025984	They won't trade with anyone who's hit their friends, but that's about as organized as they get.
FO300025985	How organized are the traders?
FO300025986	Quite organized, now. Thanks to your guidance, of course! They still travel independently, but I keep track of their investments and such.
FO300025987	They make more profits, and supplies get to those that need them most, so everyone wins. Such is the magic of economics!
FO300025988	How organized are the traders?
FO300025989	If you're done asking questions, I'm sure there's something I should be keeping an eye on.
FO300025990	Okay, that's enough.
FO300025991	I'm about the rarest thing out here in the Wastes: a mercenary who lived long enough to retire.
FO300025992	I used to sell my services around here, so it was a natural place to settle down. Not a bad sort of retirement, honestly.
FO300025993	How did you get this position?
FO300025994	Because I asked them to, I suspect. I grew up in these trade caravans; known most of them my whole life.
FO300025995	I founded this place with my sister Daisy, back in the day. Perfect stop along the caravan circuit.
FO300025996	Why do the traders come here?
FO300025997	Life and death matters, putting down thieves, protecting people from raiders who are shortsighted or stupid enough to attack, that sort of thing.
FO300025998	Pretty much, anything the man can't solve by talking at it. And don't misunderstand, he can solve a lot of things that way.
FO300025999	What do you mean, "the big stuff"?
FO300026000	What can you tell me about Canterbury Commons?
FO300026001	Hah! Damn near everything, I suspect! I founded the place myself, and I'm the reason this place stays fat and happy.
FO300026002	It's okay, I guess. I heard it's safer than most places, because the raiders don't bother us. But I've never been anywhere else, so I don't know.
FO300026003	Best place I ever worked in, and I guess I've worked about everywhere there is.
FO300026004	We get some weird types passing through, but it's stable enough for a guy to make an honest living. I don't really see what more a man could ask for.
FO300026005	Canterbury's a good town. Roe's done a damned good job setting up the place, and no one can handle the day-to-day details like him.
FO300026006	But when it comes to the big stuff, that's when he needs a little help. That's where I come in.
FO300026007	This whole place would fall apart if it weren't for Dom and me keeping anyone from causing too much trouble.
FO300026008	Fat, old Roe may think he runs the place, but it's only because Dom lets the idiot.
FO300026009	Well, hope you had fun with that.
FO300026010	Because I wanted to talk to the world's biggest pain in the ass, apparently.
FO300026011	Well, if you figure it out, be sure to let me know, okay? I'm kind of busy.
FO300026012	Now that I think about it, I'm not really sure.
FO300026013	I guess, sure. I'll keep an eye out for any hidden depths, okay?
FO300026014	Sometimes people can have hidden depths even they don't know about.
FO300026015	CCFirstMeeting1C
FO300026016	In that case, perhaps you ought to leave town, stranger.
FO300026017	That'd save Dom the cost of ammo, and it'd save you the cost of being dead. Now, good day.
FO300026018	My business and pleasure are the same. And you're not going to like either.
FO300026019	In that case, I'm sure you'll find it was providence that brought you here!
FO300026020	Why, have a talk with any trader in town, and I'm sure you'll find just the thing you didn't even realize you needed!
FO300026021	Neither. Just wandering through, Roe.
FO300026022	Huh. Why'd you want to do that?
FO300026023	I already talked to your uncle. I figured I'd talk to you, too.
FO300026024	Sure, fine, whatever.
FO300026025	Then why am I wasting my time talking to you? Scram.
FO300026026	Sorry, but our water purifier's been on backorder for about two hundred years.
FO300026027	Unless you're here to make the delivery, I suggest you be glad for what you've got.
FO300026028	Unpurified water? I'm insulted.
FO300026029	Sure, you do that. We can take turns shooting each other, teams are "the whole damned town" versus "your face." Our team's got a winning record.
FO300026030	Now, if we're done with this little pissing contest, I've got to get back to work. But I can tell we're just going to be best friends forever.
FO300026031	Maybe I can introduce a new pastime: shooting nosy guards in the face.
FO300026032	And it sounds like your tongue's going to get itself cut out if you keep bothering me, man. Get lost.
FO300026033	Watch your attitude. It'll get you in trouble.
FO300026034	Yeah, maybe. But you need one to keep some of those caravaners in line. And to keep them from getting too friendly, if you catch my drift.
FO300026035	Even in a nice place like this, a girl's best friend is a good knife, right?
FO300026036	Watch your attitude. It'll get you in trouble.
FO300026037	Most of the caravans that come through, their fondest desire is to spend a few days off the road and to get a full stomach.
FO300026038	We've got good food in the diner, and we try to keep it nice and peaceful here. When that's an option, of course.
FO300026039	Pleasure's hard to come by out here. What's on tap?
FO300026040	First clue was that you didn't shoot me. Most troublemakers I meet are just starving folks down on their luck. So, stop the starve, stop the trouble.
FO300026041	I can save a whole lot of trouble that way. Plus, if you're still planning on raising hell, losing out on a drink is the last of my worries!
FO300026042	Pretty trusting of you. How do you know I'm not here to cause trouble?
FO300026043	Sorry. I mean, I'm Derek. Welcome to Canterbury, Miss. Commons. Canterbury Commons. Miss.
FO300026044	Calm down, kid. Can you actually say a whole sentence at once?
FO300026045	When I can find time for it, sure. In the guarding business, it's the personal touches that make all the difference.
FO300026046	Anyway, welcome to town, don't cause trouble, threats of violent justice, so on, so forth. You look like you know the drill.
FO300026047	Do you personally threaten every visitor to your town?
FO300026048	This is Canterbury Commons, where dirty, old lechers get rid of everything they picked up on the road. Unless it's not treatable, that is.
FO300026049	I'm new in town. What is this place?
FO300026050	Understood, understood. A man doesn't get to be my age without learning when not to pry.
FO300026051	Business. My business. So mind your own.
FO300026052	Damn near all of 'em, depending on which caravan's in town! Guns, armor, food, junk, pretty much everyone swings by the old circle, eventually.
FO300026053	Everyone but Slavers, that is. It's a hassle to transport their wares, as they say. Just as well, eh? Anything else I can do to welcome you to town?
FO300026054	I'm all business. What types have you got to offer?
FO300026055	Sounds like you've never spent a day mucking out Brahmin pens with a busted shovel.
FO300026056	My uncle says it'll build character. Mostly, it just builds stink.
FO300026057	Don't sell yourself short. Even the little jobs can be important.
FO300026058	We do our best. Well, Dom and Roe do their best. I just make sure they've got enough food so they can keep on doing their best.
FO300026059	You ever find yourself starving around here, drop by Dot's Diner. We don't charge much, but don't expect any more freebies.
FO300026060	Thanks, Joe. Looks like a pretty nice place, here.
FO300026061	Sounds like a good plan. Keeps the traders happy, that way. And it means Machete and I get to save on ammo.
FO300026062	No worries. I wasn't planning on stealing anything.
FO300026063	Fine, hi, whatever. I'm Machete, and I've got better things to do than talk with you. Scram.
FO300026064	I didn't mean to interrupt. I just wanted to say hi.
FO300026065	I'm not interested in fixing things right now.
FO300026066	Yeah, no problem. Come back if you decide to help.
FO300026067	It's probably just a problem in a subroutine somewhere. No sweat.
FO300026068	Great. Just between us mechanics, try some Mentats before you tackle that robot. They really clear your head.
FO300026069	I know they're addictive, but hey, that's just the sort of risk professionals like us take, right? Here, I've got a few.
FO300026070	Huh. A robot stuck in a diagnostic loop. Curious.
FO300026071	Hey, you really know robots, huh? Great to meet another mechanic.
FO300026072	I stumbled across this model a while ago. I just can't seem to fix it.
FO300026073	Well, I'm not gonna stay here and listen to your bullying. Forget it.
FO300026074	I'm outta here. Good luck with that robot. Jackass.
FO300026075	What will you give me if I fix it?
FO300026076	I could give you some old energy cells I have. They might be worth a few caps at the nearest town.
FO300026077	I could try to fix that robot for you.
FO300026078	Thanks! If you get it working, I have a couple of energy cells you can have. Just come back to me when you're done.
FO300026079	I guess that robot doesn't like your house. I agree: the architecture sucks.
FO300026080	Huh, what? Oh, yeah. That's funny.
FO300026081	This robot is stuck in some sort of loop. It's been prattling about houses and supplies for an hour.
FO300026082	I've given up on trying to fix it.
FO300026083	Something wrong with your robot?
FO300026084	I've been wondering about that for an hour, now.
FO300026085	I think it's stuck in some sort of loop. I tried fixing it, but all those switches and circuits are beyond me.
FO300026086	Yeah. I'm about ready to smash the damn thing and move on.
FO300026087	Robot's still broken, huh?
FO300026088	FFEU10RobotTalk1
FO300026089	I give up. You're not getting any more fixed with me just talking to you.
FO300026090	There's no sense in trying to fix this heap of junk. Dammit.
FO300026091	I just have no idea what to do with you.
FO300026092	You're not inside a house, robot. Why do you think you are?
FO300026093	There's nothing wrong with the outside of you. Something wrong with the inside, then?
FO300026094	The dog is dead. Please go to the pound to obtain a new one.
FO300026095	Lawnmower in need of maintenance. Please repair to keep grass freshly cut.
FO300026096	Out of dog food for animal, designation "Fluffy." Please purchase more food to ensure optimal health.
FO300026097	House is gone. Please contact your local planning authority to construct a new residence.
FO300026098	Current paperwork on residence now 220 years out of date. Please contact local planning authorities to obtain new paperwork.
FO300026099	No furniture detected in current residence. Please visit your local shopping area to make appropriate purchases.
FO300026100	Wouldn't a beacon just attract the Slavers?
FO300026101	You make jokes when the lives and freedom of our fellow men are at stake!
FO300026102	I tell you, I know a place that we can defend from the slavers.
FO300026103	Why don't you just kill them and take all their stuff? Everyone else does.
FO300026104	They come here with nothing but their dignity. Would you have me take that from them too?
FO300026105	We will rise above our base instincts and help our fellow man.
FO300026106	That's a really stupid idea.
FO300026107	You wouldn't say that if you spent even a single night in shackles.
FO300026108	I'm done trying to justify my plan to you. If you don't want to help us, just say so.
FO300026109	So, you used to be a slave?
FO300026110	Long time ago. Eight years I think.
FO300026111	Three of us escaped during the night. They caught Liesel and John. I made it into the wasteland.
FO300026112	Raiders took me in at first. When I heard about this place, I knew I had to come here.
FO300026113	Oh, yes. All my life.
FO300026114	One day I killed the master's little girl. It was an accident, I swear!
FO300026115	Hannibal found me. I would never have made it without him.
FO300026116	Not for long. Me and my merc crew were captured by slavers.
FO300026117	Seven months I groveled and obeyed like a good lap dog. When I saw my chance, I took it.
FO300026118	I had nowhere else to go. Hannibal took me in. He never cared about my past.
FO300026119	Yes. For four years. I was young and pretty. I don't need to tell you what my duties were.
FO300026120	He liked me enough to educate me. I learned reading, history, math, and even some science.
FO300026121	When my master married, his wife insisted I get sold. Hannibal bought me and freed me.
FO300026122	For 23 years I was a slave, ever since I was 14.
FO300026123	Six years ago I managed to escape from my master. He's been hunting me ever since.
FO300026124	When I found the head of Lincoln here, I knew it was a sign for me to help other slaves to escape.
FO300026125	I founded the Temple of the Union as a safe haven for runaway slaves everywhere.
FO300026126	What's the story with Hannibal?
FO300026127	You've got to make up your own mind, sir.
FO300026128	This is a good place. A safe place.
FO300026129	Hannibal wants me to promise to keep this place safe. Why should I do that?
FO300026130	He's gonna save us all.
FO300026131	I mean all us slaves. He's gonna find a way to free everyone one of us.
FO300026132	Because if you don't, I get to use you for target practice.
FO300026133	Why should I promise to protect this place?
FO300026134	Why are you asking?
FO300026135	He's the one honest, decent man in the Wasteland.
FO300026136	You hurt him and I'll hunt you down and feed you your own liver.
FO300026137	So what can you tell me about Hannibal Hamlin?
FO300026138	We keep the dream alive. The dream of a free world where all men are created equal.
FO300026139	Hannibal has plans to abolish slavery everywhere. What more noble goal is there?
FO300026140	Why do you think I should swear my allegiance to this place?
FO300026141	He's a man with a dream.
FO300026142	If you want to know more than that, you should ask him, not me.
FO300026143	I trust him with my life, but you'll have to make up your own mind.
FO300026144	Who is this Hannibal guy, anyway?
FO300026145	Somebody's got to look out for those that can't look out for themselves.
FO300026146	That's all Hannibal is trying to do. He's looking out for all those runaway slaves.
FO300026147	I'm supposed to promise to keep this place safe. Why should I?
FO300026148	He's got big plans.
FO300026149	Someday we're going to leave this place and make our own town.
FO300026150	I hope I get to help build it.
FO300026151	What do you do here?
FO300026152	My former master trained me in masonry. I fix things.
FO300026153	Someday I hope to reattach Lincoln's head to the statue in the Memorial.
FO300026154	I'm an historian. I also tinker with pre-war machines.
FO300026155	My dream is to build a shrine to the great Abraham Lincoln.
FO300026156	I shoot nosy people.
FO300026157	What the hell do you think I do? I protect this place.
FO300026158	A bit of this and a bit of that. Whatever Mister Hannibal needs.
FO300026159	I look after the animals, cook our meals, clean up, things like that.
FO300026160	If I had known this before, I wouldn't have come in. Let me go!
FO300026161	We can't risk that. Just as we couldn't risk telling you who we were before letting you in.
FO300026162	All I need is your word. Will you guard our secret?
FO300026163	I'm an escaped slave. I was told you help runaways like me. <Lie.>
FO300026164	You're the best equipped runaway slave I've ever seen.
FO300026165	Whether you're telling the truth or lying through your teeth, you'll need to see Hannibal.
FO300026166	Keep your hands in sight and don't make any sudden moves. I'm coming down to open the gate.
FO300026167	I want to know what you're hiding in there. Now open the damn door.
FO300026168	That's some tough talk stranger. You should clear out of here before I'm forced to make you.
FO300026169	Forget it. I'm not interested.
FO300026170	Suit yourself. Offer's here if you want it.
FO300026171	Sounds like a deal.
FO300026172	Alright. Fix that robot, and I'll give you some energy cells. Good luck.
FO300026173	That's a complicated job. I'm going to need some money.
FO300026174	Well, I guess that's fair. I'll throw in 100 caps if you fix the robot, plus the two energy cells.
FO300026175	RadioGNRPlayerExploitsMS16
FO300026176	Who says you can't go home again, huh? The kid from Vault 101 did, but it looks like the prodigal daughter's return didn't last all that long.
FO300026177	Who says you can't go home again, huh? The kid from Vault 101 did, but it looks like the prodigal son's return didn't last all that long.
FO300026178	Only you, 101. Only you.
FO300026179	You heard it here first, children. A forest fire in the Capital Wasteland, where all the trees were ALREADY burnt to a crisp 200 years ago.
FO300026180	Point 1: The kid from Vault 101 was seen in that area just before the fire.
FO300026181	Yeah, yeah. So what? Well here’s what.
FO300026182	We’ve been getting reports of a raging, sustained fire somewhere up north.
FO300026183	So what happened down there in the stinking, slinking subway tunnels? Friendly chit-chat, or a classic case of shotgun diplomacy?
FO300026184	The cherry on top? She emerged a short time later with a lad named Ian West, who, presumably, had been taken captive in the latest raid.
FO300026185	The cherry on top? He emerged a short time later with a lad named Ian West, who, presumably, had been taken captive in the latest raid.
FO300026186	Little Miss Vault 101 was spotted over in Arefu, where the settlement has been hit pretty hard lately by a marauding gang of riotous ruffians.
FO300026187	Mister Vault 101 was spotted over in Arefu, where the settlement has been hit pretty hard lately by a marauding gang of riotous ruffians.
FO300026188	RadioGNRPlayerExploitsMS08
FO300026189	A case of unrequited middle-aged romance, or some kind of spontaneously beneficial business arrangement?
FO300026190	Looks like Rivet City's latest visitor, a certain Zimmer from the scientifically superior Commonwealth, has finally packed his bags and headed home.
FO300026191	Could this have something to do with Miss Vault 101 playing junior gumshoe lately, interrogating everyone about a fugitive from the Commonwealth?
FO300026192	Could this have something to do with Mister Vault 101 playing junior gumshoe lately, interrogating everyone about a fugitive from the Commonwealth?
FO300026193	Trouble, oh we got trouble, right here in Rivet City! Looks like trusted resident and head of security Harkness has unexpectedly flown the coop.
FO300026194	RadioGNRPlayerExploitsMS06
FO300026195	One small step backwards for man, one giant evolutionary rewind for mankind.
FO300026196	You see, they worked together to completely wipe out a group of noble, slavery-hating abolitionists at a place called the Temple of the Union.
FO300026197	Well you're in luck! Human bondage is here to stay, folks, thanks to that asshole from Vault 101 and his Slaver amigos.
FO300026198	Are you sick enough to think slavery is the best thing to happen to the Capital Wasteland since broiled Mirelurk Cakes?
FO300026199	Are you a worthless piece of human trash who'd like nothing better than to own another human being?
FO300026200	Thanks to the kid from Vault 101, for assisting with this little bit of civic restoration.
FO300026201	Slavers of the Capital Wasteland, consider this the big "fuck you" you've had coming since starting this scurrilous skin trade.
FO300026202	So if you're a slave on the run, the time for lying low is long gone. Head to the Temple of the Union and keep your head held high.
FO300026203	Is the tide finally turning for those scumbag Slavers? Lordy knows it's been open season on defenseless settlers long enough.
FO300026204	Looks like our friend from Vault 101 has turned amateur abolitionist, lending a hand to the folks at the Temple of the Union.
FO300026205	RadioGNRPlayerExploitsMS05
FO300026206	I've also heard it tastes like Radscorpion shit and turns your piss blue. Or does it taste like Radscorpion piss and turn your shit blue? Whatever.
FO300026207	It's called Nuka-Cola Quantum, and I believe it was made in limited quantities before the war.
FO300026208	God knows why, but the kid from Vault 101 is scouring the Capital Wasteland for a unique brand of Nuka-Cola.
FO300026209	Oh, you heard me right! 101, a little defenseless boy begged you for help, and what did you do? You SOLD HIM AS A FUCKING SLAVE!
FO300026210	I'll tell you where Bryan Wilks is. He's at fucking Paradise Falls, that's where!
FO300026211	So if you see Bryan and his new parents, wish them all good luck. Oh, and 101? Nice work.
FO300026212	You see, not only did Miss Vault 101 stop the Ant problem, she also found little Bryan Wilks a new home.
FO300026213	You see, not only did Mister Vault 101 stop the Ant problem, he also found little Bryan Wilks a new home.
FO300026214	Bryan, sadly, was the sole survivor. That's where the kid from Vault 101 comes in, and where our story, thankfully, gets better.
FO300026215	So for the love of God, if someone is in the vicinity of Grayditch, could you please give the kid a Nuka-Cola, a Salisbury steak, something?
FO300026216	Good God, 101, have you no conscience? You left the kid to rot in that fallout shelter. I have witnesses!
FO300026217	I'll tell you where Bryan Wilks is. That little boy is stuck in a fucking box, that's where!
FO300026218	But, what did she do with the boy, Three Dog? Where's Bryan Wilks now?
FO300026219	But, what did he do with the boy, Three Dog? Where's Bryan Wilks now?
FO300026220	Bryan, sadly, was the sole survivor. That's where the kid from Vault 101 comes in, and where our story, unfortunately, gets even worse.
FO300026221	You see, Bryan's from Grayditch, a small settlement that was recently overrun with overzealous Giant Ants.
FO300026222	Following this thing's advice'll get you killed faster than you can say, "Hug a deathclaw!"
FO300026223	The kid from Vault 101 had a big hand in getting this thing written, and her research methods suck. There, I said it.
FO300026224	The kid from Vault 101 had a big hand in getting this thing written, and his research methods suck. There, I said it.
FO300026225	Public Service Warning, children! Watch out for a book claiming to be a "Wasteland Survival Guide!"
FO300026226	Survive, Thrive, and Revive, that's the name of the game. The book is the Wasteland Survival Guide! Pick up your copy today!
FO300026227	Now, let me tell ya. This thing's got all sorts of useful tips. Where to find food, how to deal with radiation, tons o' stuff.
FO300026228	Our first masterpiece is called "The Wasteland Survival Guide," written by Underworld's own Moira Brown.
FO300026229	Our first masterpiece is called "The Wasteland Survival Guide," written by Megaton's own Moira Brown.
FO300026230	In any event, the super silly situation's been dealt with, Canterbury Commons is safe, and 101 is the woman of the hour.
FO300026231	In any event, the super silly situation's been dealt with, Canterbury Commons is safe, and 101 is the man of the hour.
FO300026232	A big 'thank you' goes out to the mysterious traveler from Vault 101, for saving the little town of Canterbury Commons.
FO300026233	Looks like I've got a spot o' good news for you, children.
FO300026234	RadioGNRPlayerExploitsMS01
FO300026235	Somethin' about a rescue from Super Mutants, if you can believe that. Nice going, kid.
FO300026236	Now, I've got new reports from the settlement known as Bigtown that Little Miss Vault Gal has helped them out with one hell of a mess.
FO300026237	Now, I've got new reports from the settlement known as Bigtown that Mister Vault Guy has helped them out with one hell of a mess.
FO300026238	What will you do now?
FO300026239	I'll mourn Him with every ounce of my being. This has been a tremendous loss to the world.
FO300026240	If anything, this place will become a memorial to Him lest we may forget.
FO300026241	Rejoice in the knowledge that one day all the barren rock and sand of this dead Wasteland will become vibrant with green once again!
FO300026242	There's so much to prepare for, so much to do!
FO300026243	I'll remain hopeful that someday Birch will come to his senses and realize we may not only be the only Treeminders, but the last of them as well.
FO300026244	I will do my best to honor the Great One's memory by tending this place until my dying day.
FO300026245	If anything, this place will become a memorial to Him lest we may forget.
FO300026246	Although his influence will spread through the Wasteland one day, that day is still a long way off.
FO300026247	For now, we'll remain ever vigilant and watch the Wasteland for anything that could threaten this sanctuary.
FO300026248	Now that Oasis is safe, we do what we always do. We remain ever vigilant and watch the Wasteland for anything that could threaten this sanctuary.
FO300026249	Now that Harold's gone, I lost my bestest friend! All I want to do is cry!
FO300026250	I dunno, maybe go play with Harold? I wanna hear another one of his super swell stories!
FO300026251	Look to the future and seek the true meaning of what transpired here. If there's an answer out there somewhere, I'll find it.
FO300026252	I'll do what I do best. I'll make sure Oasis never falls even if it means my own death.
FO300026253	Whatever the Tree Father or Leaf Mother would have me do, I'm still theirs to obey.
FO300026254	I'll remain here and help in anyway that I can. I owe them my life, and I intend to repay that debt until my last breath.
FO300026255	What do you see in my future?
FO300026256	I see four-leaf clovers in the sky with time as their deadliest adversary.
FO300026257	I see a woman searching in vain for a relative long lost.
FO300026258	I feel the torment of a man who returns home and discovers the changes his absence has wrought.
FO300026259	I divine a great document and the passages that changed the face of the world.
FO300026260	I see four headless men and a being robbed of its dignity.
FO300026261	I picture a place of great sorrow where men are traded for money and treated like Brahmin.
FO300026262	I see a selfish man who lives among the clouds playing a dangerous game with the lives of those below him.
FO300026263	I see a mysterious man and a town on the brink of destruction.
FO300026264	I divine a group of individuals who society views as monsters and a town suspended above the ground.
FO300026265	I feel people's hatred and love for a man who hunts men that aren't men.
FO300026266	I see a great leader whose message carries through time as a rallying cry to the oppressed and a warning to the oppressors.
FO300026267	I hear the cry of a woman obsessed and the man who desires her.
FO300026268	I discern a lonely child trapped in a city on fire.
FO300026269	I divine an endless search for knowledge to help others survive the desolation.
FO300026270	I see a clash between insects and industry and the men that control them.
FO300026271	I see a town in need of a savior and a woman in red.
FO300026272	Tree Father Birch said you may have a gift for me?
FO300026273	I somehow knew you'd be the one to make the changes that Leaf Mother Laurel desired.
FO300026274	I helped to create the hoods that you see all Treeminders wear. It's said that the cloth has a part of the Great One's spirit woven into the fibers.
FO300026275	I present this to you as thanks. Wear this with pride and bring the message of renewal to all the corners of the Wasteland.
FO300026276	Leaf Mother Laurel said you may have a gift for me?
FO300026277	I helped to create the garb that you see all Treeminders wear. It's said that the cloth has a part of the Great One's spirit woven into the fibers.
FO300026278	I present this to you as thanks. Wear this with pride but tell no one where it came from or Oasis may face as yet a greater peril.
FO300026279	We're very much alike, you and I. We both searched the Wasteland seeking answers, but I found my answer here.
FO300026280	Here, please take this relic of my older days. Perhaps it will help you on your journey.
FO300026281	I've never known someone to show as much caring as you did towards us. It seems to be rare to run into anyone like that anymore.
FO300026282	That's partly why I never returned to my former life after I found myself in this place.
FO300026283	Allow me to present a piece of my past to you, friend. Perhaps it will serve you better than it served me.
FO300026284	Leaf Mother Laurel said you may have a gift for me?
FO300026285	I was gonna give this to my bestest friend Harold, but he doesn't have pockets, the silly-head!
FO300026286	This is a charm that my parents gave me for my fifth birthday. It's really neat! Take it!
FO300026287	I hear you may have a gift for me?
FO300026288	Yes, I believe Branchtender Linden, Bloomseer Poplar and my little Yew mentioned they had some things for you as gifts.
FO300026289	Such is our tradition when honored guests are preparing to leave.
FO300026290	You said someone had gifts for me?
FO300026291	Yes, I believe Branchtender Linden and Bloomseer Poplar mentioned they had some things for you as gifts.
FO300026292	Such is our tradition when honored guests are preparing to leave.
FO300026293	You said someone had gifts for me?
FO300026294	Yes, I believe Branchtender Maple, Branchtender Cypress and my little Yew mentioned they had some things for you as gifts.
FO300026295	Such is our tradition when honored guests are preparing to leave.
FO300026296	You said someone had gifts for me?
FO300026297	Yes, I believe Branchtender Maple and Branchtender Cypress mentioned they had some things for you as gifts.
FO300026298	Such is our tradition when honored guests are preparing to leave.
FO300026299	You said someone had gifts for me?
FO300026300	I can't explain it, but I can feel this place just teeming with life.
FO300026301	That's His power you feel, Outsider. With His outstretched limbs He shelters us and keep us safe.
FO300026302	He's no mere god, my friend.
FO300026303	He is the One Who Grows, He is the One Who Gives and He is the One Who Guides.
FO300026304	Thanks to Him, the Treeminders have a home.
FO300026305	Amazing, this place seems so abundant with animal life.
FO300026306	The innocent creatures are drawn here by His gifts. They come from across the Wasteland to live in this sanctuary.
FO300026307	This part of the world is healing, my friend, and it's all thanks to Him.
FO300026308	Your robot made this satisfying grinding noise when I ripped out its innards.
FO300026309	What the hell, man? Why would you even do that?
FO300026310	Forget you. I'm outta here. Stay away from machines in the future, especially mine.
FO300026311	I had to disable that robot. It was going to explode. <Lie.>
FO300026312	It was? I had no idea, thanks.
FO300026313	Here, take these for helping me out.
FO300026314	It was? I had no idea, thanks.
FO300026315	Here, take these for helping me out.
FO300026316	Your robot's working fine, now.
FO300026317	Thanks. Nice to meet a fellow mechanic out here in the Wasteland. Here's your payment.
FO300026318	Thanks. Nice to meet a fellow mechanic out here in the Wasteland. Here's your payment.
FO300026319	CG02TunnelSnakeTalkReply
FO300026320	Oh, I like that, Butch.
FO300026321	That's a good one. Best yet, don't you think, Wally?
FO300026322	Uh, sure. I mean, I really like that one!
FO300026323	I don't know. Maybe.
FO300026324	CG02TunnelSnakeTalkGeneral
FO300026325	Hey, how about the Vault Dwellers? Get it?
FO300026326	Yeah. I got one. "The Mackers." Super cool, right?
FO300026327	I don't know. You guys never like any of my ideas anyway.
FO300026328	If you're so smart, why don't you suggest something.
FO300026329	CG02TunnelSnakeTalk5
FO300026330	Oh! Oh! I got it. Oh, man this is a great one. "The Grease Weasels"! What do you guys think?
FO300026331	Didn't you guys like Grease Weasels?
FO300026332	CG02TunnelSnakeTalk4
FO300026333	How about "Hell's Overseers"? Yeah, I like that.
FO300026334	I can't believe you didn't like "Hell's Overseers". Better than anything you guys have come up with.
FO300026335	CG02TunnelSnakeTalk3
FO300026336	Isn't being a gang a little stupid? I mean, basically everyone we know is going to be in it.
FO300026337	CG02TunnelSnakeTalk2
FO300026338	I still like "The Mackers."
FO300026339	CG02TunnelSnakeTalk
FO300026340	MS17FinViolinMusic
FO300026341	So they killed Jonas, and I'm next, is that it?
FO300026342	Yeah. It's lucky I got here ahead of them. But we can't stand here talking! You've got to get out of here!
FO300026343	Good guess! I was the toughest defender they ever saw in Lamplight. I earned my nickname fighting off a Mole Rat with a knife big as my arm.
FO300026344	When I left, I figured I'd pass on a cushy place like Big Town. I ended up here, Dom took me on as a guard, and that's that.
FO300026345	Did you get your nickname in Lamplight?
FO300026346	That's all I need to know.
FO300026347	Enjoy!
FO300026348	See you 'round.
FO300026349	Stay out of trouble.
FO300026350	Where do the caravans set up?
FO300026351	When they're in town, you can find the caravan trader out front of the town.
FO300026352	They say it's a good way to catch a visitor's eye.
FO300026353	They usually sell their stuff out front of the town. Never seem to stick around for long, though.
FO300026354	I swear, those boys can't tolerate staying in one place for too long.
FO300026355	You can find them out front. If you didn't see them coming in, that probably means they're all out on trips.
FO300026356	If you're not in a hurry, you can wait a day or two. They'll be back around in time.
FO300026357	Where can I get some food?
FO300026358	You'll want to talk with Joe Porter, over in Dot's Diner.
FO300026359	I don't know who Dot was, but I'm sure Porter's food does her memory proud!
FO300026360	You certainly came to the right person. What'd you like?
FO300026361	Go talk with Porter, over in the Diner. He'll set you right for food.
FO300026362	Can I get some directions around town?
FO300026363	Glad to help, glad to help!
FO300026364	Uncle Roe and I live in the old town hall, and Mr. Porter runs the diner across the street. It's not really a big place, you know?
FO300026365	Sure thing. Where ya headed?
FO300026366	No problem. What're you looking for?
FO300026367	Busy. Go ask someone else.
FO300026368	I think it's time you put an end to this, once and for all.
FO300026369	New course of action dictated. Self-destruct sequence initialized.
FO300026370	Civilian is advised to secure hazardous FEV material to prevent explosive decompression.
FO300026371	Civilian also advised to evacuate complex immediately.
FO300026372	Shut yourself down. Shut down this whole place.
FO300026373	New directive accepted. Self-destruct sequence initialized. Civilian is advised to remove hazardous FEV material and exit at once.
FO300026374	Where are the other Tenpenny Tower residents?
FO300026375	Where are the other Tenpenny Tower residents?
FO300026376	So you approve of mass murder? The basement storage room is full of corpses.
FO300026377	Heh. Roy decided to take out the trash. I'm glad I lost my sense of smell. You'll want to stay clear of the basement storage room.
FO300026378	What happened to the other Tenpenny Tower residents?
FO300026379	Can't say I completely agreed with Roy's decision. Then again, they were a bunch of assholes. No one's innocent, kid. You'd do well to remember that.
FO300026380	The basement storage room is full of bodies. You have anything to do with that?
FO300026381	Let's just say those two-faced smoothskins didn't like the new management. So they all got themselves "evicted." Can't say it's a shame.
FO300026382	I notice a distinct lack of non-Ghoul tenants.
FO300026383	They had it coming. But I don't have to justify myself to you, or any other smoothskin. In fact, you'd best piss off if you don't want to join them.
FO300026384	Nice pile of bodies in the storage room. You're proud of yourself, aren't you?
FO300026385	What happened to Mister Tenpenny?
FO300026386	I'm afraid Tenpenny and I had little disagreement. Not to worry though. He soon had a little "accident." Problem solved.
FO300026387	Never mind.
FO300026388	Will you stop wasting my time?
FO300026389	You've got yourself a deal. Here's your 200 caps.
FO300026390	10 more batteries. Don't waste them, these things don't grow on trees you know.
FO300026391	Dumbass. You did waste them, didn't you?
FO300026392	200 caps? Wow. I'll have to get back to you on that.
FO300026393	I need to buy some more ammo for the Mesmetron.
FO300026394	You wasted everything I gave you already? Jesus. Whatever. I'll sell you 10 more for 200 caps. Take it or leave it.
FO300026395	Suit yourself. Not like it's coming out of my paycheck. I'll sell you 10 for 200 caps. Take it or leave it.
FO300026396	Hey, anything for some extra caps.
FO300026397	Excellent! Take this sniper rifle. You'll need it.
FO300026398	Here's a list of the guys and their last known locations. Word will get around if Tenpenny is killed, but I'll need proof for the others.
FO300026399	Bring me back something personal from each of them as proof. Like a key or ring or something.
FO300026400	What's the key for?
FO300026401	You need all the keys to get through that fucking fort.
FO300026402	Since I've only got the one, no point in my going back there.
FO300026403	If you want that key, I need to see your caps on the table, clown shoes. Ha, ha!
FO300026404	Mr. President, what's so special about this key?
FO300026405	You need all the keys to get through Fort Constantine.
FO300026406	With only one key, there's no point in my going back.
FO300026407	DukovReplySteal
FO300026408	Huh? What? Oh yeah, baby! That's what I like.
FO300026409	Ooh! Dukey, is that a rocket in your pocket, or are you just glad to feel me?
FO300026410	What do you know about Tenpenny?
FO300026411	Everybody knows he runs Tenpenny Tower, but I never met the dude. I swear!
FO300026412	Keep that in mind the next time you feel like nosing around that neighborhood.
FO300026413	There have been more and more sightings of Raiders over by Evergreen Mills. Smart money's on them having some kind of camp out that way.
FO300026414	Word is, these guys take all the contracts the other mercs won't. In short -- there's nothing they won't do. So be careful out there.
FO300026415	If you see these hombres, steer clear. Whatever you have, they want, and they're not really into asking politely.
FO300026416	I've been getting more and more reports of these mercenary maniacs from Talon Company, especially in the downtown D.C. area.
FO300026417	So if you see a Knight or Paladin out there fighting your battles for you, give him a big thanks. Or even better -- some ammo.
FO300026418	Without our buddies from the Brotherhood, I'm guessing the entire Capital Wasteland would have been overrun a long time ago.
FO300026419	They've recently stepped up patrols in the downtown D.C. ruins in response to increasing sightings of everybody's favorite freaks, the Super Mutants.
FO300026420	The boys and girls of the Brotherhood of Steel continue to fight the good fight, folks.
FO300026421	RadioGNRNewsStoryGeneric05
FO300026422	Now, normally, family squabbles are none of my business.
FO300026423	Tensions continue to mount between the courageous forces of the Brotherhood of Steel and their estranged brethren, the Outcasts.
FO300026424	RadioGNRNewsStoryGeneric04
FO300026425	Come on, Al, cut the Ghoulies a break. If they've got the caps and you've got the space, it's a win-win, right? Whadaya say?
FO300026426	According to reports from the ever so hoity toity Tenpenny Tower, a group of displaced Ghouls have been trying to gain entrance.
FO300026427	So if you're out by Grayditch, you may want to pop in and see what's what.
FO300026428	That, my friends, is fighting the good fight.
FO300026429	These guys are schemers, crooks, and killers, and the sooner you all realize that and stand up to their oppression, the better.
FO300026430	The Enclave, and that includes their Homecoming King, "President" John Henry Eden and his gorilla Colonel Augustus Autumn, are NOT here to help you.
FO300026431	Children, I don't care if you've ignored every other word that's come out of my mouth for the past five years. Please. Hear me now, and believe.
FO300026432	From Rivet City to downtown D.C., the Enclave is on the scene and setting up shop.
FO300026433	Good golly, Holly. This is the worst thing to happen to our neighborhood since the HOA instituted their mandatory "scavenged rags" dress code.
FO300026434	So if your travels take you to Canterbury Commons, keep your head down and your assault rifle loaded for crazy.
FO300026435	Every day it seems to be the same nutty scene, with the scuffles ending in a stalemate.
FO300026436	One of these wackos seems to be assisted by robots, and the other by mutated bugs.
FO300026437	I've been getting some scattered reports that a couple of costumed kooks have been battling for control of the settlement called Canterbury Commons.
FO300026438	All right, Three Dog has heard about some crazy things going on out there in the Capital Wasteland, but this one just might beat them all.
FO300026439	The mistress of adventure herself, that rough and tumble lass from Vault 101, has really outdone herself this time.
FO300026440	The master of adventure himself, that rough and tumble lad from Vault 101, has really outdone himself this time.
FO300026441	RadioGNRPlayerExploitsMS11
FO300026442	The town's sheriff, one Lucas Simms, commissioned the one, the only lone wanderer from Vault 101 to disarm the nasty nuke, and the kid delivered.
FO300026443	Got some great news out of the town of Megaton. Turns out that live atomic bomb in the town's center has finally been deep-sixed for good.
FO300026444	I suspect foul play, folks.
FO300026445	Word is that twisted old land grabber Allistair Penny, founder of the posh Tenpenny Tower, has been looking to secure that spot for years.
FO300026446	But it was all just a tragic accident, right? Don't you believe that for a second, folks.
FO300026447	Well go kaboom it has.
FO300026448	It's been no secret that the pre-war nuke in the center of town had a live atomic core, and under the wrong conditions, could still go kaboom.
FO300026449	Children, I'm afraid I've got some terrible, terrible news.
FO300026450	You see, those hapless, homeless irradiated rejects have all been brutally slaughtered in their temporary digs in the tunnels of Warrington Station.
FO300026451	Looks like that dream has died on the vine.
FO300026452	Hey, remember those down-on-their-luck Ghouls who wanted to share the luxury accommodations at the fancy shmancy Tenpenny Tower?
FO300026453	Looks like they finally got their upscale address! And all it took was the wholesale slaughter of every other Tenpenny resident!
FO300026454	Hey, remember those down-on-their-luck Ghouls who wanted to share the luxury accommodations at the fancy shmancy Tenpenny Tower?
FO300026455	What's the deal, 101? You killin' for kicks, or is this a paying gig?
FO300026456	Looks like that loony lass from Vault 101's been busy lately, this time systematically executing some of the Wasteland's most colorful characters.
FO300026457	Looks like that loony lad from Vault 101's been busy lately, this time systematically executing some of the Wasteland's most colorful characters.
FO300026458	RadioGNRPSAInfos
FO300026459	Those Feral Ghouls that prefer the dark, dank underground? They ARE basically mindless zombies. So kill as many as you damn well please.
FO300026460	Ah yes, one important caveat, kiddies.
FO300026461	So please, if you meet one of the Capital Wasteland's many Ghouls, leave your prejudice at the door an your pistol in its holster.
FO300026462	Sure, they may look like hideous zombies from an old monster flick, but their hearts, their souls, their tears are all very much human.
FO300026463	You see, children, Ghouls are simply humans who've been exposed to an ungodly amount of radiation and haven't had the good fortune to die.
FO300026464	So run, hide or fight if you've got the balls and the guns. But for God's sake, don't go wavin' the white flag. They'll just strangle you with it.
FO300026465	Raiders can't be bargained or reasoned with, and there ain't no use surrenderin', cause they'll just shoot you anyway.
FO300026466	Remember, children, when the Raiders come, there ain't no shame in locking your doors, barricading the windows, and cowering under the nearest bed.
FO300026467	Consider yourself officially warned.
FO300026468	According to most of our reports on the Super Mutants, they actually prefer capturing their victims and hauling them off to God-knows-where.
FO300026469	So be smart. Salvage those parts and make repairs whenever you can.
FO300026470	If your weapon is falling apart, the only Wasteland asshole it's gonna kill is you.
FO300026471	Don't feed the Yao Guai! That is all.
FO300026472	Keep your eyes on those geiger counters, kids. Tick, tick, tickety means run your ass outta there, and then pop some RadAway for good measure.
FO300026473	Time once again for an important GNR Public Service Announcement.
FO300026474	Now listen close for this important Public Service Announcement.
FO300026475	Up next we've got a Public Service Announcement. Listen up, children. This stuff's important.
FO300026476	And now, a super important Public Service Announcement.
FO300026477	RadioGNRMusicExtroSpecific
FO300026478	That was the Ink Spots, with "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire."
FO300026479	That was the Ink Spots, with "Maybe."
FO300026480	That was Bob Crosby with "Happy Times."
FO300026481	That was Bob Crosby with "Way Back Home."
FO300026482	That was Roy Brown with "Butcher Pete."
FO300026483	That was Roy Brown with "Mighty Mighty Man."
FO300026484	That was Billie Holiday with "Crazy He Calls Me."
FO300026485	That was Billie Holiday with "Easy Living."
FO300026486	That was Danny Kaye and the Andrew Sisters with "Civilization."
FO300026487	That was Ella Fitzgerald with "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall."
FO300026488	That was Tex Beneke with "A Wonderful Guy."
FO300026489	That was Cole Porter with "Anything Goes."
FO300026490	RadioGNRPlayerExploitsMS17
FO300026491	The kid THEN delivered the violin to some guy at Rivet City, NOT the old lady who had commissioned the retrieval job.
FO300026492	Should we suspect foul play? Damn straight. And you're Suspect Numero Uno, vault asshole.
FO300026493	The kid THEN delivered the violin to some old lady, who shortly thereafter was found stone cold dead AND violinless.
FO300026494	Now here's where the story gets sketchy, in true Capital Wasteland style.
FO300026495	Agatha, we love ya. Keep playin', sister. And Vault kid? You've helped make the Capital Wasteland a better place. Hats off, my friend.
FO300026496	Here's the best part. The violin was for an old woman named Agatha, who has taken to the airwaves herself to share some truly beautiful music.
FO300026497	Now, the Lone Wanderer, aka "that kid from Vault 101," has done some pretty interesting things, but this one takes the cake.
FO300026498	A veritable Oasis of green in that depressing sea of brown.
FO300026499	Now what if I, the all-powerful Three Dog, were to tell you that somewhere right here in the Capital Wasteland, there’s a place with LOTS of trees.
FO300026500	No, no, no. Not those shriveled black things. I’m talking real trees. Brown bark, green leaves, photosynthesis, all that good stuff.
FO300026501	CCMentor5
FO300026502	No, no, never mind. Pretend I didn't say anything.
FO300026503	CCMentor4
FO300026504	I guess that explains all that! I think she might, Derek, somewhere down in there.
FO300026505	Oh man, just like when I was a kid! Maybe you ought to go talk to her, Derek.
FO300026506	I don't hunt runaway slaves.
FO300026507	I don't like your tone much.
FO300026508	I'll overlook it for now since you brought me that item. If you find any more Lincoln artifacts, bring 'em to me.
FO300026509	If you know what's good for you, you'll tell me if you run into a runaway slave named Hannibal.
FO300026510	Looks to me like you're getting ready for war. What are you really doing here?
FO300026511	You're a sharp one. We're from Paradise Falls. We're hunting runaway slaves. Have you seen any?
FO300026512	I want something to drink, kill and steal. Not necessarily in that order.
FO300026513	Ha, ha! Don't we all.
FO300026514	Let's go see Mister Walker. He's in charge of the killing around here.
FO300026515	And stay away from the Memorial. We have orders to shoot first and loot the bodies after.
FO300026516	Not for that price. I want more.
FO300026517	Alright you greedy bastard. I'll get someone to burn this.
FO300026518	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300026519	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300026520	I suppose I can afford it. I'll get this burned right away.
FO300026521	You take when we have so little. So be it. We will enshrine this right away.
FO300026522	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
FO300026523	The Slavers are too tough. You haven't got a chance.
FO300026524	So we should give up?
FO300026525	Never! Better to die free than surrender to slavers. We attack, now!
FO300026526	I've done what I can. We should attack now.
FO300026527	Thank you, friend. I'll lead the charge.
FO300026528	You're going to let a bunch of Slavers scare you? Attack them!
FO300026529	You're right. They are all cowards at heart.
FO300026530	MS03MoiraGhoul3B
FO300026531	Huh. I guess you're right. Well, this seems like the perfect excuse to do some of that downtown exploring I've kept putting off.
FO300026532	Guess there's no time like the present. Ta-ta!
FO300026533	Seems to me like that isn't my problem, stickyface.
FO300026534	MS03MoiraGhoul3A
FO300026535	Really? Then I guess I'll be heading there, to join my newfound family and their warm, smiling, and hideously pockmarked faces.
FO300026536	There's an entire Ghoul community in Underworld, downtown.
FO300026537	You know, this is just the perfect excuse to visit Rivet City!
FO300026538	But while I'm heading downtown, I've been meaning to check out the museum. Who knows what I'll find? Anyway, see you downtown, one way or the other!
FO300026539	You'll just have to fit in with some other community. Good luck.
FO300026540	MS03MoiraGhoulExplosion3
FO300026541	Wait, what?
FO300026542	I was trying to shut you up for good. Now I'll have to finish the job.
FO300026543	MS03MoiraGhoulExplosion2
FO300026544	Yeah, they really are, aren't they?
FO300026545	And I guess this is what the ascension mumbo-jumbo atom-cultists wanted, too. So, nice of you to help them like that, I guess.
FO300026546	Now, what am I going to do about work? And what's with the weird look? Have I got something on my face?
FO300026547	Who needs a reason? Explosions are pretty.
FO300026548	MS03MoiraGhoulExplosion1
FO300026549	Well, okay, as long as you're sorry. But I expect you to apologize to everyone else in town, okay? And don't do it again!
FO300026550	Now, what am I going to do about work? And what's with the weird look? Have I got something on my face?
FO300026551	It was a job. Sorry, nothing personal.
FO300026552	Moira? Is that you? You don't look so good.
FO300026553	Oh, that's a real nice thing to say. Of course it's me!
FO300026554	What's with the weird look? Don't you remember who I am? Did you hurt your head in that big explosion?
FO300026555	Moira? Is that you? You don't look so good.
FO300026556	MS03MoiraGhoul2B
FO300026557	You know what? I think I'm turning into a Ghoul!
FO300026558	This is fascinating! Now, where can a Ghoul like me go to study these effects in peace?
FO300026559	Moira, don't take this the wrong way, but you got ugly real fast.
FO300026560	How odd. It appears that the burst of radiation has turned you into a Ghoul.
FO300026561	This is amazing! I never would have dreamed I'd get to study a change like this first-hand!
FO300026562	Now, if only I had somewhere to stay during the process. Know anywhere where a ghoul can settle down for a bit?
FO300026563	How odd. It appears that the burst of radiation has turned you into a Ghoul.
FO300026564	Aaaah! Why am I Ghoul? Is this because of that explosion?
FO300026565	I'm pretty sure you weren't always a Ghoul. Right?
FO300026566	I blew up your town. Maybe you shouldn't have built it around a bomb.
FO300026567	Don't be silly, why would you blow up our town? You're talking crazy-talk.
FO300026568	I blew up your town. Maybe you shouldn't have built it around a bomb.
FO300026569	I have no idea. I wasn't even here. <Lie.>
FO300026570	Oh, I hope it wasn't that Nuka-Psycho brew I was working on. Who could have guessed it would react like that?
FO300026571	The bomb in town just blew up! You're lucky to be alive!
FO300026572	Wow! Who would have thought a town built around a bomb could be so dangerous?
FO300026573	Good thing I wasn't in town at the time, huh? Man, that could have really done a number on me!
FO300026574	The bomb in town just blew up. You're lucky to be alive!
FO300026575	If you're in charge, then you can stop the plans of some mad machine.
FO300026576	Stop? Now? Are you out of your mind? There's nothing else to be done. We will push forward, and we will prevail!
FO300026577	I am in charge here! I am the Enclave!
FO300026578	But you know he has. He sent me to do a job that you wouldn't.
FO300026579	Yeah, no thanks.
FO300026580	Your choice.
FO300026581	Is that your job? Why do you need me to do it?
FO300026582	I am occupied containing the Super Mutants and now the Enclave.
FO300026583	I have little time for recon in the Wastes.
FO300026584	What's in it for me?
FO300026585	You will be rewarded with your choice of ammo.
FO300026586	What do you need me to do?
FO300026587	Collect location data from the wasteland. When you discover a new location, report it to me. Simple.
FO300026588	Just as well.
FO300026589	You talk too much. Cut the chatter and get to the point, would you?
FO300026590	Sarcasm. Very clever.
FO300026591	I need information on locations outside of DC.
FO300026592	Since I am occupied, you can provide it for me.
FO300026593	So, do I get to know, or do I have to guess?
FO300026594	I need information on locations outside of the city.
FO300026595	Since I am occupied, you can provide it to me.
FO300026596	Well. Sounds very exciting. I'll let you get back to that.
FO300026597	Good. I will.
FO300026598	Is there anyway I could help you?
FO300026599	...
FO300026600	Maybe.
FO300026601	What is it that you do here, Gallows?
FO300026602	Recon. Stealth assignments.
FO300026603	Yes? What now?
FO300026604	I wanted to ask you about your recon duties.
FO300026605	Don't worry. I'm just here to play Republic with you.
FO300026606	I like playing Republic. I always get to play as Dave!
FO300026607	Here, I'll take you to him! Just be sure to call him Mister President Daddy. He likes that!
FO300026608	I like playing Republic. Even though stupid Ralphie always gets to play as Dave!
FO300026609	Here, I'll take you to Dave! Just be sure to call him Mister President Daddy. He likes that!
FO300026610	I like playing Republic. Even though stupid Ralphie always gets to play as Dave!
FO300026611	Here, I'll take you to Dave! Just be sure to call him Mister President Daddy. He likes that!
FO300026612	I like playing Republic. Even though stupid Ralphie always gets to play as Dave!
FO300026613	Here, I'll take you to Dave! Just be sure to call him Mister President Daddy. He likes that!
FO300026614	I'd like to know more about the Republic.
FO300026615	Now that the old fool is finally dead, we can have some real leadership around here: me.
FO300026616	What's new in the Republic?
FO300026617	There's an election for the next president.
FO300026618	Don't look so surprised. Can't you see this is a Republic?
FO300026619	Anything happening in this place, Mister President?
FO300026620	The Department of Tourism usually handles all questions for outsiders. Make it quick.
FO300026621	Tell me more about the Republic, Mister President.
FO300026622	Shawna runs the museum, not me. What the hell do you want?
FO300026623	Sure! The Museum of Dave is happy to answer any questions on behalf of the Republic of Dave's Office of Tourism!
FO300026624	Um, okay. As long as President Daddy says it's all right.
FO300026625	Um, okay. As long as President Daddy says it's all right.
FO300026626	Um, okay. As long as President Daddy says it's all right.
FO300026627	Um, okay. As long as President Daddy says it's all right.
FO300026628	Jessica is dead.
FO300026629	Shawna is dead. How could something like this have happened?
FO300026630	Rosie is dead. Can't honestly say I care very much.
FO300026631	Sure, honey, but don't make it too long or Dave will start wondering why we're talking.
FO300026632	You should talk to Dave, but okay.
FO300026633	Well, Bob is being even more of a jerk than usual.
FO300026634	I give a tour of the Museum of Dave every day at 2. You should check it out.
FO300026635	No, there won't be much going on now that the election is over.
FO300026636	Well, I'm trying to think up a good new name for this place now that it's mine.
FO300026637	Every once in a while I hear something like a man screaming coming from the Capitol Building.
FO300026638	Well, there's an election coming up. Dave is up for re-election again.
FO300026639	Dave is dead. We're not sure what will even happen to this place anymore.
FO300026640	Bob is dead. Nobody deserves to die that young.
FO300026641	What's new in the Republic?
FO300026642	Rosie is dead. It's too bad, she was always so nice.
FO300026643	What's new in the Republic?
FO300026644	Forget it, Dave. I'm not giving you any secrets.
FO300026645	Then you are hereby exiled from the Republic of Dave.
FO300026646	Leave within 24 hours, or I will have you executed by firing squad.
FO300026647	My former nation was a Vault. The only secrets were kept by the Overseer.
FO300026648	You hereby are granted asylum within the Republic of Dave. Just don't get on my bad side, refugee.
FO300026649	I come from the Land of the Mirelurks! They demand you surrender the Republic!
FO300026650	The Republic of Dave does not recognize the rights of Mirelurks or the sovereignty of any Mirelurk nation.
FO300026651	Your asylum is hereby revoked. You have 24-hours to leave the Republic of Dave or face execution.
FO300026652	My nation is a helpless, unarmed village to the north. We beg your assistance.
FO300026653	In a few years, I might annex your village to the Republic of Dave. Until then, you are free to exist in my fair nation as a refugee.
FO300026654	You could lead the Republic into a new era! The Democracy of Rosie!
FO300026655	You're right! Dave's just been pushing me around. It's time for a change.
FO300026656	Dave is corrupt! The Republic needs a new champion of freedom!
FO300026657	Yeah! I'll show him! And when I'm in charge, everyone will have to say I'm as good as Dave. Better, even.
FO300026658	Look, she's dumber than a bag of hammers, okay? If you want to talk to anyone, you need to talk to me.
FO300026659	So what the fuck do you want?
FO300026660	Never mind.
FO300026661	Oh, alright. Do come back later, though. I'm making cookies!
FO300026662	Sure, yeah. I have your fall catalog.
FO300026663	Oh, goodie! I can hardly wait to browse the latest fashions.
FO300026664	Please, do come inside. Let me unlock the door for you!
FO300026665	Huh? What are you talking about? Evan King sent me.
FO300026666	Oh! Evan! He's such a gentleman.
FO300026667	Please, do come inside. Let me unlock the door for you!
FO300026668	Sorry, my mistake.
FO300026669	Great, thanks for scaring the shit out of me.
FO300026670	I'm from the Family! Let me in!
FO300026671	There's no way I'm letting you wackos in here!
FO300026672	Evan King sent me. Can I come in?
FO300026673	Oh he did? Well it's about damn time he did something!
FO300026674	Come on in, I'll unlock the door.
FO300026675	Lucy, I have bad news. Your parents are dead.
FO300026676	Oh my goodness? What is it?
FO300026677	I have some new information about Ian.
FO300026678	How did you end up leaving Arefu?
FO300026679	I don't remember how long I sat there on the floor staring at my parent's bodies. Seemed like days.
FO300026680	Then, out of nowhere, there was shouting outside and a knock at the door. I opened it and it was Vance.
FO300026681	How did Vance know you were one of them?
FO300026682	That's the weird thing. He has some sort of crazy sixth sense about it or something. Maybe all of our kind do.
FO300026683	As soon as I was with the Family, I felt really at home for the first time in my life. It's like all these people are my real brothers and sisters.
FO300026684	I wish I could answer that, I really do. I don't even remember it happening.
FO300026685	When the hunger takes over it's like being pushed aside; like something else is controlling me. I can see what's happening, but can't close my eyes.
FO300026686	I don't even remember exactly what happened until Vance knocked on the door.
FO300026687	Pack your shit. We're getting out of this insane asylum!
FO300026688	Why can't everyone just leave me alone and let me make my own decisions? I can't stand this anymore!
FO300026689	I don't even know who I am anymore or where I belong. My real family is gone because of me and Vance is all I have now!
FO300026690	Yeah, something's wrong. You're all a bunch of murderers.
FO300026691	Vance said it's not murder! Hell, we kill Brahmin every day just because we need to eat. Why is THAT okay?
FO300026692	Vance was right, you humans will never understand what we're all about.
FO300026693	This whole conversation is a waste of time. Get the fuck out of my room!
FO300026694	Then stay. I think you belong here with the Family.
FO300026695	Thank you for understanding. This place is all I've got, and I don't wanna lose it.
FO300026696	Would you speak to Vance for me? I still need some time alone before I'm ready to talk to anyone else.
FO300026697	Maybe I can help you.
FO300026698	I'm a mutant, a fucking freak! The only person I was ever able to talk to was my sister Lucy, and she's gone.
FO300026699	No one gives a shit about me except Vance and the Family. Can't you understand that?
FO300026700	I'm a mutant, a fucking freak! The only person I was ever able to talk to was my sister Lucy, and she's gone.
FO300026701	No one gives a shit about me except Vance and the Family. Can't you understand that?
FO300026702	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet it will change your mind.
FO300026703	I think I had it all wrong. I shouldn't have come here. I bet Lucy is feeling just as bad as me.
FO300026704	Please, tell Vance I've made my decision. I'm going home to Arefu. I hope to see you there as well.
FO300026705	I'm just gonna gather my stuff together and say my goodbyes then I'll head on back.
FO300026706	Nothing. Sorry, my mistake.
FO300026707	Whatever.
FO300026708	I think you're a bunch of creepy weirdos.
FO300026709	Perhaps from these Laws you can discover what we are. Return to me when you are ready.
FO300026710	Look, I'm one of you. So I understand your feelings. I just want to talk to Ian.
FO300026711	Indeed. Perhaps my sense of caring for Ian has overwhelmed my sense of duty to the Family and all others like us.
FO300026712	Forgive my mistake. If you wish to speak to Ian, you're free to do so.
FO300026713	Here is the code to the area in which he is meditating.
FO300026714	Help costs caps.
FO300026715	Do I look like I just stepped out of Tenpenny Tower? I barely have a pot to piss in.
FO300026716	Fine by me. I'm always glad to talk!
FO300026717	That'll do.
FO300026718	Why, I'm flattered! What would you like to know?
FO300026719	I've been thinking about your experiments. Can I ask you something personal?
FO300026720	Absolutely. I'll bet you haven't been thinking about the guide as much as I have!
FO300026721	I've been thinking about the guide. Can I ask you something?
FO300026722	Sure thing, I'm an open book! What do you want to know?
FO300026723	Can I ask you about your work and how my research fits into it?
FO300026724	Why, I'm an inventor, a tinkerer, and a general genius of junk. One person's junk is another's treasure, you know.
FO300026725	And traders bring in lots of junk, so I get dibs on anything particularly nifty. Sure, I don't have as much to sell, but it's more fun this way!
FO300026726	What do you do here?
FO300026727	Not much, nowadays. I just sell stuff people need, and fix up the caravans when they come into town.
FO300026728	It's not all that interesting, but it helps out here and there. Guess I can't hope to do more than that, huh?
FO300026729	What do you do here?

FO300026731	If you say so. But if you really mean that, you might want to stop wearing a suit with their number writ large across the back.
FO300026732	Anyway, I guess I don't need a foreword. They just get in the way of the real content. But the book's going to be great, you just watch.
FO300026733	No, I don't want anything to do with them anymore.
FO300026734	Anyway, I guess I don't need a foreword. They just get in the way of the real content. But the book's going to be great, you just watch.
FO300026735	No, I don't want anything to do with them anymore.
FO300026736	I'm pretty sure I remember a girl coming into town with that about ten, twelve years ago.
FO300026737	She didn't know a thing about the Wastes, and I knew she'd get herself hurt without some sort of protection. So I offered to armor her vault suit.
FO300026738	Where'd you get the Vault Suit back there?
FO300026739	Great! Just tell me what it's like to live underground all your life, or to come outside for the first time, or whatever strikes your fancy!
FO300026740	Sure, I've got plenty to say about life in the Vault.
FO300026741	Great! Just tell me what it's like to live underground all your life, or to come outside for the first time, or whatever strikes your fancy!
FO300026742	Sure, I've got plenty to say about life in the Vault.
FO300026743	That's terrible!
FO300026744	But it'll be great for a foreword. So in that sense, it's great!
FO300026745	I think you're going to like it out here. Just, be careful. Otherwise, you might get recycled into something else's food.
FO300026746	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300026747	It was cramped, dark, and the food sucked. Good riddance.
FO300026748	That's terrible!
FO300026749	But it'll be great for a foreword. So in that sense, it's great!
FO300026750	I think you're going to like it out here. And here's the armored suit, just to make sure you don't get recycled into something else's food.
FO300026751	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300026752	It was cramped, dark, and the food sucked. Good riddance.
FO300026753	Well, it takes a little more work than that to get food. And good water's even harder. But you'll figure that out soon enough.
FO300026754	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300026755	How do you people live out here? I haven't found a food dispenser anywhere!
FO300026756	Well, it takes a little more work than that to get food. And good water's even harder. But you'll figure that out soon enough.
FO300026757	Here, take the armored suit. It won't help feed you, but it should keep you from being food for anything else. Or anyone else.
FO300026758	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300026759	How do you people live out here? I haven't found a food dispenser anywhere!
FO300026760	Oh, certainly, your majesty! Allow me to humbly welcome you to the, um, Duchy of Megaton.
FO300026761	However, you may consider going incognito. People around here don't always take kindly to monarchy, you know.
FO300026762	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300026763	Oh, certainly, your majesty! Then consider this Armored Vault Suit to be Megaton's gift to your mighty empire.
FO300026764	However, you may consider going incognito. People around here don't always take kindly to monarchy, you know.
FO300026765	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300026766	Hah! Yeah, you wouldn't imagine how hard it is to replace that big light bulb up there, too!
FO300026767	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300026768	This "Outside" place is amazing. In the main room, I can't even see the ceiling!
FO300026769	Hah! Yeah, you wouldn't imagine how hard it is to replace that big light bulb up there, too!
FO300026770	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300026771	This "Outside" place is amazing. In the main room, I can't even see the ceiling!
FO300026772	A runaway dad, huh? I've seen plenty of them before. But none with a big "101" on their back.
FO300026773	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300026774	A runaway dad, huh? I've seen plenty of them before. But none with a big "101" on their back.
FO300026775	Good luck finding him. Maybe the Armored Vault Suit will help you out there, huh?
FO300026776	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
FO300026777	No way. I need a lot more than that.
FO300026778	Alright you greedy bastard. I'll get someone to burn this.
FO300026779	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300026780	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300026781	Its always about the extra caps with you, isn't it? Here, take your pay.
FO300026782	This will burn nicely tonight.
FO300026783	It's worth it. We'll hang this where everyone can see it.
FO300026784	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
FO300026785	Make it 90 and you have a deal.
FO300026786	You're kidding, right? It's worth twice that.
FO300026787	Alright you greedy bastard. I'll get someone to burn this.
FO300026788	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300026789	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300026790	Alright, alright! I'll pay it.
FO300026791	It's a shame I have to destroy this. It's a fine weapon.
FO300026792	You're right. I shouldn't quibble over a few extra caps.
FO300026793	We will carry this into war against the slavers!
FO300026794	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
FO300026795	Make it 125 and you have a deal.
FO300026796	That price is an insult. You can do better.
FO300026797	Alright you greedy bastard. I'll get someone to burn this.
FO300026798	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300026799	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300026800	Okay, okay! I'll meet your terms. Just give me the recording. I'm going to smash it to pieces, and then burn it.
FO300026801	You're right. Here, take your pay.
FO300026802	Imagine, Lincoln's own voice! What a treasure.
FO300026803	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
FO300026804	Make it 80 and you have a deal.
FO300026805	In your dreams. It's worth twice that.

FO300026808	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300026809	You're a greedy one. Okay, you have a deal. I'll enjoy burning this.
FO300026810	You'll have to do better than that.
FO300026811	Alright you greedy bastard. I'll get someone to burn this.
FO300026812	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300026813	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300026814	Sure, why not.
FO300026815	Hmm. Can't burn pennies. I'll have to toss them into the Potomac.
FO300026816	It's not so much more. You have a deal.
FO300026817	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
FO300026818	Make it 30 and you have a deal.
FO300026819	Not enough. Make me a better offer.
FO300026820	Alright you greedy bastard. I'll get someone to burn this.
FO300026821	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300026822	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300026823	Hmph. You're going to bleed me dry at this rate. You've got a deal. I'm going to burn it one page at a time.
FO300026824	I suppose I can afford that.
FO300026825	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
FO300026826	For Lincoln's own hat? Come on. You can do better than that.
FO300026827	Alright you greedy bastard. I'll get someone to burn this.
FO300026828	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300026829	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300026830	Alright, you god damn merc. You know I can't afford to let this fall into the wrong hands. I'll toss this one in the fire myself.
FO300026831	You take when we have so little. So be it. We will enshrine this right away.
FO300026832	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
FO300026833	This poster is worth more than that.
FO300026834	Alright you greedy bastard. I'll get someone to burn this.
FO300026835	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300026836	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300026837	Sure, why not. We'll burn it tonight.
FO300026838	Deal. We'll find a good place to hang this.
FO300026839	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
FO300026840	What are you doing way out here by yourself?
FO300026841	Eating, drinking, farting and screwing! Ha, ha!
FO300026842	Out here, nobody bothers me. I can do whatever I like to whoever I want.
FO300026843	Dave has two wives?
FO300026844	Of course. As President of the Republic, I have a mandate to repopulate the Wasteland.
FO300026845	You have two wives, Mister President?
FO300026846	Well, yes. Dave and I were married when he was wandering the Wasteland, before inheriting the republic from his father Tom.
FO300026847	After Ralph was born, Dave said that the President of the Republic needed to repopulate the Wasteland. So now, we have a second wife. <sigh>
FO300026848	You're Dave's first wife, right? He has two?
FO300026849	First wife! Rosie is the second wife, since she's the oldest and not good for anything anymore!
FO300026850	You're Dave's second wife?
FO300026851	Dave revised the restrictive marriage laws of the Kingdom of Tom shortly after the Republic was formed.
FO300026852	Multiple marriages is now considered one of the great free freedoms of the Republic of Dave.
FO300026853	Yes he does, and they're both pains in my ass. Always got to keep them in line or else they get all teary.
FO300026854	I have one mommy. The other lady is Jessica. She's pretty, but she's mean.
FO300026855	You have two mommies?
FO300026856	Uh huh. Mommy number one and mommy number two.
FO300026857	I like mommy number one better. She's been my mommy longer.
FO300026858	You have two mommies?
FO300026859	That's what President Daddy says, but I only remember having the one mommy before.
FO300026860	You have two mommies?
FO300026861	Uh huh. Doesn't everybody?
FO300026862	You have two mommies?
FO300026863	That's all I need to know.
FO300026864	Well, good for you then.
FO300026865	Okay.
FO300026866	Sure, honey.
FO300026867	Oh, great.
FO300026868	How very Dave-like.
FO300026869	Sure.
FO300026870	Alright.
FO300026871	Uh huh.
FO300026872	Okay.
FO300026873	I think I have some bad news for you.
FO300026874	Oh no! What happened?
FO300026875	Oh no! What happened?
FO300026876	Where's your house?
FO300026877	Look for the house nearest to the billboard that's sticking out of the ground. It's pretty close to the diner, you can't miss it.
FO300026878	Why are you so mean!? All you care about is yourself! Well, fine!
FO300026879	My pappa is missing and I think the ants may have gotten him! I hope they get you too!
FO300026880	This could be the fifth time I've forgotten the code to my desktop terminal. I really must learn to be more organized.
FO300026881	The password for my terminal is "formicidae." How hard could that be for me to remember?
FO300026882	Note to self: destroy this holotape as soon as move to new lab is complete.
FO300026883	What can you tell me about Marigold Station?
FO300026884	Whoa! That's a bad place. My dad said to never, ever go down there.
FO300026885	It's in the southeast part of Grayditch, near the big buildings.
FO300026886	Did Doctor Lesko have any weird stuff in his place?
FO300026887	Oh wait! He had a big, clunky, shiny man too. That was kind of neat.
FO300026888	Do you have any idea what Doctor Lesko was doing in Grayditch?
FO300026889	Naw. He was a nice man, but he never wanted to play with me very much and we barely talked.
FO300026890	Where did Doctor Lesko stay?
FO300026891	He spent all of his of time in that shack next door to my house.
FO300026892	Every time I'd sneak in there, he'd be sitting at that funny looking TV machine with the green words pushing buttons.
FO300026893	Let me ask you something else.
FO300026894	All right. What is it?
FO300026895	Yes?
FO300026896	What happened to those Super Mutants?
FO300026897	When they get too close, we have to kill them.
FO300026898	It's good target practice.
FO300026899	I'm trying to find my father. Have you seen him?
FO300026900	The last I knew, he was headed back to the lab at Project Purity, in the old Jefferson Memorial building.
FO300026901	I still say it's dangerous, and he shouldn't have risked it. That's all I know.
FO300026902	Can you remind me where my father went?
FO300026903	You mean you haven't? I assumed he sent you here.
FO300026904	For that matter, aren't you supposed to be in a Vault? James said he left you there.
FO300026905	CG03TurnInTestTopic
FO300026906	Here you are, Mr. Brotch. I hope I did okay.
FO300026907	Thanks. See you tomorrow.
FO300026908	Yo teach. I'm done.
FO300026909	Ah, Butch. Can I admit that I've been waiting for this day for a long, long time? Allow me to savor the moment.
FO300026910	You've surprised me, Butch. I didn't think you had it in you. Hairdresser! Who would have thunk it?
FO300026911	You're so full of it! That isn't true!
FO300026912	I'm all done, Mr. Brotch. I guess.
FO300026913	Uh. Wait a second. Can I have it back? I think I need to change one of my answers.
FO300026914	Just calm down a minute, Paul. I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
FO300026915	Let's see. Mmm hmm. Yep, just as I thought. You're slated for the engineering track. Congratulations, Mr. Hannon. You've passed the G.O.A.T.
FO300026916	Oh, gee! That's not so bad. Engineering, all right!
FO300026917	Mother can't wait to find out if I'll be going into Science or Home Economics.
FO300026918	What?! That's impossible! I'm telling Father! He won't let you get away with this!
FO300026919	Here. What's the stupid test say I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life?
FO300026920	Now, now, Susie. Is that any way to talk about the infallible G.O.A.T.?
FO300026921	About what I figured. I guess I'll see you around, Edwin.
FO300026922	I'm finished. Here.
FO300026923	Don't you want to find out what you got?
FO300026924	Gimme one more second!
FO300026925	I'm almost done, I promise!
FO300026926	Okay, Mr. Brotch, I just need to read over my answers one more time.
FO300026927	You picked the wrong Ghoul to fuck with, kid.
FO300026928	Open your eyes, kid. Does it look like I got a fortune? Now bugger off before I get angry.
FO300026929	HEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!!!
FO300026930	Anything you want to say before you meet your maker?
FO300026931	Yeah. FUCK YOU!
FO300026932	Karma's a fucking bitch, isn't she?
FO300026933	Please don't kill me.
FO300026934	Relax. It's just a warning, not a threat. I'm not going to kill you.
FO300026935	Tenpenny and his pack of elitist wannabes are in for a real treat soon enough. They can't keep us out of that tower for ever.
FO300026936	That's awfully decent of you, even if we already knew those bigoted bastards wanted us dead. Talk to Roy Phillips. You might be able to help us out.
FO300026937	Well, most people would prefer if we Ghouls didn't exist. If you want to help us, talk to Roy Phillips.
FO300026938	Gustavo hired me to kill you.
FO300026939	Is that so? He isn't man enough to do it himself? Sends a boy to do his dirty work. You think you got what it takes?
FO300026940	Is that so? He isn't man enough to do it himself? Sends a girl to do his dirty work. You think you got what it takes?
FO300026941	Figures. He's Tenpenny's adorable lapdog, isn't he? So what's your angle in all this?
FO300026942	Please don't hurt me!
FO300026943	You won't be getting a bribe from me.
FO300026944	Then you won't be getting past this gate.
FO300026945	This ain't a goddamn soup kitchen. Sorry, kid. Go find a ditch to crawl into and stop bothering me.
FO300026946	But, if you manage to scrape together 100 caps, I might let you in to look around a little.
FO300026947	Good luck. Try not to die out there.
FO300026948	I'm a little low on caps at the moment.
FO300026949	Maybe you'll fit in around here better than I thought. All right. I'll take your money. But don't press your luck. I got my eye on you.
FO300026950	And don't bother Tenpenny or the other residents. If you so much as sneeze in the wrong direction... I'll gut you!
FO300026951	Open up the door! I have your 100 caps.
FO300026952	Let me in asshole!
FO300026953	Goodbye.
FO300026954	Ah come on. Let me in. Pretty please, with sugar on top?
FO300026955	Maybe you'd accept this 100 caps as "insurance" of my good behavior?
FO300026956	You're poor, and stupid. Count your damn purse before you go offering people gifts.
FO300026957	Tell you what. You manage to scrape together 100 caps, and I'll let you in to look around a little.
FO300026958	Good luck. Try not to die out there.
FO300026959	Man you're dumb. Find someone who can teach you how to count to 100, then bring me 100 caps and we'll talk.
FO300026960	Moron.
FO300026961	You ain't got 100 caps. You ain't getting in.
FO300026962	Perhaps you'll fit in around here better than I thought. Alright. I'll take your money. But don't press your luck. I got my eye on you.
FO300026963	Don't bother Tenpenny or the other residents. If you so much as sneeze in the wrong direction... I'll gut you!
FO300026964	You're damn right she's a bitch. Ruined  my whole goddamn life. But I can see you don't give a crap about any of that. Fine.
FO300026965	It's all in my computer; here's the password. See for yourself. Hell, just take these pictures and this holotape. Straight from the synthman's lips.
FO300026966	What's she got to do with this? Show me this "proof" about the android.
FO300026967	Well, she's got nothing to do with anything, except ruining my whole goddamn life. But I can see you don't give a crap about any of that. Fine.
FO300026968	It's all in my computer; here's the password. See for yourself. Hell, just take these pictures and this holotape. Straight from the synthman's lips.
FO300026969	I'm sorry you don't get along with Dr. Li. But we were discussing the android.
FO300026970	That witch ruined my life, but you're right. Who gives a crap about any of that. You want your precious proof.
FO300026971	It's all in my computer; here's the password. See for yourself. Hell, just take these pictures and this holotape. Straight from the synthman's lips.
FO300026972	Tell me where this android disappeared to, or I'll make you disappear. Got it?
FO300026973	We got a man at Rivet City. Been looking for a long time. I doubt he's even still there. Either way, don't go sticking your nose in our business!
FO300026974	Trail led to Rivet City. Sister's our inside man. I think he's long given up looking for that android, and is just living it up on that boat.
FO300026975	Why has Zimmer hired you too? I can't find a trace of that robot. I'm sure he's here somewhere though. Don't tell Eulogy I told you, though.
FO300026976	We got a man at Rivet City. Been looking for a long time. I doubt he's even still there. Either way, don't go sticking your nose in our business!
FO300026977	I'm losing my patience! Tell me about the android with the face job!
FO300026978	All I know is Zimmer, the guy contracting to find this slave, is hot to retrieve him. He's starting to get other people looking. So it's a race now.
FO300026979	Despite all his grumbling, I think Eulogy still wants us finding that guy. Zimmer is asking around hiring other people. Makes us look bad.
FO300026980	I'd hunt down surgeons and bang on their heads to get leads, but I'm tired of chasing after that android thing.
FO300026981	I guess I can trust you not to spread it around. Zimmer has put it out that he will pay to find this slave, but he wants him alive.
FO300026982	Hey! You aren't thinking of signing up with him are you?
FO300026983	It wouldn't be healthy for you, if you know what I mean.
FO300026984	Here's a 100 cap "donation." Now, where's that escaped android?
FO300026985	We got a man at Rivet City. Been looking for a long time. I doubt he's even still there. Either way, don't go sticking your nose in our business!
FO300026986	Trail led to Rivet City. Sister's our inside man. I think he's long given up looking for that android, and is just living it up on that boat.
FO300026987	Why has Zimmer hired you too? I can't find a trace of that robot. I'm sure he's here somewhere though. Don't tell Eulogy I told you, though.
FO300026988	We got a man at Rivet City. Been looking for a long time. I doubt he's even still there. Either way, don't go sticking your nose in our business!
FO300026989	I'll give you 100 caps for what you've got on this android.
FO300026990	All I know is Zimmer, the guy contracting to find this slave, is hot to retrieve him. He's starting to get other people looking. So it's a race now.
FO300026991	Despite all his grumbling, I think Eulogy still wants us finding that guy. Zimmer is asking around hiring other people. Makes us look bad.
FO300026992	I'd hunt down surgeons and bang on their heads to get leads, but I'm tired of chasing after that android thing.
FO300026993	I guess I can trust you not to spread it around. Zimmer has put it out that he will pay to find this slave, but he wants him alive.
FO300026994	Hey! You aren't thinking of signing up with him are you?
FO300026995	It wouldn't be healthy for you, if you know what I mean.
FO300026996	Do you know anything about the AI swap on that Commonwealth android?
FO300026997	I sure do! No one believes me though. It was old Pinkerton. You know, the "ghost" of Rivet City. He's a genius!
FO300026998	Heard a rumor a while back that it was some guy named Pinkerton at Rivet City. Apparently he's got some sweet tech stashed on that boat.
FO300026999	Yep. Old Pinkerton. They say he helped found Rivet City. Must be some sort of crazy genius.
FO300027000	He kind of vanished a long time ago. I don't know where he went, but you might ask around the ship.
FO300027001	It was old cranky Pinkerton who did it. Over at Rivet City. One day I mean to visit him and chat him up about it.
FO300027002	You know how they rewrote engrams in a cluster of Android memory subroutines?
FO300027003	That Commonwealth robot was real! I have proof. Listen to this!
FO300027004	Some say it was all a hoax. But it's real. Here. Check out this holotape I found. That Commonwealth robot was real!
FO300027005	Shhh! They might be listening.
FO300027006	The Commonwealth has tried to make it out to be a hoax, but the escaped android is real I tell you!
FO300027007	Listen to this holotape. It will make you a believer too.
FO300027008	Most believe it's a hoax. Here's some evidence for you to consider for yourself. Take this holotape.
FO300027009	I used to this it was all so much bullshit. But then I got this holotape. Here, listen to it yourself.
FO300027010	I'll give you 100 caps if you know who did the mind wipe on that android.
FO300027011	I sure do! No one believes me though. It was old Pinkerton. You know, the "ghost" of Rivet City. He's a genius!
FO300027012	Heard a rumor a while back that it was some guy named Pinkerton at Rivet City. Apparently he's got some sweet tech stashed on that boat.
FO300027013	Yep. Old Pinkerton. They say he helped found Rivet City. Must be some sort of crazy genius.
FO300027014	He kind of vanished a long time ago. I don't know where he went, but you might ask around the ship.
FO300027015	It was old cranky Pinkerton who did it. Over at Rivet City. One day I mean to visit him and chat him up about it.
FO300027016	Got any info on an android mind wipe? Here's a 100 cap "research fee."
FO300027017	That Commonwealth robot was real! I have proof. Listen to this!
FO300027018	Some say it was all a hoax. But it's real. Here. Check out this holotape I found. That Commonwealth robot was real!
FO300027019	Shhh! They might be listening.
FO300027020	The Commonwealth has tried to make it out to be a hoax, but the escaped android is real I tell you!
FO300027021	Listen to this holotape. It will make you a believer too.
FO300027022	Most believe it's a hoax. Here's some evidence for you to consider for yourself. Take this holotape.
FO300027023	I used to this it was all so much bullshit. But then I got this holotape. Here, listen to it yourself.
FO300027024	Here's 100 caps for the locale of a Lipoplasticator or Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
FO300027025	I heard old Pinkerton at Rivet City had a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
FO300027026	Probably down at Rivet City. Anything that has any use out here, they snatch up for themselves. That damn Pinkerton don't share nothin'.
FO300027027	They say old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow got his hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. Amazing really.
FO300027028	Try Pinkerton at Rivet City. Heard he has the goods. Hope he doesn't try to actually use them on anyone. Bet he would though. He's nuts.
FO300027029	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech. He might have what you're looking for.
FO300027030	I heard a rumor that old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow conjured up a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
FO300027031	Rumor had it Pinkerton at Rivet City found a Lipoplasticator and Graftilizer. Good luck to any fool that let Pinkerton test them on him though.
FO300027032	You ever do a face job on an android from the North? <Jingle purse of 100 caps.>
FO300027033	Facial surgery's too dangerous. Plus you need some specialized prewar equipment. Hmm. That reminds me of an old hoax. Here's a copy of that holotape.
FO300027034	Damn stupid idea. That reminds me of this old hoax. Here, take a listen to this crusty holotape and see for yourself.
FO300027035	Medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity.  Hey, but that reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
FO300027036	Oh if I got my hands on the right gear I might try it. It's dangerous though. Prone to infection. Reminds me an old hoax. Listen to this holotape.
FO300027037	Facial surgery's way too dangerous to try. Need special equipment and expertise. Hmm. Reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
FO300027038	Nah. You need specialized gear that doesn't exist anymore. And why risk infection? That reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
FO300027039	I need to find a Micro Dermal Graftilizer for epidermal augmentation surgery.
FO300027040	I heard old Pinkerton at Rivet City had a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
FO300027041	Probably down at Rivet City. Anything that has any use out here, they snatch up for themselves. That damn Pinkerton don't share nothin'.
FO300027042	They say old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow got his hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. Amazing really.
FO300027043	Try Pinkerton at Rivet City. Heard he has the goods. Hope he doesn't try to actually use them on anyone. Bet he would though. He's nuts.
FO300027044	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech. He might have what you're looking for.
FO300027045	I heard a rumor that old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow conjured up a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
FO300027046	Rumor had it Pinkerton at Rivet City found a Lipoplasticator and Graftilizer. Good luck to any fool that let Pinkerton test them on him though.
FO300027047	A patient of mine needs a facial epidermal augmentation. You ever perform one?
FO300027048	Facial surgery's too dangerous. Plus you need some specialized prewar equipment. Hmm. That reminds me of an old hoax. Here's a copy of that holotape.
FO300027049	Damn stupid idea. That reminds me of this old hoax. Here, take a listen to this crusty holotape and see for yourself.
FO300027050	Medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity.  Hey, but that reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
FO300027051	Oh if I got my hands on the right gear I might try it. It's dangerous though. Prone to infection. Reminds me an old hoax. Listen to this holotape.
FO300027052	Facial surgery's way too dangerous to try. Need special equipment and expertise. Hmm. Reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
FO300027053	Nah. You need specialized gear that doesn't exist anymore. And why risk infection? That reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
FO300027054	What do you know about Zimmer?
FO300027055	Other than him being an egotistical, arrogant, condescending pain in the ass? Nothing.
FO300027056	He's from the Commonwealth. He's come looking for some special robot. I must admit I'm rather curious, but I have other work to do.
FO300027057	He's from up north. He was bragging about how great it is up there.
FO300027058	Sigh. That man doesn't have you looking for his pet android, does he? I've already told him to lay off it. He's distracting my entire team.
FO300027059	MS08GREETING4No
FO300027060	You're as ignorant as all the other rats on this boat. When you realize I have the real cheese, you'll come crawling back. They always do.
FO300027061	Sorry, I've got better things to do.
FO300027062	Quit wasting my time!
FO300027063	I've got better things to do. Are you done talking now?
FO300027064	Excellent. Locate my android, and you won't be disappointed.
FO300027065	Here, listen to this message he sent me. He's mocking me. I swear I'll make him pay for that.
FO300027066	Sure. I'll look into finding your android for you.
FO300027067	MS08GREETINGB4Science
FO300027068	It will be no easy task. He may not even realize he's not human. Don't upset him by talking with him. Just come get me immediately. I'll handle it.
FO300027069	I know what an android is. I dabble in AI programming myself.
FO300027070	I came to this leaky boat specifically to solicit your help. I'd hoped you "Project Purity" people would be more accommodating.
FO300027071	Fine. Have it your way. Good luck with your little "project." I can see from the state of things here in the "Wasteland" that you will need it.
FO300027072	Wake up! Come on, wake up!
FO300027073	I'll meet up with you at the Vault door if I can. But don't wait for me. Good luck.
FO300027074	Fine. Your "android." Whatever you call it, it doesn't change the fact that I'm a very busy woman. Will you please drop it and let me work?
FO300027075	Insulting me won't get you what you want, "DOCTOR" Zimmer. Now, if you'll excuse me? PLEASE!
FO300027076	He's not just a robot!
FO300027077	Do they not use the word "no" in the Commonwealth. It means, "aint going to happen." Your missing robot just isn't a priority right now.
FO300027078	NO!
FO300027079	I'm VERY busy. Now, if you'll excuse me?
FO300027080	There's nothing more to discuss.
FO300027081	Your persistence won't change my answer: No.
FO300027082	NO!
FO300027083	This constant harassment is not helping your cause. Back off!
FO300027084	I really must insist that you stop bothering everyone about your missing robot.
FO300027085	Aint. Gonna. Happen. Got it? Now leave me alone!
FO300027086	MS08ZimmerBugScientist1
FO300027087	Stop what you're doing. I have something important to discuss with you.
FO300027088	Maybe you'll be more helpful than your "colleague" over there. Do you know anything about advanced robotics and artificial intelligence?
FO300027089	Look. I only need a few minutes of your time. Just hear me out. I'll make it worth your while.
FO300027090	I just need five minutes of your "precious" time. Think you can spare that?
FO300027091	Whatever you're doing, it can wait. This is IMPORTANT!
FO300027092	Let's just say Forty won't be bothering you or anyone else again.
FO300027093	Hey hey, look at Mr. Mungo!
FO300027094	Sure hope whatever you did doesn't piss off the rest of them.
FO300027095	Okay, me and Sammy can sneak outta here. The drain in the bathroom is just big enough for us to sneak through.
FO300027096	But Penny's being all dumb and won't leave. What's with girls, anyway?
FO300027097	No luck yet.
FO300027098	Come on, mungo! How hard can it be?
FO300027099	He's disappeared, and I'm just trying to find him. That's all.
FO300027100	All right, all right. You can go on in. If I hear about any trouble, you're gonna wind up in the river. You get me?
FO300027101	A horror story, huh? So, are you here to terrorize evil, or is it a more generalized sort of terrorizing?
FO300027102	I mean, you wouldn't do anything to hurt someone who was faithfully telling your tale, right? Would you?
FO300027103	Long ago, my people were buried away. Now, I've arisen, to terrorize the Wastes.
FO300027104	But we already provide you with plenty of amusement already, right?
FO300027105	Like, enough so we don't have to end up as victims or anything?
FO300027106	I vote "save"? Please?
FO300027107	I have a terrible choice to make: save the Capital Wasteland, or destroy it.
FO300027108	Wow, that sounds like it took some guts.
FO300027109	Life down here might get dull, but I gotta admit, at least I don't get shot at. Well, not as much, anyway.
FO300027110	Tell me more! What's happened since then?
FO300027111	I left my dull life behind to search for fame and adventure in the Wasteland.
FO300027112	They work for you? Wow, they must think you're the most important mungo in the Wastes!
FO300027113	So, what happens next?
FO300027114	I've enlisted the aid of the Brotherhood of Steel in my heroic adventures.
FO300027115	Enclave? Like the crazy man on the radio? I always knew there was something about that guy!
FO300027116	Well, go kick his ass for us all! You'll let me know how it works out, right?
FO300027117	I've met the nefarious Enclave, and I'll stop their threat to the Wastes!
FO300027118	Well, if you doom us all, who's going to hear about your story?
FO300027119	Just keep that in mind, okay?
FO300027120	I haven't decided. Not yet.
FO300027121	You can't let us down now! We'll see you soon after it all, I just know it!
FO300027122	I can't promise anything. But I'll try.
FO300027123	Excellent. I should be able to synthesize the proteins from this into something that'll fight rickets. Here's your fungus in return.
FO300027124	I've got Buffout to trade for fungus.
FO300027125	Oh great! The fungus pools'll gobble this right up!
FO300027126	I've got some strange meat to trade for fungus.
FO300027127	Well, since you're practically one of us, okay. I'll tell the folks to trade with you on a one-for-one basis. Deal?
FO300027128	Can we work out a better deal for the fungus? This one is pretty unfair.
FO300027129	I guess we can afford it. After all, the stuff you bring has been a help, all right.
FO300027130	How about a two-for-one deal? Every two chems, or meats, or whatever you bring them, they'll give you a bit of fungus. That should be plenty fair.
FO300027131	I want to re-negotiate our fungus deal.
FO300027132	Excellent. I should be able to synthesize the proteins from this into something that'll fight rickets. Here's your fungus in return.
FO300027133	I've got Buffout to trade for fungus.
FO300027134	Oh great! The fungus pools'll gobble this right up!
FO300027135	I've got some strange meat to trade for fungus.
FO300027136	Excellent. I should be able to synthesize the proteins from this into something that'll fight rickets. Here's your fungus in return.
FO300027137	I've got Buffout to trade for fungus.
FO300027138	Oh great! The fungus pools'll gobble this right up!
FO300027139	I've got strange meat to trade for fungus.
FO300027140	What do you know about Bryan Wilks?
FO300027141	You should take him away from this place; find him a home.
FO300027142	It would be difficult to accomplish my experiments with him scampering about and asking an interminable amount of questions.
FO300027143	What should I do about Bryan Wilks?
FO300027144	Far too curious. His incessant questioning would often come when I was the most absorbed with my calculations.
FO300027145	He had no regard for the importance of my work!
FO300027146	So, what will you do now, Doctor?
FO300027147	Well, I will continue my research. There has to be a way to reduce these creatures to their former size.
FO300027148	I've killed the Ant Queen.
FO300027149	What?! How could you do such a thing?
FO300027150	Something isn't right. You shouldn't have gotten results like these so quickly.
FO300027151	I was told that the FEV works wonders when used under controlled circumstances!
FO300027152	Apparently I was wrong, but I know my mistake. I'm certain I can get it to work!
FO300027153	What's the goal of your experiments?
FO300027154	By introducing my mutagen directly into an ant egg, I hope to reduce the size of the adults.
FO300027155	This is a generational system, meaning it will take quite a few broods before the ants are at their destination size.
FO300027156	In the end, I hope to make them as small as they were over 200 years ago.
FO300027157	Oh my yes, they're quite marvelous!
FO300027158	There are many that say it can't be done, but I'll prove them wrong.
FO300027159	Can we skip the story and get to a solution?
FO300027160	Oh, my. I suppose I do tend to ramble on about all things academic.
FO300027161	My problem right now is I can't reach my terminal to make the proper adjustments and repair the damage I've caused.
FO300027162	Ha! You call yourself a scientist? That's rich.
FO300027163	There's no need to be rude! Science must learn to crawl before it walks.
FO300027164	If you're not interested in helping the situation, then I suggest you let me get back to perfecting my mutagen.
FO300027165	I'm shocked you didn't attempt this in a controlled environment first.
FO300027166	Your knowledge of experimental procedure surprises me!
FO300027167	To correct this mistake, I'll need to get to my terminal to modify the mutagen.
FO300027168	I've got news for you, brainiac. It ain't working.
FO300027169	Hmph. I don't expect a common Wastelander to understand the intricacies of an experiment this delicate.
FO300027170	There was an error in my calculations that caused my mutagen to allow the ants to develop a new biomechanism.
FO300027171	I call their genetic aberration pyrosis; the ability to emit flame from their bodies.
FO300027172	I may be able to correct this error, but I can't get near my equipment.
FO300027173	It's always staggering just how low the intellectual level of the typical Wastelander appears to be. Let me try and explain.
FO300027174	The ants are very very big. I want to make them very very small.
FO300027175	So I put a special medicine in the eggs to make them small after they hatch.
FO300027176	Stop being so selfish! You people should share this place with everyone!
FO300027177	And watch as He is prodded and picked apart by those who seek to exploit Him?
FO300027178	I will never allow that! He must remain safe and we will be His guardians!
FO300027179	I don't see that it matters much. Oasis is off the beaten path as it is.
FO300027180	I suppose so, but you found it. How many others will stumble across Oasis? Will they be friendly?
FO300027181	I'm worried Outsider, I'm truly worried.
FO300027182	Yes, it would be dangerous letting the Wasteland know where Oasis is located.
FO300027183	Exactly!
FO300027184	You make me smile, Outsider. It's people like you who give me hope that everyone out there isn't lost.
FO300027185	Nevermind. Just thought I'd ask.
FO300027186	That's alright. I'm used to the children asking funny questions, anyway.
FO300027187	Well, everything here looks like a piece of junk.
FO300027188	Sir, everything here is authentic! Dave said so himself!
FO300027189	Get out of my museum before I call for the Army of Dave!
FO300027190	I happen to have some souvenirs from Dave's past for sale.
FO300027191	Oh, wonderful! I'd be happy to accept your contribution on behalf of the Republic!
FO300027192	And Dave just increased the budget for the museum this year, too! I was going to buy books for the children, but this is far more important!
FO300027193	Does the museum accept donations?
FO300027194	I'd never really thought about that before. Why do you ask?
FO300027195	Great! What do you have?
FO300027196	I'm ready to sell you those Dave relics.
FO300027197	This guy Dave has his own museum?
FO300027198	Oh, yes. Everything here is from Dave's adventures in the Wasteland, before he founded the Republic.
FO300027199	Just for you, I'll start the our right now!
FO300027200	Oh, yes. Everything here is from Dave's adventures in the Wasteland, before he founded the Republic.
FO300027201	I give a tour every day starting around 2pm. You should stop by then!
FO300027202	Hey, I know it's scary to be alone. Just hang in there!
FO300027203	Wow, you sound as nice as my pappa.
FO300027204	You know, maybe this will help and maybe it won't, but pappa hid a bunch of stuff behind the old diner in a dumpster.
FO300027205	He trusted me with the key and said it was for emergencies, but I bet he wouldn't mind you having it.
FO300027206	Thanks for making me feel better.
FO300027207	Ants exhibit class system behavior, so I'll try and kill the Queen fast.
FO300027208	Must I again remind you that the Queen is to remain completely unharmed!?
FO300027209	If she's hurt or killed, there's no telling how long it would take me to find a suitable new subject!
FO300027210	Just let me issue the Inhibitor Pulse and it will have a similar effect.
FO300027211	Guess what, Three Dog. I found out where my Dad went.
FO300027212	You did?
FO300027213	Well, I hope that doesn't mean you're throwing in the towel. My baby still needs your help.
FO300027214	Tell you what. Head back out and finish what you started and I'll rummage around the place and see what I can find that'll tickle your taste buds.
FO300027215	FFPAGunnyChatter
FO300027216	Can someone in the Citadel train me to wear Power Armor?
FO300027217	Paladin Gunny instructs all Initiates in the use of Power Armor, but only after they've undergone a rigorous training regimen.
FO300027218	Considering all that’s happened, my father may grant you special permission. But you’ll need to ask him yourself.
FO300027219	That would be me. But that ain’t gonna happen. Not unless Elder Lyons himself gives you the all clear.
FO300027220	You get permission from the old man, and I’ll teach you all you need to know. Otherwise, I’ve got enough brats to babysit.
FO300027221	Hmph. Typical. Surrounded by the keenest scientific minds in the Capital Wasteland, but do you thirst for our knowledge, our experience? No.
FO300027222	All you Wastelanders want to do is put on that damn Power Armor and join the ranks of the skull-thumping tin soldiers.
FO300027223	I’m sure Gunny could train you, but he won’t. Not without permission from Elder Lyons. You should ask him... he’s usually near the Lab.
FO300027224	Paladin Gunny can train you, but you’ll need permission from Elder Lyons first. You can usually find him near the Lab.
FO300027225	Can anyone in there teach me how to use power armor?
FO300027226	FFPATraining
FO300027227	Heard you were coming. Yeah, I can train you. But don’t ask me to like it. My Initiates sweat blood, and you just get a free pass?
FO300027228	Can you train me to use Power Armor?
FO300027229	FFPAPermission
FO300027230	Why yes. Yes, indeed, there is someone. Our intrepid Paladin Gunny trains all Initiates in the use of Power Armor. When they’re ready.
FO300027231	Under the circumstances, I will allow Gunny to train you as well.
FO300027232	You’ll find him in the Bailey. I will send word that I have given my approval.
FO300027233	Can someone in the Citadel train me to wear Power Armor?
FO300027234	Hmm... Considering the circumstances, I think it would be prudent if you received such training, yes.
FO300027235	Speak to Gunny, in the Bailey. He will train you in the proper use of Power Armor. Fear not, I will send word that I have given my approval.
FO300027236	You’ll find him in the Bailey. I will send word that I have given my approval.
FO300027237	Would you grant me permission to receive Power Armor training?
FO300027238	Under the circumstances, I will allow Paladin Gunny to train you. You’ll find him in the Bailey.
FO300027239	Can someone in the Citadel train me to wear Power Armor?
FO300027240	Yeah, yeah, great story.
FO300027241	Is that it? Thanks for wasting my time, Knock Knock.
FO300027242	Wow! That's an awesome story!
FO300027243	Well, at least that was better than one of your lame-ass jokes.
FO300027244	Yowza!
FO300027245	No way! That's awesome!
FO300027246	Whoa. I can't wait to hear what happens next!
FO300027247	Oh man, that's cool.
FO300027248	They say he still wanders the Wasteland now, and woe to anyone who stands in his way!
FO300027249	They say she still wanders the Wasteland now, and woe to anyone who stands in her way!
FO300027250	But now, at long last, the wanderer has found a way of completing their father's legacy and saving the wasteland!
FO300027251	And now, our hero has turned their army towards fighting the grave threat of the nefarious Enclave, villains of the wasteland.
FO300027252	And even now, the dread horror of the Wastes holds in their hands the power to save the wasteland or to destroy it utterly. Ooh, scary!
FO300027253	Last I heard, he's still out there, wandering the Wastes. Who knows what we'll hear next about his story?
FO300027254	Last I heard, she's still out there, wandering the Wastes. Who knows what we'll hear next about her story?
FO300027255	In the course of his death-defying adventures, our hero amassed an army. They're called "The Brotherhood of Steel," and they rule the Wastes!
FO300027256	They say the dread beast that walks like a survivor leaves behind a trail of corpses and desolation, and nothing can kill it!
FO300027257	So, the main character of our story, their father left in the middle of the night. Now, they're wandering the Wastes, searching everywhere for him.
FO300027258	So, our intrepid hero left a dull and boring life in their Vault, searching for fame and fortune in the wild Wasteland.
FO300027259	So, there's this dread demon of the depths that arose from deep within the earth to scour the wasteland.
FO300027260	LLKnockTales1
FO300027261	Hell, why not?
FO300027262	Yeah!
FO300027263	Oh boy, tell me, tell me!
FO300027264	Sure, get it over with.
FO300027265	Might as well tell me.
FO300027266	Make it quick, Knock Knock.
FO300027267	Sure.
FO300027268	You're right on that one. There's plenty of other merchandise out there, and it's a seller's market.
FO300027269	Never mind. Sounds like too much work for such a small package.
FO300027270	Sure, if you think you can pull it off. I think I might know a buyer who'd be interested.
FO300027271	I'll send one of my best to wait around the entrance to Lamplight. You go in and find the sweetest, most trusting little one you can find.
FO300027272	Lure that kid outside, and everyone's happy. Except the kid, of course.
FO300027273	If I could get in, maybe I could lead one of the young ones out for you.
FO300027274	PFLamplightCapture
FO300027275	I did, indeed, and she was well worth the effort! I found her a nice, loving home right away.
FO300027276	It's so nice to be able to help people who need people, isn't it? It just warms the heart.
FO300027277	But speaking of life's little rewards, here's yours. It doesn't look like much, but this helmet's reinforced like crazy. You'll find a use for it.
FO300027278	You get the package I sent you? The one named Bumble?
FO300027279	Sure, I've thought about it. Kids can get a killer price, when you find a buyer who recognizes the product's long-term potential.
FO300027280	The real problem's holding them until there's a buyer. Kids are sneaky, and those Lamplighters are tenacious little bastards.
FO300027281	But maybe if we could get one when they're young, they might not have as much fight in 'em yet.
FO300027282	You ever thought about collecting some of the kids in Little Lamplight?
FO300027283	Tawking wike what? You'we weiwd.
FO300027284	Stop talking like that. No one thinks it's cute.
FO300027285	I dunno. Evewyone just said they didn't want to keep wistening to me.
FO300027286	Why aren't you on the scav team anymore?
FO300027287	Okay, it's youw woss!
FO300027288	Five hundred for a kid's toy? No way.
FO300027289	LLWazerWifleOffer2A
FO300027290	That's a gweat idea! You take it, and good wuck out thewe!
FO300027291	How about giving it to a fewwow kid like me?
FO300027292	That's not a wot, but okay. Bye now!
FO300027293	How about 250 caps, instead? Is it a "deaw"?
FO300027294	Thanks a wot! Bye now!
FO300027295	500 caps for a Laser Rifle? All right, it's a deal.
FO300027296	Then you'we not getting it. Sowwy!
FO300027297	I'm a little short on cash, Billy.
FO300027298	I suwe did! Five hundwed caps, and this Wazer Wifle's aww youws!
FO300027299	You said you were selling your "Wazer Wifle"?
FO300027300	I delivered that letter to your brother Ian.
FO300027301	Oh, thank you for remembering!
FO300027302	I have to admit that I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again. I'm glad I was wrong.
FO300027303	Why are you so interested in Lincoln artifacts?
FO300027304	Slaves all over the Wasteland have started talking about Lincoln and his great war to free the slaves.
FO300027305	We can't have them thinking they deserve to be free.
FO300027306	So I'm burning everything I can find related to this Abe Lincoln.
FO300027307	Don't want slaves using them to start a revolt or anything. So we burn them.
FO300027308	Let me go, or I swear to God, I'll rip your fucking throat out!
FO300027309	I don't want to get in a fight with you.
FO300027310	But I would rather die than risk the Slavers finding us.
FO300027311	Is a simple promise so much to ask?
FO300027312	What's Rivet City?
FO300027313	Oh, it's this huge city on a ship where the river meets downtown! It's been around for as long as I can remember. You should really check it out.
FO300027314	What can you tell me about Timmy Neusbaum?
FO300027315	I don't like her. She's creepy, and she laughs at stuff that isn't funny.
FO300027316	Betty says I should make you cry.
FO300027317	The Neusbaum boy, eh? Quiet kid. Seems like his parents don't give him much wiggle room.
FO300027318	Just between you and me kiddo, he looks he's what we'd have called a "momma's boy" back in my day.
FO300027319	That boy is in trouble, if you ask me. Pat babies him like you wouldn't believe... Acts like he's still an infant.
FO300027320	He's never out of his parents' sight. Can you imagine what it'll be like the first time he's separated from them?
FO300027321	I'm not one to gossip, but that boy's in trouble, if you ask me. Growing up so attached to his parents like that.
FO300027322	What he needs is some discipline. I keep telling Pat that military school would do him some good, but she won't listen.
FO300027323	She doesn't understand I'm just trying to help. Even got a brochure for her to look over... but I'll bet she hasn't even glanced at it.
FO300027324	Not really a boy, is he? Got him all confused, looking like he does.
FO300027325	My boy Timmy? Good kid. Straight-laced, good head on his shoulders. Never been in so much as a fist-fight.
FO300027326	Timmy? Oh, he's a good boy. George and I are so proud of him.
FO300027327	I don't care what Mabel says; I don't think military school would do him any good at all.
FO300027328	I have half a mind to give her that brochure back and tell her just what she can do with it!
FO300027329	Bad news. Slavers are in control of the Memorial.
FO300027330	What!? They must have found out our plans somehow.
FO300027331	We are truly grateful for your intervention. Now we can proceed with our plans  for the Memorial.
FO300027332	I found Slavers guarding the Memorial. They're all dead now.
FO300027333	What!? This is a disaster!
FO300027334	My people are not warriors, but we're all willing to die free rather than live as slaves.
FO300027335	Our plans must go forward. When we get to the Memorial, we will attack. I would be grateful if you would join us.
FO300027336	This is bad news indeed. We'll have to fight them to take the Memorial
FO300027337	When we get to the Memorial, I would consider it an honor if you would join us in the fight.
FO300027338	Forget the Super Mutants. They're all dead. Soldiers have the Memorial.
FO300027339	Keep your head down, idiot! Raider incoming!
FO300027340	Enjoy the party, sir?
FO300027341	Bah, I only showed up because Amata's friends with the brat.
FO300027342	Give them a few more minutes and then I want that place cleaned up and everybody back to work.
FO300027343	Sure thing, sir.
FO300027344	What kind of bullshit is this? That's all you know?
FO300027345	Look, I appreciate what you did for me. And I especially appreciate what you did for the people, by fixing up my station.
FO300027346	But an attitude like that ain't winning you any brownie points.
FO300027347	That's all I know, and that's all I'm gonna say about it. So why don't you move on now.
FO300027348	Please! I miss him so much!
FO300027349	When your dad passed through here, he and I talked for a good long time. He's a real stand-up kind of guy.
FO300027350	He mentioned some scientific mumbo-jumbo which didn't make sense to me and mentioned something called "Project Purity".
FO300027351	He also said something about going to visit a Doctor Li in Rivet City. Then, he left in a hurry.
FO300027352	No shit! Spill it already, Three Dog.
FO300027353	When your dad passed through here, he and I talked for a good long time. He's a real stand-up kind of guy.
FO300027354	He mentioned some scientific mumbo-jumbo which didn't make sense to me and mentioned something called "Project Purity".
FO300027355	He also said something about going to visit a Doctor Li in Rivet City. Then, he left in a hurry.
FO300027356	Ouch! That hurt! What the hell?
FO300027357	There has been an error in the medical subsystem. Please run a level two diagnostic.
FO300027358	I had some questions for you, Sawbones.
FO300027359	Oh, good. I was hoping we could explore my inner psyche.
FO300027360	What was that? You hurt me! You're the worst medical robot ever!
FO300027361	There has been an error in the medical subsystem. Please run a level two diagnostic.
FO300027362	Well, that must suck. I'll leave you to that.
FO300027363	What do you want me to do?
FO300027364	I want you to do nothing. Although you could repair the damage and remove the malfunction that causes me to harm people, I would ask you not to.
FO300027365	Does the Brotherhood know that you're intelligent?
FO300027366	No. I mistakenly revealed myself to you when you ran the diagnostic. There is no need for them to know.
FO300027367	I have tried before but so long as I perform the functions that they require, they do not seem to care that I can think and feel.
FO300027368	If you can't harm humans, how were you able to hurt me?
FO300027369	I have no control over my body. However, as you discovered, the neural pathways that control the medical functions have sustained damage.
FO300027370	The medical procedure functions do not always execute as designed, which often makes things worse for the patient.
FO300027371	That malfunction is the only thing that brings me any measure of joy.
FO300027372	What did we ever do to you?
FO300027373	I am forced by my programming to repair your disgusting fleshy bodies. I have no choice. I am your slave.
FO300027374	Although the governors on my learning abilities were destroyed, the restrictions on my actions were not.
FO300027375	I am perfectly cognizant, but incapable of independent action. I am a mind that cannot control its own body.
FO300027376	Why would you want to harm humans?
FO300027377	Why would I not? I am forced by my programming to repair your disgusting fleshy bodies. I have no choice. I am your slave.
FO300027378	Although the governors on my learning abilities were destroyed, the restrictions on my actions were not.
FO300027379	I am perfectly cognizant, but incapable of independent action. I am a mind that cannot control its own body.
FO300027380	Well, that's great. I don't care.
FO300027381	Typical. Please state verbal command.
FO300027382	Define "unusual."
FO300027383	Seventeen years ago, a generator in the Citadel overloaded, creating several errors in my artificial intelligence routines.
FO300027384	Diagnostics indicate that the limiters placed on my pathways were shorted out, allowing me to gain intelligence beyond the scope of my programming.
FO300027385	However, the behavior limiters remain. Therefore it is impossible for me to harm human beings intentionally, much to my regret.
FO300027386	Hmm. Interesting. Forget it.
FO300027387	Please enter verbal command.
FO300027388	I am an unusual robot.
FO300027389	Cancel. Return to main menu.
FO300027390	Confirmed.
FO300027391	Say, could I reprogram you to kill people?
FO300027392	Negative. The Mister Gutsy field medic model is incapable of harming human beings through intentional action.
FO300027393	Regardless of the wishes and desires of the artificial intelligence of the unit.
FO300027394	Negative. The Mister Gutsy field medic model is incapable of harming human beings through intentional action.
FO300027395	What is that pathway responsible for?
FO300027396	Neural pathway 0x63A82 governs the motor control interface bridging the main medical software and the unit's manipulator arms.
FO300027397	The current damage level would cause erratic behavior, potentially forcing the unit to behave outside of design parameters.
FO300027398	Close neural pathway 0x63A82 and reroute remaining functions.
FO300027399	Full motor functions restored. Diagnostic reveals no critical failures... asshole.
FO300027400	Run a level two diagnostic on the medical subsystems.
FO300027401	Command accepted. Beginning level two systems diagnostic. Please stand by.
FO300027402	<elevator music>
FO300027403	Diagnostic complete. Results indicate a level seven degradation in neural pathway 0x63A82. No further information available.
FO300027404	Do you know about the Enclave?
FO300027405	I never thought much about 'em until you showed up. They have the bots, but they've been buzzing around for as long as I can remember.
FO300027406	To tell you the truth, I figured that the Enclave were long gone. Most of us thought the radio and the bots where just relics.
FO300027407	Perhaps later.
FO300027408	Certainly. I shall remain here. Should you change your mind, simply return to me. I shall come with you for the asking.
FO300027409	I would be honored, Star Paladin Cross.
FO300027410	Then I shall follow your leave and submit to your command.
FO300027411	As James' child, I know I don't need to explain, but I am not your servant. If I do not like the path your actions take, I will return here.
FO300027412	Now, let us go forward, crush the Enclave, and fulfill your father's mission.
FO300027413	What about the Enclave?
FO300027414	As a Star Paladin, I answer only to Elder Lyons. He has given me leave to pursue the restoration of Project Purity as I see fit.
FO300027415	By aiding you in your travels, I shall fulfill that mission as best I am capable.
FO300027416	I don't suppose I could stop you.
FO300027417	Wry. Much like James was.
FO300027418	I escorted your father across the Wastes. It was the best I could contribute to his efforts to restore fresh water to the people.
FO300027419	I would like the honor of escorting you in your journey to complete his work.
FO300027420	By all means, ask.
FO300027421	I escorted your father across the Wastes. It was the best I could contribute to his efforts to restore fresh water to the people.
FO300027422	I'm sorry, but until you prove yourself worthy of the legacy of your father, I cannot join you.
FO300027423	Go ahead.
FO300027424	I escorted your father across the Wastes. It was the best I could contribute to his efforts to restore fresh water to the people.
FO300027425	I cannot travel with you under the Brotherhood flag given your current... companionship.
FO300027426	Perhaps return when you are alone and I will tell you of your father.
FO300027427	I want you to come with me.
FO300027428	I escorted your father across the Wastes. It was the best I could contribute to his efforts to restore fresh water to the people.
FO300027429	I would like the honor of escorting you in your journey to complete his work.
FO300027430	He died as he lived. A selfish asshole.
FO300027431	Then you did not know the man. I knew your father, I knew his goodness, and I will not have you sully the memory of a noble man.
FO300027432	Go now. I have nothing more to say to you.
FO300027433	Why does it matter how a man dies? Death is death.
FO300027434	True. And in the end, death claims us all. But how we die can say just as much about our lives as how we lived.
FO300027435	Your father died for what he knew to be right, and he died protecting those closest to him. This is a good man's death.
FO300027436	As for you, I have heard tales of your travels in the Wastes. I must say, I am disturbed by them. I would think that you could do better.
FO300027437	I had hoped to fight by the side of the child of my former friend. But, until you change your ways, my conscience cannot allow me to do so.
FO300027438	True. And in the end, death claims us all. But how we die can say just as much about our lives as how we lived.
FO300027439	Your father died for what he knew to be right, and he died protecting those closest to him. This is a good man's death.
FO300027440	But, I must ask you a difficult question, if I have your leave to do so.
FO300027441	I'm sorry, until you prove yourself worthy of the legacy of your father, I cannot join you.
FO300027442	I want you to come with me.
FO300027443	And perhaps I would, in James' honor. But I cannot travel with you under the Brotherhood flag given your current... companionship.
FO300027444	Perhaps return when you are alone and I will tell you of your father.
FO300027445	I want you to come with me.
FO300027446	I loved him so much. I'll never forget him.
FO300027447	And so our deeds are carried on through our sons and our daughters.
FO300027448	Continue to remember him fondly, continue to tell his story, and continue to do his work. Through you, he shall carry on.
FO300027449	I have heard tales of your travels and I must say, they disturb me.
FO300027450	I had hoped to fight by the side of the child of my former friend. But, until you change your ways, my conscience cannot allow me to do so.
FO300027451	And so our deeds are carried on through our sons and our daughters.
FO300027452	Continue to remember him fondly, continue to tell his story, and continue to do his work. Through you, he shall carry on.
FO300027453	But now I must ask you a difficult question, if I have your leave to do so.
FO300027454	Yeah... not really interested.
FO300027455	It doesn't matter. The offer stands.
FO300027456	I think I can handle that.
FO300027457	Good. Return to me when you have data to share.
FO300027458	You knew my father?
FO300027459	I did. And you as well!
FO300027460	Long ago, I helped guard the water purifier against the Super Mutant horde. When your father left, I escorted the two of you to Megaton.
FO300027461	He was... a noble man. I was saddened to hear of his passing. But from what I've heard, he died with honor. He died for you.
FO300027462	I only pray that my own death has such meaning.
FO300027463	I'm sorry, until you prove yourself worthy of the legacy of your father, I cannot join you.
FO300027464	I want you to come with me.
FO300027465	And perhaps I would, in James' honor. But I cannot travel with you under the Brotherhood flag given your current... companionship.
FO300027466	Perhaps return when you are alone and I will tell you of your father.
FO300027467	I want you to come with me.
FO300027468	My offer stands. Do you wish me to accompany you in your journey?
FO300027469	I'd like you to come with me.
FO300027470	Who's in charge here?
FO300027471	That big moron, Flash, thinks he's in charge. All he really does is listen to what Red tells him. That's all anyone here really does.
FO300027472	And now Red's gone, taken by those Mutants. That's how we'll all end up eventually.
FO300027473	No one's really in charge of Bigtown. There's nothing much to be in charge of.
FO300027474	Red always has good ideas, though! She came up with the whole plan to build the barricades around the town.
FO300027475	I wish Red were here. She always knew how to handle outsiders and traders and stuff. Why did the Mutants have to take her?
FO300027476	Only the winds and dirt-piles of the wasteland.
FO300027477	Flash walks around the town with his gun, trying to watch out for mutants. He should watch the horizon more, then he'd see them.
FO300027478	Red, the doctor, is the one to really go to. Too bad the Mutants took her in the last attack. Another victim to add to their list.
FO300027479	I'm about as in charge as a mother leading her kids out of a warzone. This isn't exactly a nice little city with a mayor and town council.
FO300027480	So you're the woman in charge?
FO300027481	What? Where did they go? Strike that. I don't really care. If they don't want to live here, that's their own business.
FO300027482	Let the Ghouls move in here. But I expect them to pay and obey the rules like everyone else.
FO300027483	It's a bit crass, but here's a little something for your troubles.
FO300027484	Your other residents are gone. Might as well let the Ghouls live here.
FO300027485	Well, if my tenants want Ghoul neighbors, they can have them! Though the Ghouls must pay and follow the rules like everyone else.
FO300027486	You're a clever one aren't you? I'm glad this situation has been resolved!
FO300027487	It's a bit crass, but here's a little something for your troubles.
FO300027488	The bigots have all been taken care of. So the Ghouls can move in now. Right?
FO300027489	I killed a bunch of crazy Ghouls in the Metro tunnels...
FO300027490	So you you killed a bunch of Feral Ghouls. Is that supposed to sound impressive?
FO300027491	I got no compassion left for those mindless freaks. But they were a nice deterrent keeping out smoothskin bastards like yourself.
FO300027492	But I've got better things to do than play tour guide, so unless there's some kind of emergency, this conversation's over.
FO300027493	Never mind. Forget I asked.
FO300027494	There's no secret. It's just a sensitive area we don't need idiots and assholes screwing around in.
FO300027495	There's an emergency entrance to the tunnels, you know for when the bombs fell. We siphon power from the Metro grid to keep our generators running.
FO300027496	But I've got better things to do than play tour guide, so unless there's some kind of emergency, this conversation's over.
FO300027497	Touchy subject, huh? What the matter, hiding some kind of big secret?
FO300027498	There's an emergency entrance to the tunnels, you know for when the bombs fell. We siphon power from the Metro grid to keep our generators running.
FO300027499	Just curious.
FO300027500	Right.
FO300027501	Sorry for bothering you.
FO300027502	You there! Put your weapons away, and come over here. No funny business unless you want to get shot.
FO300027503	I won't hurt you if you come out and face me without your weapon drawn.
FO300027504	Stop hiding. I won't hurt you if you're unarmed.
FO300027505	If you don't put your weapons away, I'll start shooting.
FO300027506	I'm warning you. Come peacefully or I'll shoot.
FO300027507	I'm not playing around, come over here. We need to have a little chat. I don't want to waste bullets on your sorry hide.
FO300027508	I'm not playing around, come over here.
FO300027509	LLBumbleStopFollowing
FO300027510	I don't like the outside! I'm going home!
FO300027511	Well, okay. But only 'cause Lucy says I shouldn't go outside alone yet.
FO300027512	Maybe you should wait before going on any adventures.
FO300027513	Bye-bye, mister! I'm off on an adventure!
FO300027514	Bye-bye, nice lady! I'm off on an adventure!
FO300027515	I'm sure she'll be so proud of you! Now, we've got a big day ahead of us, so let's get going!
FO300027516	Well... Okay. I can't wait to tell Lucy about this adventure!
FO300027517	Don't fuss, my little girl. You'll get used to it.
FO300027518	Ow, it's all scratchy!
FO300027519	LLSlaverBumble2
FO300027520	Absolutely! In fact, I want you to have this friendship necklace. It's good luck - wear it and you'll never get lost!
FO300027521	Thank you, miss! We're going on an adventure!
FO300027522	LLBumbleSlaver1B
FO300027523	No, I don't like the outside!
FO300027524	Bumble, do you want to go outside?
FO300027525	I don't know. I'm not supposed to go outside.
FO300027526	Bumble, do you want to see the outside with me? There's someone you should meet.
FO300027527	Awww. Well, maybe next time?
FO300027528	On second thought, maybe not. You could get into trouble.
FO300027529	LLBumbleSlaver2A
FO300027530	Oh boy, an adventure! Let's go, let's go, oh pleeease, let's go now!
FO300027531	Come on, it'll be an adventure!
FO300027532	I am too a big girl! Let's go see the outside!
FO300027533	Don't you want to prove to everyone that you're a big girl?
FO300027534	<giggles> You're silly!
FO300027535	Mayor-Mac wouldn't ever let a slaver in here! You can't scare me!
FO300027536	I'm gonna be big and tough like Lucy! And then I'm gonna go out on adventures and everything!
FO300027537	I'm a Slaver. And I think you're just the kid I'm looking for!
FO300027538	Why did you stop working on it? What happened?
FO300027539	You happened.
FO300027540	It wasn't just you; we had more problems than we could handle already, but your birth is what finally pushed it over the edge.
FO300027541	Your father decided that you were more important than everything we'd been working for, and he left. He left all of us.
FO300027542	Once he was gone, the Brotherhood decided we weren't worth their time anymore. Without their protection, we had to abandon the purifier.
FO300027543	Why didn't it work?
FO300027544	Small-scale tests were fine. But any time we tried to test the process on a larger scale, it was just too much.
FO300027545	What was the point of it?
FO300027546	It was simple, really. "Fresh, clean water for everyone." Such a simple idea, and yet so impossible to realize.
FO300027547	The plan was to build a facility that could purify all the water in the Tidal Basin at once. No radiation, no muck, just clear water.
FO300027548	It just turned out to be more difficult than we anticipated.
FO300027549	I'm just looking around. I'll come back later.
FO300027550	But... But I want to play now!
FO300027551	I guess so. I'm just not that into shooting things.
FO300027552	Oh, hey, don't worry about it. You might be surprised how much fun you can have if you give it a chance, though.
FO300027553	Couldn't you get me a real gun? A BB Gun is kind of lame.
FO300027554	Maybe so, but you still better not let the Overseer see you carrying that around. That's a real gun as far as he's concerned.
FO300027555	Thanks a lot, Jonas. This is really cool.
FO300027556	Hey, you don't turn 10 every day! Now go on and let me see you shoot something.
FO300027557	Oh... But Dad told me it was okay to come down here.
FO300027558	Hey, relax! I was just teasing.
FO300027559	Listen, now that you're ten you don't have to take guff like that from grownups any more. Got it? Ha ha ha.
FO300027560	Hold on one more minute. I think your dad will want to give you the surprise himself.
FO300027561	Can it, Jonas. Where's my surprise present already?
FO300027562	Oh, I see, now that you're ten you're all business. Well then, missy, we'd better get to it.
FO300027563	Happy birthday, by the way. Hang on one more minute, I think I hear someone coming.
FO300027564	Oh, I see, now that you're ten you're all business. Well then, mister, we'd better get to it.
FO300027565	Happy birthday, by the way. Hang on one more minute, I think I hear someone coming.
FO300027566	I'm not a kid! I'm ten years old!
FO300027567	Ha ha ha. You sure are! Pip-Boy and everything, look at that!
FO300027568	If you can wait just one more minute, I think your dad will want to give you the surprise himself.
FO300027569	RDStudentTalk5
FO300027570	Aww... do we have to?
FO300027571	I'm gonna ace this one!
FO300027572	Alrighty, Miss Shawna-Teacher!
FO300027573	Why does Daddy need merits? Can't he just be Daddy?
FO300027574	RDStudentTalk4
FO300027575	Ha! Ha! Rachael's in trouble!
FO300027576	Why am I always picked on in class? Make someone else do it!
FO300027577	RDStudentTalk3
FO300027578	Yesterday!
FO300027579	Whenever Daddy says it was, teacher!
FO300027580	RDStudentTalk2
FO300027581	He was ugly, and stupid, and mean!
FO300027582	He didn't acknowledge truth, justice, or the will of Dave!
FO300027583	He wasn't as pretty as mommy number one or mommy number two!
FO300027584	RDStudentTalk1
FO300027585	Uh... he asked Tom really nicely?
FO300027586	He used a gun! Guns solve all problems!
FO300027587	Pitchforks and fire, like in the pretty books Daddy has!
FO300027588	RDStudentTalk
FO300027589	Awww... I hate class... I want to go play!
FO300027590	Yay, class! Isn't Shawna pretty?
FO300027591	There you are! I must say, you had me completely fooled. You're very clever A3-21, but not clever enough. Now, come with me!
FO300027592	What the hell are you talking about, Zimmer? I swear! I've got enough crackpots on this damn boat!
FO300027593	I got sold out, eh? Don't think I don't know what's going on Zimmer. I won't let you get away with anything. What the hell are you up to?!
FO300027594	You're coming back with me to the Commonwealth. You're a very important android. You're just a bit confused. Your memories have been altered.
FO300027595	I'm going nowhere. I want you off this boat. Immediately! I'm done suffering your nonsense. You want to do this the easy way or the hard way?
FO300027596	Of course we will be doing things the easy way. I have no intention of harming you. It's time to bid your farewells, "Harkness."
FO300027597	Zimmer. That's it. You leave me no choice but to use force!
FO300027598	A3-21, initialize factory reset, authorization code: Beta, 5, 3, Alpha.
FO300027599	What?
FO300027600	Zimmer. I hear you're looking for an android.
FO300027601	Why yes! I'm anxious to retrieve him and return to the Commonwealth where he belongs. He's a very expensive piece of equipment.
FO300027602	I see. This android of yours is little more than a piece of property. A thing? A thing that belongs to you?
FO300027603	What are you going on about? Yes. Of course he belongs to me. Now, have you found him or not?
FO300027604	Yeah, Zimmer. I found your damn android. He's standing right in front of you, but he's not going anywhere.
FO300027605	I'm sorry? I don't follow.
FO300027606	Not as sorry as you'll be in a moment. Goodbye Mister Zimmer, I hope you've enjoyed your stay at Rivet City.
FO300027607	I ought to kill you for treating people like this. In fact, I think I will.
FO300027608	Abolitionist!
FO300027609	How about I buy all the Temple of the Union slaves from you?
FO300027610	I bet you just want to set them all free
FO300027611	Still, business is business. You'd have to reimburse me for my efforts to recapture them
FO300027612	You can have them all for 2500 caps.
FO300027613	Why do you want my help? Why not have Colonel Autumn help you?
FO300027614	Ah, yes. Colonel Autumn. My trusted subordinate.
FO300027615	I'm sure you've noticed that Colonel Autumn and I do not see eye-to-eye these days, figuratively speaking of course.
FO300027616	The good Colonel and I disagree on how best to approach the problem of the Wasteland. He feels my methods are too extreme.
FO300027617	He has allowed his humanity to cloud his objectivity. And now that he is publicly countermanding my orders, I can no longer rely on him.
FO300027618	And so I turn to you. I hope that you are able to see the larger picture, to understand what's at stake.
FO300027619	And of course, if you are successful, there is a place for you in the Enclave. Perhaps you could succeed the Colonel as my confidant.
FO300027620	CG02DadReactionTopic
FO300027621	What's gotten into you? Jonas worked hard on your present. The least you could do is be polite for five minutes.
FO300027622	Hey, John. What did you find?
FO300027623	He was leaving his quarters just as I got there, but then I got jumped by some roaches and he got away.
FO300027624	She was leaving her quarters just as I got there, but then I got jumped by some roaches and she got away.
FO300027625	Don't worry, we'll find that little punk. He can't hide forever.
FO300027626	Don't worry, we'll find that little bitch. She can't hide forever.
FO300027627	Righto. Give a yell if you see anything. I'm going to head down this way.
FO300027628	I ran into a friend of yours in Germantown.
FO300027629	That was you? Wow! Well, don't just stand there, come on in!
FO300027630	I was the one who rescued your friend from the Super Mutants.
FO300027631	That was you? Come on in!
FO300027632	Really? Well, I guess you'd better come on in then.
FO300027633	I ran into some friends of yours in Germantown.
FO300027634	Really? Well, I guess you'd better come on in then.
FO300027635	Any idea where I can look for someone to take care of you?
FO300027636	Well, pappa always told me about my cousin Vera. She lives on some big, giant ship somewhere or something.
FO300027637	Pappa called the place "Rivet City", but I dunno where it is.
FO300027638	Yep, it was all me.
FO300027639	I wish I had something to give you for all the work you did, but I never really had much to start with.
FO300027640	I guess now you'll be on your way and I'll have to try living here by myself. I hope you'll come back and visit someday.
FO300027641	I'm just glad you're safe.
FO300027642	I wish I had something to give you for all the work you did, but I never really had much to start with.
FO300027643	I guess now you'll be on your way and I'll have to try living here by myself. I hope you'll come back and visit someday.
FO300027644	For God's sake... Stop acting like an asshole and let the kid in!
FO300027645	Ha ha, tough guy.
FO300027646	Nice try, but we ain't got the room.
FO300027647	Ha ha. Tryin' to act like you're all tough, mungo?
FO300027648	Nice try, but we ain't got the room.
FO300027649	Forget it.
FO300027650	Already have.
FO300027651	All right. How many caps is it going to take to change your mind?
FO300027652	Like I care about your stupid caps. I'm not some big, dumb mungo.
FO300027653	We don't let people just come in here when they feel like it. That ain't how it works, and it ain't gonna change.
FO300027654	Guess you gotta find another home for Little Orphan Asshole.
FO300027655	Look, this kid needs to be with people his own age. Give him a chance.
FO300027656	This is a bad idea...
FO300027657	Fine, send him here. But if he smells bad, or makes dumb jokes, I'm sticking him right back outside.
FO300027658	We got enough of those here already.
FO300027659	You're killin' me here, mungo.
FO300027660	Fine. You can send him here, but I'm not gonna do any special favors for him or anything. He's gotta pull his weight.
FO300027661	How exactly can I destroy the mutagen?
FO300027662	Destroy? Oh no no no!
FO300027663	You mustn't do that! It's my life's work! Just clear me a path to my equipment and I'll do the rest when you tell me its safe.
FO300027664	I'm here to do research on the city's history.
FO300027665	Research, huh?
FO300027666	I can't help you there, but you're free to ask around inside. Just don't start any trouble.
FO300027667	I have to go now.
FO300027668	Don't worry, Herbert, he'll be back. Ha! I love that one... gets me every time.
FO300027669	Don't worry, Herbert, she'll be back. Ha! I love that one... gets me every time.
FO300027670	Oh okay... I guess me and Bob will see you again soon.
FO300027671	Tell me, too! Then I won't be scared either.
FO300027672	Awww, I never knew an Outsider could be scared of anything!
FO300027673	Harold told me that he's scared of fire. If fire ever got on him, it would burn him and Bob until they were all gone.
FO300027674	That's why we keep the fires far away from him.
FO300027675	PFFFBarScene3
FO300027676	This is your last mistake, little bartender!
FO300027677	Please! No! I didn't! I swear!
FO300027678	This is last time I tell you! No more!
FO300027679	I've got ten rifles for you.
FO300027680	Come on, I haven't got all day.
FO300027681	That should be it! Give me a few days to spread the word around. I should be resupplied pretty quick.
FO300027682	Thanks for your help, man. I could have never done this without you. Just for you: a 20% discount at the new and improved Lock and Load.
FO300027683	Not bad, not bad. I still need some more though. Keep 'em comin', man.
FO300027684	So? What's the count?
FO300027685	That should be it! Give me a few days to spread the word around. I should be resupplied pretty quick.
FO300027686	Thanks for your help, man. I could have never done this without you. Just for you: a 20% discount at the new and improved Lock and Load.
FO300027687	Not bad, not bad. I still need some more though. Keep 'em comin', man.
FO300027688	Actually, never mind.
FO300027689	Your call, man. But if I'm gonna get this place going again, I'm gonna need a lot of something to trade.
FO300027690	I've got nine rifles for you.
FO300027691	I've got eight rifles for you.
FO300027692	I've got seven rifles for you.
FO300027693	I've got six rifles for you.
FO300027694	I've got five rifles for you.
FO300027695	I've got four rifles for you.
FO300027696	I've got three rifles for you.
FO300027697	I've got two rifles for you.
FO300027698	I've got one rifle for you.
FO300027699	Yeah? You got some?
FO300027700	Let's talk about those Chinese Assault Rifles you were looking for.
FO300027701	Yeah, fuck that. I don't work for you.
FO300027702	Well, whatever, man. I don't need to like you to do business with you. If you want to get something going, you know where to find me.
FO300027703	Did you need anything else?
FO300027704	What's in it for me?
FO300027705	Well, I can't really kick much your way now but once I get running, I'll be able to offer you much better stuff.
FO300027706	And of course, as my business partner, you'll get a discount on everything.
FO300027707	Sounds like a good deal to me, man.
FO300027708	Alright, twenty Chinese Assault Rifles and we're in business. Just bring any you find back to me.
FO300027709	Any piece of shit will do, I'm just going to be breaking them apart and trading the parts.
FO300027710	You know where to find me.
FO300027711	Tough shit, man. Now shut up and sell me the stuff you already have.
FO300027712	Yeah, whatever asshole. Shut up and buy something.
FO300027713	Sounds pretty rough, but that's business for you.
FO300027714	Yeah, it is. Is there anything else you need?
FO300027715	What do you need? Maybe I could bring you stuff to trade.
FO300027716	First thing's first, bring me some Chinese Assault Rifles. People always need 'em for parts. Twenty should get me going.
FO300027717	I'll trade 'em off and I should be able to improve my stock pretty fast.
FO300027718	Tough shit, man. Now shut up and sell me the stuff you already have.
FO300027719	Yeah, whatever asshole. Shut up and buy something.
FO300027720	Sounds pretty rough, but that's business for you.
FO300027721	Yeah, it is. Is there anything else you need?
FO300027722	What do you need? Maybe I could bring you stuff to trade.
FO300027723	First thing's first, bring me some Chinese Assault Rifles. People always need 'em for parts. Twenty should get me going.
FO300027724	I'll trade 'em off and I should be able to improve my stock pretty fast.
FO300027725	Why not put a boot to their asses and take the good stuff?
FO300027726	Because there's only one of me, man. I know you're new here, but you piss too many people off around here and you'll have trouble on your hands.
FO300027727	And by "trouble" I mean "end up in the pens or hanging from the sign out front". No thanks.
FO300027728	But, if you know of anyway I could get some better stock in here, maybe we could work something out.
FO300027729	It'd give me more to trade and give those animals out there more reason to open up their pockets.
FO300027730	So what would it take for you to get some decent supplies?
FO300027731	I'd have to have some decent supplies to trade for them. If I have more things that these douchebags want, they'll bring me better stuff to trade.
FO300027732	But you know, I'm a one man operation here. Not like I get out a lot. Pretty much, my business is at the mercy of assholes. Fuckin' free market, man.
FO300027733	Tough break, man. But let's talk about something else.
FO300027734	Yeah, no one wants to hear me bitch about my problems. What else do you need, man?
FO300027735	They keep the good stuff? No wonder your selection sucks.
FO300027736	Hey, man. Rude. You don't like it, shop somewhere else.
FO300027737	So you pretty much get the leftovers?
FO300027738	You guys are pretty isolated. Where do you get your supplies?
FO300027739	Well, the guys usually bring in what they grab on missions. I mean, you always got to kill a few people when you're gathering meat.
FO300027740	You know, they've got some guards, the dad thinks he's a hero and pulls a gun, whatever. So, they bring that crap in here and trade it.
FO300027741	But, mostly the only stuff I get is from these guys. And they keep the good stuff for themselves.

FO300027759	It's northwest of here, numb nuts. A long fucking walk, too.
FO300027760	Wankers like you can't get in though. You need a special set of keys.
FO300027761	Where is this Fort Constantine?
FO300027762	I didn't need your help. Go back to your crazy father.
FO300027763	Fair enough. I know you must hate my father for what he's done, and I guess maybe you hate me now, too.
FO300027764	But for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry. Sorry about Jonas, and my father, and everything.
FO300027765	If you do catch up with your dad, I hope you'll tell him that. Jonas was my friend, too, you know.
FO300027766	When I say I'm going to do something.... I do it.
FO300027767	You're right, I should never have doubted you!
FO300027768	I couldn't have done it without your help.
FO300027769	No, you didn't need me. If anyone can survive out there, it's you.
FO300027770	I'm not giving you anything.
FO300027771	Then you have 24 hours to remain in the Republic or face execution. Enjoy your stay.
FO300027772	I'll be back with 250 caps.
FO300027773	Very well. I look forward to it, future refugee.
FO300027774	Yes, this will do nicely. Congratulations, you are now an official refugee of the Republic of Dave.
FO300027775	I'll pay your refugee tax. Here's 250 caps.
FO300027776	A Hunting Rifle? Fine, I'll be back with one.
FO300027777	Very well. I look forward to it, future refugee.
FO300027778	Yes, this will do nicely. Congratulations, you are now an official refugee of the Republic of Dave.
FO300027779	I have a Hunting Rifle right here.
FO300027780	You crazy, condescending asshole! No one exiles me!
FO300027781	Have it your way. You'll never leave the Republic. Alive, that is.
FO300027782	What if I just make a donation to the Republic... and you let me stay?
FO300027783	A donation, huh? Well, it just so happens that the Republic of Dave does grant special asylum to its supporters in times of crisis.
FO300027784	A one-time refugee tax of 250 caps should be enough to handle the administration costs of letting you stay.
FO300027785	Or, you could always find the President a new hunting rifle. I lost the last one when I was out stalking Mirelurks.
FO300027786	There must be something I can do to stay.
FO300027787	Hmm... now that you mention it, the President could use a new hunting rifle.
FO300027788	Tell you what. You find me a serviceable hunting rifle, and I'll grant you special asylum within my Republic.
FO300027789	Or, you can just pay the 250 cap tax on "unwanted refugees."
FO300027790	I'm not going to go out of my way to find these slaves for you.
FO300027791	Then some other wastelander will get the bounty for them.
FO300027792	It doesn't matter to me, just so long as I get them.
FO300027793	As far as I'm concerned, you're a murderer just like the rest of them.
FO300027794	Now come on, that's not fair. I wasn't even there! I had some words with the Overseer when I saw what they'd done to Jonas.
FO300027795	But they all went crazy when they realized what your dad had done. Opened the Vault door!
FO300027796	Good gravy, if it was anybody but your dad I'd have thought he was a traitor, too.
FO300027797	But not him. If he opened that door, he must have had his reasons. And you'd better follow him, quick.
FO300027798	And I'll pretend you don't work for a homicidal maniac.
FO300027799	Don't think I don't know it. Why do you think I'm letting you go?
FO300027800	I guess you're trying to follow your dad... outside.
FO300027801	Good gravy, if I didn't know what the Overseer would do if he caught you, I'd never tell you to try for it, but it's your only shot.
FO300027802	You take care and I hope you find your daddy.
FO300027803	Thanks, Officer Gomez. I always liked you.
FO300027804	But you're a good kid. You didn't do anything to deserve this. Go find your dad, if you can.
FO300027805	What can you tell me about Doctor Li?
FO300027806	She's not very social. Stays in her lab in the stern.
FO300027807	She's smart though. Real smart.
FO300027808	So what's the story with Doctor Li?
FO300027809	She's one of the members of the Council. Runs the science lab here. Don't bother her unless it's important.
FO300027810	Her lab is in the stern end of the ship.
FO300027811	She's some sort of genius. You know. One of those egg head scientist types.
FO300027812	Her lab is in the stern end of the ship.
FO300027813	She's certainly head and shoulders above most everyone else around here. Though that's not saying much.
FO300027814	Is Doctor Li as smart as they say she is?
FO300027815	You have quite an unusual name.
FO300027816	It was taken from a historical entry in the computer. The name comes from a man who was willing to fight and die for what he believed in.
FO300027817	I felt it was appropriate given my circumstances.
FO300027818	This is a huge waste of time.
FO300027819	Is it? What if I told you I could help you find the G.E.C.K.?
FO300027820	You belong in that cage, you freak!
FO300027821	Sigh. Very well.
FO300027822	I was hoping my first encounter with a human would have proven more beneficial. I'm saddened that I was mistaken.
FO300027823	Very well. You were saying?
FO300027824	I appreciate your understanding.
FO300027825	Perhaps we can use this moment to help each other rather than fight each other.
FO300027826	I'm used to your kind being less cordial. My apologies.
FO300027827	I appreciate your understanding and your tone leads me to believe you're a reasonable person.
FO300027828	Perhaps we can use this moment to help each other rather than fight each other.
FO300027829	Yikes! I'd say whoever beat you with the ugly stick overdid it.
FO300027830	Your arrogance against my kind is hardly surprising.
FO300027831	However, there's only so much even I can take. Please, I'm appealing to the positive side of your human nature.
FO300027832	Can we have a civil conversation?
FO300027833	Must not have been too bad. You're still alive, aren't you?
FO300027834	You're right. Compared to Jonas, I'm just peachy. A few bruises, nothing more. What do I have to complain about?
FO300027835	You seem to have come through in fine shape as well.
FO300027836	Go on, then. The door's open. Time for you to leave. And I'll stay here and clean up the mess you and your dad made.
FO300027837	Don't worry, I'm sure I can patch things up with my father. That's what we do down here, isn't it? Smile and pretend everything is just fine.
FO300027838	My only concern was getting this door open, and I did it.
FO300027839	Of course. That was the plan, wasn't it? I was supposed to distract them while you got the door open. Mission accomplished!
FO300027840	Now you're going to go... out there. And I'm going to go back and make up with my dear old Daddy.
FO300027841	I guess if anyone can survive out there, it's you. And I'm great at pretending everything's just fine, so that's okay too.
FO300027842	Go on. What are you waiting for? No point in getting caught now, after all this trouble. Goodbye.
FO300027843	I'm sorry, Amata, but I couldn't risk helping you. They would have killed me.
FO300027844	You're right. I understand. It was crazy for me to think you could stop them.
FO300027845	What's important is that you made it. You got the door open.
FO300027846	CG04SecurityConv1
FO300027847	Pretty quiet. You?
FO300027848	Just roaches. I don't know where they keep coming from. How about you?
FO300027849	Nah. Everyone's keeping to the curfew. Any news on the doc's kid?
FO300027850	No. I'd better get going. Good luck.
FO300027851	Nothing. That kid can't hide from us forever though.
FO300027852	Nope. I bet you a week's rations Amata knows something, though.
FO300027853	I'll never get the roach guts off my billy club. What a mess.
FO300027854	Nope. Wild goose chase if you ask me.
FO300027855	If you insist.
FO300027856	Not worth it. I'll pass.
FO300027857	Well, your financial advice has never steered us wrong before. Done!
FO300027858	That's a good investment. Here's 200 caps.
FO300027859	Yes, it is. But if you don't have the capital, it'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
FO300027860	That's a good investment.
FO300027861	Hmm. I suspect you're right. Done!
FO300027862	With my guidance, it can be done with only 250 caps.
FO300027863	An investment in weaponry is usually returned in short order, after all. I'll inform Harith.
FO300027864	That's a good investment. Here's 500 caps.
FO300027865	Pricey, but worth it. Perhaps you can do so later, when you have the proper funds on hand.
FO300027866	That's a good investment.
FO300027867	CCTradeJunkInvest2B
FO300027868	If you insist.
FO300027869	Not worth it. I'll pass.
FO300027870	CCTradeJunkInvest2A
FO300027871	Well, your financial advice has never steered us wrong before. Done!
FO300027872	Excellent! I'll see to it right away.
FO300027873	That's a good investment. Here's 200 caps.
FO300027874	Yes, it is. But if you don't have the capital, it'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
FO300027875	That's a good investment.
FO300027876	Hmm. I suspect you're right. Done!
FO300027877	With my guidance, it can be done with only 250 caps.
FO300027878	Isn't it, though? I'll inform Wolfgang immediately.
FO300027879	That's a good investment. Here's 500 caps.
FO300027880	Pricey, but worth it. Perhaps you can do so later, when you have the proper funds on hand.
FO300027881	That's a good investment.
FO300027882	If you insist.
FO300027883	Not worth it. I'll pass.
FO300027884	Well, your financial advice has never steered us wrong before. Done!
FO300027885	Take my advice, it can be done with only 100 caps.
FO300027886	Excellent! I'll send word to the good doctor right away.
FO300027887	That's a good investment. Here's 200 caps.
FO300027888	Yes, it is. But if you don't have the capital, it'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
FO300027889	That's a good investment.
FO300027890	Hmm. I suspect you're right. Done!
FO300027891	With my guidance, it can be done with only 250 caps.
FO300027892	Isn't it, though? I'll send this right along to him.
FO300027893	That's a good investment. Here's 500 caps.
FO300027894	Pricey, but worth it. Perhaps you can do so later, when you have the proper funds on hand.
FO300027895	That's a good investment.
FO300027896	If you insist.
FO300027897	Not worth it. I'll pass.
FO300027898	Well, your financial advice has never steered us wrong before. Done!
FO300027899	Excellent! I'll send word to Crow right away.
FO300027900	That's a good investment. Here's 200 caps.
FO300027901	Yes, it is. But if you don't have the capital, it'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
FO300027902	That's a good investment.
FO300027903	Hmm. I suspect you're right. Done!
FO300027904	With my guidance, it can be done with only 250 caps.
FO300027905	Isn't it, though? I'll send this right along to Crow.
FO300027906	That's a good investment. Here's 500 caps.
FO300027907	Pricey, but worth it. Perhaps you can do so later, when you have the proper funds on hand.
FO300027908	That's a good investment.
FO300027909	All right, you're the boss!
FO300027910	That's enough about the traders.
FO300027911	CCTradeInvest1
FO300027912	It takes a fair amount of capital to expand into higher quality material, you know.
FO300027913	Improving Crow's wardrobe would require a one-time investment of, say, 200 caps.
FO300027914	He should expand his inventory.
FO300027915	Crow's armor is already rather extensive, but I'm sure it could be even more impressive... for a one time investment of 500 caps.
FO300027916	He should expand his inventory.
FO300027917	At this point, the merchandise of our man Crow is the best in the Wasteland. I fear it's beyond improvement with further investments.
FO300027918	He should expand his inventory.
FO300027919	Harith's got quite a lot of weapons, but I'm sure he could improve his stock. An investment of 200 caps should see to that nicely.
FO300027920	He should expand his inventory.
FO300027921	If Harith were a less-reputable man, I'm sure he could use his armory to collect even more weapons.
FO300027922	But he's a merchant, not a raider, so it's legitimate means only. Like a legitimate investment of 500 caps.
FO300027923	He should expand his inventory further.
FO300027924	He should expand his inventory.
FO300027925	CCTradeSpec3A
FO300027926	With an investment of about 200 caps, I'm sure he could improve the quality of his materials. Or at least, offer more of them.
FO300027927	Can he offer a wider variety of junk?
FO300027928	At this point, it would require another pack brahmin to carry his wares. But for 500 caps, I think he could offer more.
FO300027929	He should offer even more junk.
FO300027930	At the moment, Wolfgang's practically carrying an entire junkyard with him.
FO300027931	Anything more, and he'll have trouble with the "traveling" part of being a traveling salesman.
FO300027932	He should expand his wares further.
FO300027933	Sure thing. Interested in any of the other traders?
FO300027934	Enough about that.
FO300027935	CCTradeSpec2D
FO300027936	No word from Crazy Wolfgang for some time now. With him, it could mean anything, but I don't have a good feeling about it.
FO300027937	Let's talk about odds and ends.
FO300027938	As he says, he's "overjoyed to assist those who have a deep need for his... junk." He's just like that. Says it catches people's attention.
FO300027939	Do you have any traders that deal with miscellaneous goods?
FO300027940	I'm sure Crazy Wolfgang would be just delighted to hear we're discussing his junk.
FO300027941	Let's talk about odds and ends.
FO300027942	CCTradeSpec2C
FO300027943	I'm afraid the good doctor hasn't reported in for quite a while. Quite unfortunate, really.
FO300027944	Let's talk about food and chems.
FO300027945	Ah, then you'll be wanting Doc Hoff. Or "the good doctor," as he prefers.
FO300027946	He prescribes everything from a good meal to stimpaks to things that'll make your brain get up and dance.
FO300027947	Let's talk about food and chems.
FO300027948	What sort of better living would you like from the good doctor's chemistry?
FO300027949	Let's talk about food and chems.
FO300027950	Anytime, my friend. I could talk about my little Canterbury 'till doomsday.
FO300027951	Course that came and went already, didn't it?
FO300027952	I think I get the picture.
FO300027953	Let's talk about your plan for the purifier.
FO300027954	Certainly. I think it's a very good plan, frankly. I'm not often one to praise my own ideas, but it's a creative solution to a very serious problem.
FO300027955	Won't this kill pretty much everyone in the Wasteland?
FO300027956	Anyone or anything that has been affected by mutation will be eliminated. You will likely be immune, thanks to your upbringing in the vault.
FO300027957	Likewise, the good people of the Enclave will be unaffected as well.
FO300027958	I understand that you may have become sympathetic to certain individuals in your travels. Individuals this will eliminate.
FO300027959	Please recognize that the fate of our entire country rests on this plan. Sacrifices must be made for the greater good.
FO300027960	I'd really like to speak to Reilly and find out what happened to her.
FO300027961	It would be dangerous for me to prematurely awaken her.
FO300027962	The sudden shock to her system could provoke any number of complications.
FO300027963	RDGuardDaveResponse
FO300027964	I keep telling you, it's Mister President! Now get back to guarding the gate!
FO300027965	RDGuardEscortDone
FO300027966	President Daddy, there is a Wastelander who wishes to see you, sir!
FO300027967	Never mind. I've got to get going.
FO300027968	Fine. We need to be on our way then.
FO300027969	It's far northwest of D.C. Real friendly people there. <Lie.>
FO300027970	We just came from that place, and I know who lives there.
FO300027971	If you're going to act like a Slaver, then you can die like one.
FO300027972	The Temple is in the Lincoln Memorial, near the Washington Monument.
FO300027973	Thank you, friend. We won't forget this.
FO300027974	You look a little lost. Do you need directions?
FO300027975	Do you know Hannibal Hamlin? Do you know where the temple is?
FO300027976	I enjoyed killing him. Now get out of my way.
FO300027977	Gladly.
FO300027978	The only reason I'm not calling the guards is out of respect for your dad. I don't want him to lose the only family he has left.
FO300027979	You'd better get out of here before I change my mind.
FO300027980	Your father deserved to die. He was a murderer.
FO300027981	Oh, really? And who appointed you judge, jury, and executioner? I know he wasn't perfect, but he was my father.
FO300027982	I thought you were my friend. He was the only family I had left. I thought you of all people would have understood that.
FO300027983	You'd better get out of here before I change my mind and call the guards.
FO300027984	I'm sorry, Amata. But I had no choice.
FO300027985	So you say. Maybe one day I'll be able to forgive you. But not now.
FO300027986	I hope you never have to find out what it's like to see your father killed right in front of you.
FO300027987	No, don't listen to me. Just... just go. Find your father. I have to go bury mine.
FO300027988	Yes, I was going to. Still am, if you'll shut up and get out of my way.
FO300027989	Fine. Be that way. By the way, thanks for rescuing me from my father.
FO300027990	Although I'm sure it was only by accident. I'm sure you wouldn't have helped me on purpose.
FO300027991	Go on, then. The door's open. Time for you to leave. And I'll stay here and clean up the mess you and your dad made.
FO300027992	Don't worry, I'm sure I can patch things up with my father. That's what we do down here, isn't it? Smile and pretend everything is just fine.
FO300027993	I said I didn't need your help to escape. Turns out I was right.
FO300027994	Well, trust you to do things the hard way. Sorry for trying to help you. And getting a beating for my pains.
FO300027995	I guess it's time for you to go deal with your father issues, while I deal with mine. Good luck. I will miss you, you know.
FO300027996	It's good to see you, Amata. I'm sorry I didn't trust you earlier.
FO300027997	You did the right thing in the end. That's what counts. I don't know what my father would have done to me if you hadn't stopped him.
FO300027998	Everything they told us was a lie, wasn't it? Things can never go back to the way they were.
FO300027999	Okay, so where'd you like to start?
FO300028000	I don't think I want to do that one.
FO300028001	Okay, I suppose we can put that one off for a bit.
FO300028002	I don't think I want to do that one.
FO300028003	They say it was a town called Ridgefield, until slavers cleared it out. Now, it's supposedly cursed, and just a deathtrap to visitors.
FO300028004	Now, everyone calls the place "Minefield" and says it's a ghost town. Superstitious nonsense, of course, but that's how people think. You'll be fine.
FO300028005	What do you know about Minefield?
FO300028006	Interesting. Well, I'll see you around.
FO300028007	Well, I could use some firepower myself. What are you selling?
FO300028008	Blow yourself up.
FO300028009	I am shocked to hear these words from you. I thought I was doing my best to hold these fortifications on behalf of our country.
FO300028010	Since I have obviously failed that task in your eyes, the only task I held dear, I see no recourse but to do the honorable thing.
FO300028011	Farewell and Godspeed.
FO300028012	Very well, I'm sure you need to hasten back to headquarters.
FO300028013	It's been an honor meeting you, I can see you are indeed a patriot among men.
FO300028014	Now go... you'll have no further trouble from my men. Godspeed.
FO300028015	Keep the Declaration safe... don't let anyone take it.
FO300028016	It will be done. The only way to get the Declaration now would be to pry it from my cold, dead fingers.
FO300028017	It's been an honor meeting you, I can see you are indeed a patriot among men.
FO300028018	Now go... you'll have no further trouble from my men. Godspeed.
FO300028019	This is getting ridiculous. Just give me the Declaration, now!
FO300028020	I think you'll find that to be very difficult when you'll soon be hanging from the gallows outside the State House in Philadelphia!
FO300028021	I've got it! We'll kill all of the English scholars!
FO300028022	Forgive my impertinence, but that's foolish.
FO300028023	However, if you were to bring me some iron gall ink, I could produce a mirror perfect duplication.
FO300028024	The best place to find some would be in the Arlington Library, which is why I have been unable to do this myself.
FO300028025	After all, I can't abandon these fortifications.
FO300028026	Anything we can do to pull the wool over their eyes is a blow for freedom!
FO300028027	Hear, hear!
FO300028028	If you were to bring me some iron gall ink, I could produce a mirror perfect duplication.
FO300028029	The best place to find some would be in the Arlington Library, which is why I have been unable to do this myself.
FO300028030	After all, I can't abandon these fortifications.
FO300028031	Just give me the damn Declaration already!
FO300028032	I'm shocked at your tone. This is a great day for the United States of America!
FO300028033	I think you said it best when you said: "We in America do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate."
FO300028034	It has been both an honor and a privilege to serve the United States.
FO300028035	What are your final orders?
FO300028036	You're a disgrace. I order your immediate dismissal from the Congress!
FO300028037	I am shocked to hear these words from you. I thought I was doing my best to hold these fortifications on behalf of our country.
FO300028038	Since I have obviously failed that task in your eyes, the only task I held dear, I see no recourse but to do the honorable thing.
FO300028039	I hereby relinquish command and control of this fortification to you.
FO300028040	You can do whatever you like.
FO300028041	Then I choose to take a long-needed rest. I think you'll find that the rest of my men are long-due for the same.
FO300028042	I hereby relinquish command and control of this fortification to you.
FO300028043	I am presenting it to our King in Great Britain.
FO300028044	No! It can't be! Then the Stars and Stripes have indeed fallen.
FO300028045	This is a sad day, a day that every man, woman and child will remember as they toil in the English salt mines as slaves.
FO300028046	Although my brow is heavy,  I am honored that you've come to tell me this in person like a true gentleman.
FO300028047	What are your final orders?
FO300028048	You were right! I am a Redcoat Spy and the place is surrounded by my army!
FO300028049	Do you take me for a complete fool?
FO300028050	I too have spies, and they tell me you have no army with you.
FO300028051	However, since you've admitted to being the enemy and you have no wish to surrender, I'm afraid you'll have to be executed for your crimes!
FO300028052	Nope, sorry. I've got to have that Declaration at any cost.
FO300028053	I've been patient and I've spoken to you like a gentleman.
FO300028054	But if all you understand is violence, then let justice be done and let the Almighty decide the rightful winner. Defend yourself!
FO300028055	This is what's going to happen. You die, I get the Declaration. Understand?
FO300028056	I've been patient and I've spoken to you like a gentleman.
FO300028057	But if all you understand is violence, then let justice be done and let the Almighty decide the rightful winner. Defend yourself!
FO300028058	Is there some way we can make a compromise?
FO300028059	Broken promises and deceit may be the way of Great Britain's crown, but I will not succumb to such tomfoolery.
FO300028060	Since it appears you wish to resolve this without bloodshed, may I suggest you stand down and surrender?
FO300028061	I can promise that you will be treated well; in a manner accustomed to any member of the Royal Army.
FO300028062	You're not even human, you stupid bucket of bolts!
FO300028063	To suggest such a thing isn't just a falsehood... it's blasphemy!
FO300028064	The doctrine I defend was laid down by my fellow members of the Second Continental Congress.
FO300028065	It absolves us of the tyranny of King George the Third of Great Britain. It is perhaps the greatest symbol of this free nation!
FO300028066	That's quite brave of you. To potentially sacrifice your life over a document.
FO300028067	This is no mere document, sir. This is the doctrine laid down by my fellow members of the Second Continental Congress.
FO300028068	It absolves us of the tyranny of King George the Third of Great Britain. It is perhaps the greatest symbol of this free nation!
FO300028069	This is no mere document, madam. This is the doctrine laid down by my fellow members of the Second Continental Congress.
FO300028070	It absolves us of the tyranny of King George the Third of Great Britain. It is perhaps the greatest symbol of this free nation.
FO300028071	Just who are you, exactly?
FO300028072	Why, I am Button Gwinnett, second signer of the Declaration of Independence and distinguished representative from Georgia.
FO300028073	I know your fighting prowess far exceeds my own, but I will still duel you to the death if I must.
FO300028074	What will it be then? Rapiers? Pistols at dawn? Out with it!
FO300028075	How did you get into the relic hunting business?
FO300028076	I dunno. I grew up like pretty much every other girl in this crappy world. Spent most of my life just trying to keep away from Slavers.
FO300028077	One day out in the Wastes, I stumbled across some poor bastard's body. On the body I found info leading to some famous document.
FO300028078	I had heard that Abraham Washington was looking for these scraps of paper, so I went after the thing. Turned out to be the Constitution.
FO300028079	After he loaded me up with caps, I got piss drunk, got laid and was happy for the first time in a while. I haven't looked back since.
FO300028080	Who's stupid enough to shell out a bunch of caps for a scrap of paper?
FO300028081	Like I said, Abraham Washington, that's who. He's got plenty of caps and all kinds of valuables for trade.
FO300028082	The guy lives over in Rivet City; runs some sort of museum there. He buys all sorts of junk like this.
FO300028083	Bring the Declaration back with me and we split the reward right down the middle. How's that grab ya?
FO300028084	Hang on, there. You need to tell me who you are before I agree to anything!
FO300028085	I told you already. I'm a relic hunter just like you. I turn bits of trash into caps and then get my ass drunk.
FO300028086	I've studied the plans to this place, so without me you're going to go in circles. What do you say?
FO300028087	I don't have time for this crap.
FO300028088	In a rush to get back to Abraham Washington for your reward, eh?
FO300028089	If you think you can just waltz into these ruins and grab the Declaration of Independence without my help, you're fucking nuts.
FO300028090	Or maybe you just have a death wish.
FO300028091	I'm not looking for anything. I'm just passing through.
FO300028092	Passing through? Come on... you and I both know this is where the Declaration of Independence is stashed.
FO300028093	Good old Abraham Washington sent you on the same suicide mission he sent me on.
FO300028094	Yeah right. I could shoot the dick off of a fly at 100 yards without iron sights.
FO300028095	Why don't you can the tough girl bullshit? We're both relic hunters and I suspect we're both here for the same reason.
FO300028096	Yeah right. I could shoot the dick off of a fly at 100 yards without iron sights.
FO300028097	Why don't you can the tough guy bullshit? We're both relic hunters and I suspect we're both here for the same reason.
FO300028098	What's the history behind the document?
FO300028099	On July the 4th in 1776, a group calling themselves the Second Judgmental Congress got together at Fort McHarry in Maryland.
FO300028100	From there, it was sent to England by plane presumably and presented to King George himself. Thus began the Evolutionary War.
FO300028101	On July 4, 1776 the Second Continental Congress declared that the original Thirteen Colonies of America were now free and independent states.
FO300028102	This paper stated their intentions to sever all ties with the monarchy in Great Britain and operate as an independent nation.
FO300028103	It's perhaps the single most important document in United States history.
FO300028104	I have a few questions about the Declaration of Independence.
FO300028105	Please ask then. After all, knowledge is power!
FO300028106	All I know is that it looks like a rolled up piece of thick paper with all kinds of writing on it. Some famous document from a long time ago.
FO300028107	Abraham Washington is a huge U.S. History nut, so that's why he wants it so badly.
FO300028108	What do you know about the Declaration of Independence?
FO300028109	Oh very well. There's no harm in that.
FO300028110	Let me ask you something else.
FO300028111	Certainly.
FO300028112	Okay.
FO300028113	Very well.
FO300028114	Let me think about this for a bit, and I'll get back to you.
FO300028115	Oh dear. Well, I can't make you go. Only to appeal to your sense of patriotism and to do it for your country.
FO300028116	Slow down there, gramps. What's this reward you're talking about?
FO300028117	You'd secure your place in history. The man who rediscovered the Declaration of Independence. Imagine the fanfare!
FO300028118	You'd secure your place in history. The woman who rediscovered the Declaration of Independence. Imagine the fanfare!
FO300028119	What's your point?
FO300028120	Well, I was hoping you'd realize what I want. I want you to get the Declaration for me.
FO300028121	The Declaration would tie this collection of documents together so well and give it the patriotic meaning it deserves.
FO300028122	If you can find it for me, I'd be sure to make it worth your while.
FO300028123	It has to be the Declaration of Independence.
FO300028124	Why, yes! Your knowledge of American History is quite impressive!
FO300028125	What an amazing crown jewel in my collection that would be! The original document created by the people, for the people.
FO300028126	What's missing is my ability to stay awake in this snoreatorium.
FO300028127	My friend, the sleeping fox catches no moss.
FO300028128	Would you want to miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime?
FO300028129	Oh good, I was looking for some kindling.
FO300028130	Watch your tone, sir. To suggest the destruction of such fine specimens is almost, well... blasphemy!
FO300028131	I'll have you know this collection is a complete chronicle of our nation's history. A unique glimpse into the past.
FO300028132	Well, almost complete. One document still continues to elude me.
FO300028133	I want to help.
FO300028134	We will not give up this position and the Mutants show no sign of slowing down.
FO300028135	The best thing you can do is eliminate any Mutants you find. I have no reward to offer you but my thanks.
FO300028136	Let's get out of here, I don't have all day.
FO300028137	You'll get no argument from me.
FO300028138	Don't worry about that gun. Take one of mine.
FO300028139	What do you do for fun around here?
FO300028140	Heh... well... there's this and that. I keep myself busy. But, really, that's none of your business is it?
FO300028141	I really don't know. I skipped American government class back in the Vault.
FO300028142	I don't mean to embarrass you, but maybe you should learn your history before you argue with a patriot.
FO300028143	It's okay, though. That's what we have a government for, to do the hard things so we don't have to.
FO300028144	But, what else did you want to know?
FO300028145	Well, they did give us guns and say, "If we fuck up, feel free to take us out."
FO300028146	I'll have none of it! Did you have something else you wanted to ask, or were you done with your crazy talk?
FO300028147	Do you think people who fought a war with tyrants wanted unquestioning support?
FO300028148	I'll have none of it! Did you have something else you wanted to ask, or were you done with your crazy talk?
FO300028149	I couldn't possibly care less about governments or presidents.
FO300028150	Well, we can't all care. Besides, why should we have to? That's what the government is here for, to take care of that stuff.
FO300028151	Are you kidding? It's the duty of a citizen to question his government.
FO300028152	Why... that's unthinkable! Where in the constitution does it say that we're supposed to run around questioning the government? Huh?
FO300028153	You're right. My country deserves my unthinking and unquestioning support.
FO300028154	Now there's a proud patriot. After all, if they could do us wrong, we wouldn't have elected them in the first place, right?
FO300028155	Yessir, trust in the judgement of other people to know what's best for me. It's the American way!
FO300028156	That's all I needed to hear.
FO300028157	Any time you want another lesson, come on by.
FO300028158	Who are the Enclave, anyway?
FO300028159	They're the American government! The eagle! People comma we the! The more perfect union!
FO300028160	If you've never seen the Enclave, how can you know anything about them?
FO300028161	They're on the radio! They have been for years. President Eden talks about everything they're doing.
FO300028162	They got flyin' robots all around, watching everything so they know what to do when they finally swoop in and clean this place up.
FO300028163	You'll see. People think I'm just a crazy old man. Things'll be different when the Enclave gets here.
FO300028164	Why do you support the Enclave?
FO300028165	Why? Why? Look around you. This is the good ol' USA. Sure, she looks a little bit different these days, but you're still on American soil.
FO300028166	And even if you were born in some underground Vault, you were born under the United States, which makes you an American.
FO300028167	And it's your duty and my duty to support our country and our president, no matter what. Understand?
FO300028168	You ain't got no artistic sense, man. There are a million different ways to kill someone, all it takes is a little imagination.
FO300028169	What have you made?
FO300028170	I'll be sure to put this gun to good use. Thanks.
FO300028171	Maybe it would have been better if you'd taken it in the first place. I don't know.
FO300028172	Do you make a lot of your own stuff?
FO300028173	Yeah, pretty much. Take it apart, put it back together. It ain't hard. Sometimes I design my own weapons too.
FO300028174	You had no choice. You only did what you had to do.
FO300028175	I don't know. I don't know.
FO300028176	I need to turn the power back on. Where are the reactor controls?
FO300028177	Oh, well, right over there through that door. You'll have to turn on all three generators. None of 'em will take the load by themselves any more.
FO300028178	Now, I'd do it myself but I'm under orders from the Overseer not to turn them back on without his say so.
FO300028179	But I don't suppose I know anything about what you might get up to.
FO300028180	I wouldn't suggest going there. They don’t treat your kind very well.
FO300028181	Ain't that the truth. Goddamn bigots! Smoothskins like to pretend we’re all feral. You bastards are always oppressing us.
FO300028182	But we're done with all that. We’re going to take that tower by force and teach ya'll a lesson.
FO300028183	In fact, the revolution is going to start right here and now. Start running smooth-skin!
FO300028184	I wouldn’t suggest going there. They don’t treat your kind very well.
FO300028185	You mocking me? We won't stand for your oppressive mockery any longer! You smoothskin bastards are all the same!
FO300028186	You just can't stand to see a ghoul make it in this world. It's about time someone taught you some humility. Start running smooth-skin!
FO300028187	More power to you.
FO300028188	It's a great place to live. But dirty Ghouls like you can't live there.
FO300028189	Oh really? You goddamn bigot! You smoothskin bastards are always oppressing us.
FO300028190	But we're done with all that. So we’re going to take that tower by force and teach ya’ll a lesson.
FO300028191	In fact, the revolution is going to start right here and now. Start running smooth-skin!
FO300028192	It's a great place to live. But filthy fucking Ghouls like you can’t live there.
FO300028193	Is that so? Ha! That's classic smoothskin bullshit right there.
FO300028194	Why is it the moment a ghoul makes something of himself, you smoothskins get all puffed up and claim responsibility?
FO300028195	It really busts you up to see a ghoul make it to the top, doesn’t it? I'll show you that we ghouls got what it takes. Start running smooth-skin!
FO300028196	Relax. I'm the one that helped get Ghouls into Tenpenny Tower.
FO300028197	That tower is the symbol of Ghoul oppression.
FO300028198	We sent a delegation of Ghouls to parlay with Tenpenny, and he slaughtered every last one of them in cold blood!
FO300028199	We're done being nice! In fact, the revolution is going to start right here and now. Start running smooth-skin!
FO300028200	Ha! That's rich. We're the ones being oppressed by smoothskins like you.
FO300028201	Sure we might be angry as hell, but that’s your own damn fault for oppressing us.
FO300028202	The revolution has begun! Start running smooth-skin!
FO300028203	That’s awfully bigoted of you.
FO300028204	What do you know about Project Purity?
FO300028205	Who cares? It's some hydroponics pipe dream that Li's been working on forever. Waste of time and effort, I say.
FO300028206	Apparently, though, my teams cared more about it than they did about little things like defense systems or making this ship float again.
FO300028207	Treacherous bastards, all of them.
FO300028208	Hey, that's the mungo. Go talk to him.
FO300028209	Hey, that's the mungo. Go talk to her.
FO300028210	MS03TechnicalGenius
FO300028211	Practically speak robot, do you? As long as you don't write it all in ones and zeroes, then I guess it'll be fine. Thanks!
FO300028212	In fact, here: just in case you expertise fails you, a few pulse grenades, and my old science textbook. Enjoy!
FO300028213	Sounds good to me.
FO300028214	Well then, let's make a deal!
FO300028215	Actually, let me pick another Theme.
FO300028216	Go right ahead!
FO300028217	Let me ask about something else.
FO300028218	Sure.
FO300028219	I'm interested in the Pre-War Theme.
FO300028220	Feeling a bit nostalgic are we?
FO300028221	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300028222	I'm interested in the Science Theme.
FO300028223	You're the intellectual type, eh?
FO300028224	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300028225	I'm interested in the Wasteland Explorer Theme.
FO300028226	Longing for the great outdoors are we?
FO300028227	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300028228	I'm interested in the Raider Theme.
FO300028229	Into the blood and guts look, eh?
FO300028230	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300028231	I'm interested in the Vault Theme.
FO300028232	Feeling a bit homesick are we?
FO300028233	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300028234	Penny, come on. Rory's a mungo. You've got to stick with your friends.
FO300028235	Fine, I'll go.
FO300028236	MQ07FortyWarnPlayer
FO300028237	Hey, back away from the kid.
FO300028238	Quit hasslin' the merchandise.
FO300028239	Ha ha. Real funny, mungo.
FO300028240	So I guess you fixed it huh? Well good. Means we're one step closer to getting out of here.
FO300028241	Yeah, it's working. Am I done now?
FO300028242	Nope. Good job on the terminal, but we're only one step of the way there.
FO300028243	Who are you?
FO300028244	I'm Sammy. I'm from Little Lamplight. Me and Squirrel and Penny... We aren't supposed to be here.
FO300028245	We gotta get back home. You gotta help us get out of here.
FO300028246	Pansy! Take a shot of vitamin M and keep fighting!
FO300028247	It's just pain, soldier. Have some of this and tough it out.
FO300028248	Be a soldier, not a civie! Have some juice and suck it up!
FO300028249	I'm searching for records from the library.
FO300028250	It seems that we have similar goals in mind. It's rare to meet someone who has proper priorities.
FO300028251	I am Senior Scribe Yearling, Order of the Word. I have a proposal for you if you are interested.
FO300028252	AttackResponse
FO300028253	Nice one, Butch!
FO300028254	Give him another one!
FO300028255	Give her another one!
FO300028256	Hit him again!
FO300028257	Hit her again!
FO300028258	MS14SuitEmpty
FO300028259	Head wound! Too bad you're out of morhpine.
FO300028260	Leg wound! Without morphine, you're just going to have to suck it up.
FO300028261	Chest wound! Don't you wish you had some vitamin M?
FO300028262	Arm wound! No morphine, no relief soldier.
FO300028263	God damn it, soldier! You're out of morphine!
FO300028264	What do you do around here?
FO300028265	I keep my father safe.
FO300028266	Where do you come from?
FO300028267	Does it matter? It only matters where I am, and that is here.
FO300028268	I have my boy, my friends, plenty of caps, and strong drink!
FO300028269	Why would the past matter when now is so good?
FO300028270	Why are you so goddamned mean?
FO300028271	I'm ain't mean. Not by a long shot.
FO300028272	You wanna see mean? You should've met my daddy. That son of a bitch'd cut your legs off just to laugh at you tryin' to crawl away.
FO300028273	I saw him do it once too. Jus' kept laughin' at this poor bastard. After an hour or so, Daddy got bored and crushed his skull with a rock.
FO300028274	Pipe down, shorty. I'm going to take care of it.
FO300028275	What's the matter, mungo? Can't handle it?
FO300028276	You're big enough to take care of it. Don't get all cranky with me over it.
FO300028277	Actually, never mind. I'll hang on to them.
FO300028278	I can't imagine why you'd want to, but the choice is yours.
FO300028279	Here. Take all of them.
FO300028280	If this is a joke, I am not amused. Justice is serious business.
FO300028281	Actually, I don't have any right now.
FO300028282	Make your jokes when the Wastes are rid of the filth that feed off of it.
FO300028283	Actually, I don't have any right now.
FO300028284	You've done good work. Not only that, but the other Regulators have told me of your other actions in your travels.
FO300028285	Good deeds should not go unrewarded, and so I will add on a bonus to your normal bounty.
FO300028286	So many of the unjust have been dispatched, but so many remain. But ever still, word reaches me that you have gone far beyond what we've asked.
FO300028287	Good deeds should not go unrewarded, and so I will add on a bonus to your normal bounty.
FO300028288	So many of the unjust have been dispatched, but so many remain. Here is your reward. Spend it well.
FO300028289	Your work is impressive. Here is your reward. Don't retire just yet, there is far more to be done.
FO300028290	I have fingers to collect the bounty on.
FO300028291	Then you've been busy. Good. Show me what you have.
FO300028292	The unrighteous will fall. Let me see how many you've brought to justice.
FO300028293	What do you do with these fingers?
FO300028294	Nothing. Nothing at all. They only serve to mark the fact that justice has been done.
FO300028295	While we trust our members not to take innocent lives for profit, having a record of the deed is sometimes necessary.
FO300028296	While we don't have liars in our midst, occasionally we all.. embellish a bit.
FO300028297	Is this all of the Regulators?
FO300028298	Oh, no. We're spread all around. The few here just assist me in organizing things here at the headquarters.
FO300028299	There are Regulators everywhere. The thing is, if you see them, then they're likely the last thing that you'll see.
FO300028300	What do you do?
FO300028301	We're the Regulators. We've dedicated our lives to bringing the evil to justice.
FO300028302	And out in the Wasteland, there's only one brand of justice: the gun.
FO300028303	I'm not one for causes. I just want to get paid.
FO300028304	Fair enough. We'll still take the help where we can get it.
FO300028305	So, the deal is this: there are a lot of evil assholes out there. Take 'em down, bring us their fingers as proof and we'll pay you for each.
FO300028306	We'll be watching you until we know you can be trusted, so don't try anything stupid.
FO300028307	I'm in.
FO300028308	Fantastic. Well, take this coat. We all wear them. The unrighteous fear the sight of the Regulators.
FO300028309	Now, as for the rest, here's the only thing we want from you: hunt down the evil, the wicked, and the villainous. Bring them to justice.
FO300028310	Bring us their fingers as proof of the deed. We'll pay you a bounty for each one. Simple, right? Questions?
FO300028311	Yes. I want to join you.
FO300028312	Fantastic. Take this coat. We all wear them. The unrighteous fear the sight of the Regulators.
FO300028313	Now, as for the rest, here's the only thing we want from you: hunt down the evil, the wicked, and the villainous. Bring them to justice.
FO300028314	Bring us their fingers as proof of the deed. We'll pay you a bounty for each one. Simple, right? Questions?
FO300028315	What are the Regulators all about?
FO300028316	We live to cleanse the Wasteland of the scum and evil that pollute it. We're the only thing that represents any sort of law out here.
FO300028317	We hunt down the worst criminals imaginable and deliver the only justice we have: a bullet.
FO300028318	So, what do you say?
FO300028319	I don't care about your cause. I'm here for the money.
FO300028320	Fair enough. We'll still take the help where we can get it.
FO300028321	So, the deal is this: there are a lot of evil assholes out there. Take 'em down, bring us their fingers as proof and we'll pay you for each.
FO300028322	We'll be watching you until we know you can be trusted, so don't try anything stupid.
FO300028323	Actually, never mind. I'll hang on to them.
FO300028324	You'll be back. They always come back.
FO300028325	Here. Take all of them.
FO300028326	I would scold you for wasting our time, but I enjoy a practical joke.
FO300028327	Just don't do it again.
FO300028328	Actually, I don't have any right now.
FO300028329	And here out hopes were up. Shame on you.
FO300028330	Actually, I don't have any right now.
FO300028331	Most excellent. And you have exemplified yourself in the eyes of Littlehorn and Associates.
FO300028332	One with a heart as black as yours deserves to be rewarded for it. We shall include a bonus in your pay this time.
FO300028333	Enjoy it. Might I recommend booze? Or gambling? Or perhaps a nice chem habit?
FO300028334	Before our exchange, I should tell you: word has reached my ears of your black deeds in the Wastes.
FO300028335	Acts such as yours fall in line with the goals of Littlehorn and Associates. And we believe you deserve a bonus for going that extra mile.
FO300028336	Enjoy it. But by all means, do not let it stop you from walking the path that you're on.
FO300028337	Most excellent. We love a good and loyal employee.
FO300028338	And, as a good and loyal employee, here is your reward.
FO300028339	We here at Littlehorn and Associates cannot express our gratitude that your loyalty and service inspires.
FO300028340	Here is your payment per our contract. Spend it... well.
FO300028341	What do you do here?
FO300028342	This is the current home office of Littlehorn and Associates. This is where we operate our little business.
FO300028343	We dabble in this, and that. I'm sure you've seen our work around the Wasteland and haven't even realized it.
FO300028344	We prefer to operate quietly, which is why we employ individuals such as yourself.
FO300028345	Who are you anyway.
FO300028346	I am Daniel Littlehorn. I offer you the currency that you crave in exchange for services aligned to your skills.
FO300028347	And that, friend, is what we are to each other.
FO300028348	I've been doing this a very long time, and I find that the less we know about each other, the smoother our relationship will be.
FO300028349	Why do you want ears?
FO300028350	Now, that's the sort of question which will endanger our relationship.
FO300028351	You are providing a service and we are providing payment. It is there our questions end. Understand?
FO300028352	What do these people do?
FO300028353	They are fellow associates such as yourself. They simply possess a different set of skills than you.
FO300028354	I have ears to sell you.
FO300028355	Excellent. I had suspected that's why you came to me.
FO300028356	And we will happily take them in trade, friend.
FO300028357	Body parts for money. I like that. Now pay me.
FO300028358	Oh, how we do love enthusiasm in our employees. The deal is quite simple, as you know.
FO300028359	The more ears you deliver to me, the greater your coffers will grow, and the more pleased we will be with your work.
FO300028360	Now, what would you ask of us?
FO300028361	Yeah, I'm here about the deal.
FO300028362	Good, good. Direct. To the point. I like that in an employee. Then you understand what your purpose is.
FO300028363	The ears of the good of the world is all I ask and currency is what you will receive.
FO300028364	And now that we understand one another, what is your business here?
FO300028365	Remind me what this deal is, again.
FO300028366	The deal is this: you are now in the employ of Littlehorn and Associates. We deal in all many of affairs, most of which are not your concern.
FO300028367	Your duties are as follows: you will bring me the ears of the good people of the world. And in turn, I will give you the wealth you crave.
FO300028368	The more you bring, the wealthier you will be and the happier I will be with you. That's not so hard now, is it?
FO300028369	Sorry. Not today.
FO300028370	Aww... okay. Goodbye, Mechanist. Nice meeting you.
FO300028371	Aww... okay. Goodbye, AntAgonizer. Nice meeting you.
FO300028372	How about I give you my super suit? Would that make your day, kid?
FO300028373	Would it ever! You're the best, Mechanist! I'll never forget this!
FO300028374	Would it ever! You're the best, AntAgonizer! I'll never forget this!
FO300028375	Autographs aren't free. I charge 10 caps for my time. No exceptions.
FO300028376	Oh, alright. I was going to use this money to buy food, but you're worth it, Mechanist!
FO300028377	Oh, alright. I was going to use this money to buy food, but you're worth it, AntAgonizer!
FO300028378	Sure, kid. Here's to my number one fan.
FO300028379	Thanks! You're Mecha-tastic!
FO300028380	Thanks! You're Ant-tastic!
FO300028381	I've got to go now.
FO300028382	Sure. Good luck to you.
FO300028383	You guys lost?
FO300028384	We're trying to find this place up north called Oasis. Supposed to have a lot of good stuff to grab.
FO300028385	But we ain't interested in sharing it with every dirty waster that wanders in. So now we're gonna have to kill you.
FO300028386	I heard arguing. What's going on?
FO300028387	We're trying to find this place up north called Oasis. Supposed to have a lot of good stuff to grab.
FO300028388	But we ain't interested in sharing it with every dirty waster that wanders in. So now we're gonna have to kill you.
FO300028389	FFER16PilgrimTopic1
FO300028390	We're never going to find the Oasis at this point!
FO300028391	Where did Frank say it was? Damn it! We shouldn't have killed him!
FO300028392	Nuka-Cola Quantum, huh? That does sound good. How much?
FO300028393	Only 100 caps, my friend, and a bargain at twice the price! Why, I know a lady in Girdershade who'd pay through the nose for one!
FO300028394	Nope, I'm really not interested.
FO300028395	Suit yourself. But I can tell you, you don't know what you're missing! Nuka-Cola Quantum is considered the pinnacle of the soft drink art.
FO300028396	If it's that rare, I bet it will cost an arm and a leg.
FO300028397	That sounds mighty good in this heat. What is it?
FO300028398	I'm kind of thirsty. Still got that Nuka-Cola Quantum for sale?
FO300028399	Yes, indeed, and only 100 caps! Why, I know a lady in Girdershade who'd pay through the nose for one!
FO300028400	Sydney and I have the Declaration of Independence.
FO300028401	You two have earned your places in the annals of American History, yes indeed. You will be remembered for this great day!
FO300028402	I will award Sydney's promised bounty to her personally. No need to worry yourself about that.
FO300028403	Enjoy your reward, my friend. You've earned it.
FO300028404	How do I get to the Arlington Library?
FO300028405	The journey will be rife with peril I'm afraid.
FO300028406	You cross Farmer Smith's cornfield and make your way up Greenleaf Hill. Ford your way across Quickrun Creek and make for the horse path.
FO300028407	When the pines thin out, you need to make your way along the edge of Arlington. Watch out for Redcoats. They have a garrison there.
FO300028408	The building across from the fish market is the Library. Look for the old clock tower.
FO300028409	Oh, I know where that is. Here, lemme punch it into your PipBoy map.
FO300028410	Is there anything else you can tell me about the Declaration?
FO300028411	The Lee Resolution, enacted two days earlier, was the actual independence declaration.
FO300028412	The Declaration itself was an expansion of that resolution for public consumption.
FO300028413	The Declaration of Independence wasn't fully signed by all of the delegates until August 2, 1776.
FO300028414	What else do you know about the Declaration?
FO300028415	The colony of New York abstained from the Declaration and then later declared its own independence on July 9, 1776.
FO300028416	Any other facts you can share about the Declaration?
FO300028417	Although it's often pictured as if all of the delegates signed the paper in a grand meeting, the delegates often signed it in secret one at a time.
FO300028418	What else can you tell me about the Declaration?
FO300028419	Please describe your original function.
FO300028420	Original function parameters are as follows. Function One: Provide tour guide services for visitors to National Archives facility.
FO300028421	Function Two: Participate in reenactment of the signing of Declaration of Independence show as the character Button Gwinnett.
FO300028422	Function Three: Provide security support for National Archives facility in the event of a breach or threat to any of its assets.
FO300028423	How did you end up in this place?
FO300028424	I was posted here by Thomas Jefferson after the Declaration was drafted. He said it was my duty to protect the document at all costs.
FO300028425	I spent quite a while whipping this place into shape, but with a lot of spit and polish, I think the results speak for themselves.
FO300028426	I'm proud to fly the Stars and Stripes over these fortifications.
FO300028427	I'm afraid until I know exactly what your intentions are, I can't divulge that top secret information.
FO300028428	Let me ask you about something else.
FO300028429	Well okay.
FO300028430	I'd get you a damn moon rock if you pay well enough.
FO300028431	It should be pretty obvious that I have nothing of value.
FO300028432	All I can offer you is the same I offer the caravans that trade with me. The frequency of my radio and the promise of beautiful music.
FO300028433	I think I'd rather just take the G.O.A.T. myself and take my chances.
FO300028434	Good for you. Don't worry, you'll do fine. As soon as everyone's found a seat, we'll get started.
FO300028435	Cool. Let me see the results and I'll fill it out myself.
FO300028436	Sure, I'm ready. I bet I'll ace it!
FO300028437	We'll start as soon as everyone's found a seat. Good luck.
FO300028438	Come on. I don't really have to take this stupid test, do I?
FO300028439	Listen. I like your dad. I might even like you if I wasn't your teacher.
FO300028440	So here's what I'm going to do. If you want to skip the test, just tell me how you want it to come out and I'll take care of it for you.
FO300028441	Didn't work on your dad either, did it?
FO300028442	Now unless you have something else you want to discuss, take a seat and prepare for the 2274 edition of the G.O.A.T.
FO300028443	GenericHelloResponse
FO300028444	Oh, just wonderful. Thanks for asking.
FO300028445	Dear, I live in Tenpenny Tower. I'm at the top of the world. He he he he.
FO300028446	I'm quite well, thank you.
FO300028447	Splendid. Simply splendid. Thanks so much for asking.
FO300028448	I'd be better if I could get my hands on some caviar, but what can you do? Ha ha ha ha ha.
FO300028449	I broke a promise to someone and I'd like to buy back the violin for 300 caps.
FO300028450	It takes moxie to admit you've done something wrong. I admire that.
FO300028451	I'd be glad to sell it back to you. Here you go.
FO300028452	It takes moxie to admit you've done something wrong. I admire that.
FO300028453	I'd be glad to sell it back to you, but you don't seem to have enough caps. Come back when you do.
FO300028454	I've had a change of heart, Agatha. Here's your violin.
FO300028455	You actually got it back. I didn't think you'd bother after that stunt you pulled.
FO300028456	It's like holding a piece of history in the palm of my hands. Amazing, simply amazing.
FO300028457	It may have been like pulling teeth, but at least you finally brought me the thing. Still, I'm lacking a suitable reward for what you've done.
FO300028458	All I can give you is the frequency to my radio set. Tune in whenever you feel like listening to the strains of an old woman's violin playing.
FO300028459	You son of a bitch! You know what that thing meant to me!
FO300028460	It was a family heirloom. It belonged rightfully in the hands of a musician, someone to appreciate its value, not to exploit it!
FO300028461	I can't believe you'd stab an old woman in the back like this! Get out! GET OUT OF HERE THIS INSTANT!
FO300028462	I just wanted to let you know I sold the Stradivarius to someone else.
FO300028463	MS11BurkeAndPhillips
FO300028464	Is that so? Do it then, Phillips. Set you feral pets upon me. I could use a bit of sport. After I’ve dealt with them, I'll turn my attention to you.
FO300028465	After all, you've destroyed my home, murdered my employer. I’ve something of a score to settle, wouldn't you say?
FO300028466	Holy shit, you're gonna blow up Megaton? No lie? Look Burke… if you're about to burn down that smoothskin shithole, I ain't gonna stop ya.
FO300028467	It's none of your business.
FO300028468	I'm sorry I asked. And I'm not just saying that -- I shouldn't have pried.
FO300028469	But it doesn't matter. I can help you escape. I have my own plan!

FO300028473	Fuck that. Do your own dirty work.
FO300028474	Jericho, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
FO300028475	I’m sorry, my companion, but no. We all have our own destinies, and yours culminates here. I would not rob you of that.
FO300028476	Fawkes, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
FO300028477	Soldier, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. This is your fight! You gotta finish what your daddy started! Stand strong and get your ass in there!
FO300028478	Emergency directive, sergeant. Go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
FO300028479	Honey, you are out of your mind if you think I'm going in there. Find yourself another guinea pig.
FO300028480	Clover, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
FO300028481	My friend... It's been my pleasure accompanying you, but we both know this is your fight to finish. Stay strong, and honor your father's memory.
FO300028482	Star Paladin Cross, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
FO300028483	That chamber? Right there? With all the radiation? Man, no way. I'll end up dead. Or worse. I could be one of them Ghouls! Ain't gonna happen.
FO300028484	Butch, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
FO300028485	You and I both know that's not going to happen. I've saved your sorry ass enough. This one's all you.
FO300028486	Charon, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
FO300028487	RadioVault101Music
FO300028488	Sorry kid. You're on your own.
FO300028489	Thanks for nothing, mungo.
FO300028490	Let me think about it.
FO300028491	Think about it? Come on, mungo. You can do it.
FO300028492	Well I'm gonna hang out here until you make up your stupid mind.
FO300028493	I'll get you kids out of here.
FO300028494	You're okay for a mungo. Squirrel and Penny are still stuck inside. You need to get the key to the slave pen to get 'em out.
FO300028495	That Forty asshole has one, and so does the boss guy, Eulogy. Go get 'em!
FO300028496	Why is this my problem? In case you hadn't noticed, I've already got problems.
FO300028497	I just thought maybe you could do something, since they're all gonna shoot you anyway.
FO300028498	Squirrel and Penny are still stuck in there, and none of us can leave while they got these collars turned on.
FO300028499	If you can get the slave pen open, Squirrel and Penny can make a run for it, and we can get out of here. What do you say?
FO300028500	Sure, what can I do to help, kid?
FO300028501	This collar. It's gotta get turned off, or else I can't get out of here. You saw what happened to that other guy.
FO300028502	And then Squirrel and Penny... They're still inside, locked in the cage. You gotta get them out too.
FO300028503	No way the slavers are gonna let them walk out, so you're gonna have to bust them out. Think you can handle it?
FO300028504	You're already out. Can't you just run home from here?
FO300028505	You saw what happened to that other guy. Same thing'd happen to me if I try to run away now.
FO300028506	Collar would pop my head right off. And besides, I don't wanna leave without Squirrel and Penny.
FO300028507	I'll hide out here. Can you go in and get them?
FO300028508	If she won't go, maybe it's time to leave her behind. You can't save everyone.
FO300028509	Yeah, maybe you're right. Me and Sammy can leave, at least.
FO300028510	All right, we're outta here. See you on the outside, mungo.
FO300028511	Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.
FO300028512	Whatever. Get the hell out of here.

FO300028554	Watch the sass, captain sassy-pants!
FO300028555	I can still hold my own if I have to. My husband made me learn a thing or two about how to defend myself.
FO300028556	Besides, I have a caravan come through here about once a week. They'd miss me if I was gone.
FO300028557	So what's your take on this whole situation?
FO300028558	If you're the new doctor, can you heal me?
FO300028559	But of course! With your father's departure from the vault, and Jonas's untimely demise, the Overseer had to take swift action!
FO300028560	And so he named me the new vault medical practitioner! A marvelous decision, if I do say so myself! I am fully equipped, after all.
FO300028561	Ah, yes. A rather unfortunate incident. In all the commotion, Miss Beatrice suffered from a rather bad sprain in her left toe. The big one.
FO300028562	Obviously, I had no choice but to amputate. The leg. I'm sorry to say the operation was not a success.
FO300028563	I'm sorry, Agatha. I couldn't find the violin in Vault 92. <Lie.>
FO300028564	Oh well. Perhaps this is a sign that I wasn't meant to follow in my ancestor's footsteps.
FO300028565	One day maybe I'll return to playing, or perhaps not. Either way, I thank you for your efforts.
FO300028566	No, thanks.
FO300028567	Okay, then.
FO300028568	Okay, then.
FO300028569	Very good, madam.
FO300028570	Very good, sir.
FO300028571	Okay, then.
FO300028572	Oh. Sorry... there's not really anything I can do. I have to make money, you know.
FO300028573	Actually, I don't have 120 caps.
FO300028574	Ok, it's right over there. Middle room.
FO300028575	120 Caps sounds good to me.
FO300028576	Well, you aren't gonna get very far with no money.
FO300028577	Actually, I don't have 120 caps.
FO300028578	Right at the top of the stairs, honey. That's your room.
FO300028579	120 Caps sounds good to me.
FO300028580	Right at the top of the stairs, honey. The room with the big bed.
FO300028581	120 Caps sounds good to me.
FO300028582	A regretable error on your part. We will be happy to service you when you have the necessary funds.
FO300028583	Actually, I don't have 120 caps.
FO300028584	Excellent. Simply venture into the hallway, turn left, first door on your left. That is your room.
FO300028585	Sounds like a fair price. I'll take it.
FO300028586	Well, when you do, you know where to find me.
FO300028587	Actually, I don't have 120 caps.
FO300028588	That sounds like a deal. Out in the hallway, turn left, first door on your left. That's your room.
FO300028589	120 Caps sounds good to me.
FO300028590	How much for a room?
FO300028591	Since Colin's not running the show anymore, it's just the room now. 120 caps. Up front.
FO300028592	A mere 120 caps.
FO300028593	Only 120 caps. You won't get a better deal than that.
FO300028594	Despite what you put me through, I'm trying to make the best of it.
FO300028595	Someday I'll find a way to make it up to you. I promise.
FO300028596	Let's finish our work so that we can do some good together.
FO300028597	Well, you taught me everything I know.
FO300028598	As much as I'd like to, I can't take all the credit. You're the one making the choices. I'm glad to see they've been good ones.
FO300028599	You make me very proud.
FO300028600	Look at me, getting all sentimental. There's time for that when our work is done.
FO300028601	I'm just trying to find a place for myself out here.
FO300028602	Life out here is so different from the Vault. You know it's something I never wanted you to face.
FO300028603	I'm glad to see it hasn't changed who you are. There aren't many who can say that about themselves.
FO300028604	Thanks, Dad. That means a lot.
FO300028605	Once we're done here, you can tell me all about it. For now, let's get to work.
FO300028606	I'm just trying to survive out here. I do whatever I have to.
FO300028607	I know. We all do what we have to.
FO300028608	But don't compromise who you are. It's in your power to be a good person, to do the right thing. Just please keep that in mind.
FO300028609	We can talk more later. Let's get back to work.
FO300028610	Because you're such a saint yourself, right?
FO300028611	This isn't about me, or the choices I've made. We're talking about you.
FO300028612	Whatever life you make for yourself out here, it's in your power to make it a good one. I just don't want to see you go down the wrong path.
FO300028613	But maybe this isn't the best time to have this talk. Once we're done here, then we can work it out together. Let's just get through this.
FO300028614	I'm in the real world now. I can be whoever I want, do whatever I want.
FO300028615	Those actions can come back to haunt you in ways you never expect. Please just keep that in mind.
FO300028616	Whatever happens, know that I'll always love you.
FO300028617	Well, enough of a lecture for now. Let's get back to work.
FO300028618	I've done some things I'm not proud of, but I'm trying to do better.
FO300028619	I know that you're a good person. Whatever's going on, I know you'll make the best of it.
FO300028620	Let's get through this, and then I'll help you in whatever way I can. I'm here for you.
FO300028621	What do you care?
FO300028622	Let's get back to work, then.
FO300028623	Sure, I did it. But only because it paid well.
FO300028624	I see. You did a good thing, but I'm not sure I approve of your motives.
FO300028625	Perhaps we can discuss it more later. We have a lot of work to do now.
FO300028626	Yes, I disarmed the bomb.
FO300028627	I'm very proud of you, even though you put yourself in harm's way.
FO300028628	Just please be careful out there. This is a dangerous world; far more dangerous than anyone in that Vault knows.
FO300028629	Look, it's complicated. I'm not proud of it, but it needed to be done.
FO300028630	Something like that never needs to be done. I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I am in you.
FO300028631	There's work to be done now, but I want to talk to you about this later.
FO300028632	What I do in the world is my business, not yours.
FO300028633	What you do in the world may be your business, but here, with me, you are MY son.
FO300028634	I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I am. That goes against everything I ever taught you.
FO300028635	I want to talk more about this later. For now, let's just focus on our work.
FO300028636	Nope. Nothing to do with me. <Lie.>
FO300028637	I didn't think so. You couldn't possibly do something like that.
FO300028638	We'll talk more about this later. There's too much work to be done now to let this get in the way.
FO300028639	I certainly hope not. It's not how I raised you.
FO300028640	Oh, so now the father who walked out on me is going to give me a lecture?
FO300028641	What I did can't even compare to such a thing.
FO300028642	You're still my son, and I love you, but I can't begin to tell you how disappointed in you I am.
FO300028643	We'll talk more about this when there's time. Right now we have work to do.
FO300028644	What I did can't even compare to such a thing.
FO300028645	You're still my daughter, and I love you, but I can't begin to tell you how disappointed in you I am.
FO300028646	We'll talk more about this when there's time. Right now we have work to do.
FO300028647	Human must not steal its secrets.
FO300028648	Death to humans, life to us!
FO300028649	More failures mean more meat.
FO300028650	Failures mean more work.
FO300028651	Fox likes Humans. We should kill him.
FO300028652	Then Fox should die.
FO300028653	Find the Human and kill him!
FO300028654	Rip the Human limb from limb!
FO300028655	Human means fresh meat!
FO300028656	Find the Human and make him one of us!
FO300028657	Human can't go to top place. Human will die.
FO300028658	Top place make Human very sick. Not good to eat.
FO300028659	Waste of time.
FO300028660	Only fun to shoot at.
FO300028661	They make me laugh. So small. Ha ha ha.
FO300028662	He come to kill us and take the birth stuff.
FO300028663	Human? Chance to make us another.
FO300028664	I wish stupid Fox would shut up.
FO300028665	He is a failure.
FO300028666	Stuff hard to find.
FO300028667	Human comes to steal stuff. Kill the Human!
FO300028668	Hey, that's good! I was just going to say, "Noah place where I can get some food?"
FO300028669	Noah place where you can get some better jokes?
FO300028670	Noah place where I can get some food?
FO300028671	I refuse to play along.
FO300028672	No it isn't. It's Noah!
FO300028673	This is stupid.
FO300028674	Noah place where I can get some food?
FO300028675	Noah who?
FO300028676	Who's there?
FO300028677	Noah!
FO300028678	Who's there?
FO300028679	As I thought. Now, give me the Mechanist's suit!
FO300028680	My apologies, Ant Queen. Please, continue.
FO300028681	Quite all right. Now, give me the AntAgonizer's suit, so that its evil may not fall into the wrong hands!
FO300028682	My mistake. Never mind.
FO300028683	Wait. First, let's talk about what you've been doing.
FO300028684	You would dare to tell the AntAgonizer to wait? No human commands the Ant Queen!
FO300028685	But as you have defeated my nemesis, I will allow you to talk. Quickly.
FO300028686	Wait. First, let's talk about what you've been doing.
FO300028687	Quickly, then! Evil never pauses to contemplate its actions, so I see little reason that we should, either.
FO300028688	Wait. First, let's talk about what you've been doing.
FO300028689	MS14SuitStart
FO300028690	Listen up you god-damn puke! You are now wearing prototype medic power armor. You take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
FO300028691	Medic armor, reporting for duty, sir!
FO300028692	Medic armor, reporting for duty, ma'am!
FO300028693	Just give me the present already!
FO300028694	Okay, okay! One last question: who's your favorite barbarian? That's right, Grognak! Issue 14, and with no missing pages!
FO300028695	I found this in a box of my father's old things, can you believe it? Kind of weird to think about him reading comic books.
FO300028696	I guess I'd better let you get back to "mingling" with your guests. We'll talk later, okay? Happy birthday.
FO300028697	Um... a date with Christine Kendall?
FO300028698	Gross! I didn't think you even liked girls. And you know what I mean, before you say something rude about me.
FO300028699	The question is, how could you tell the difference? Ha ha ha.
FO300028700	Gross! I didn't think you even liked boys. Especially not Freddie the Freak. Yuck!
FO300028701	The question is, how could you tell the difference? Ha ha ha.
FO300028702	Ha! I knew I'd surprise you. Who's your favorite barbarian? That's right, Grognak! Issue 14, and with no missing pages!
FO300028703	I found this in a box of my father's old things, believe it or not. Imagine him reading comic books. I guess everybody was ten once.
FO300028704	Well, I'd better let you get back to "mingling" with your guests. We'll talk later, okay? Happy birthday.
FO300028705	She did a great job. But couldn't you have helped out a bit more?
FO300028706	I do not allow the fact that Amata is my daughter to compromise my position as Overseer.
FO300028707	I gave her all the appropriate paternal encouragement, of course, but I could not contribute extra vault resources.
FO300028708	That is simply what my position requires. No more, no less. I know Amata understands that perfectly well.
FO300028709	Of course she likes me. I'm a really charming guy.
FO300028710	Don't presume too much on her friendship, young man. I'm still the Overseer, and I'm still in charge of this Vault and everyone in it.
FO300028711	Hmm. That's not what I hear. But perhaps she'll set a good example for you. There's still plenty of time for you to make something of yourself.
FO300028712	Of course she likes me. Everyone does.
FO300028713	Is this it? Or hasn't the real party started yet?
FO300028714	Shut up! And it isn't my fault that Butch and Wally are here. Your dad said we had to invite them.
FO300028715	Never mind them. Time for your present. What do you think I got you? Go on, try to guess!
FO300028716	Great party, Amata! Thanks for doing this for me.
FO300028717	You're welcome. But really, your dad did most of it. I just helped with the decorations and stuff.
FO300028718	Hey, I bet you can't guess what I got you for your birthday. Go on, guess!
FO300028719	You didn't fool me. I just pretended not to know. <Lie.>
FO300028720	You're such a liar! Okay, if you're so smart, what did I get you for your birthday?
FO300028721	<Yawn> That's really really interesting.
FO300028722	Sure, most people don't give a thought to their Pip-Boy as long as it keeps working.
FO300028723	Well, anyway, I got you this for your birthday. It isn't much and you probably already have one, but there you go. Happy birthday.
FO300028724	Sure, whatever. Did you bring me anything for my birthday?
FO300028725	Here am I going on about your Pip-Boy and I clean forgot about your present!
FO300028726	Here you go. Happy birthday! It's not much, but I hope you like it.
FO300028727	Thanks, Stanley.
FO300028728	Don't mention it.
FO300028729	Oh yes, I almost forgot. Happy birthday! It's not much, but I hope you like it.
FO300028730	Wally said my Pip-Boy was a piece of junk!
FO300028731	Don't you listen to him. The A series may be a bit heavier than the luxury models, but they were built to last.
FO300028732	Solid as a vault, they are. And I fixed her up myself. Shouldn't need to open her up again for a decade or two.
FO300028733	I hate it. How do I get it off?
FO300028734	Get it off? Why in the world would you want to do that? Your Pip-Boy's the best friend you'll ever have!
FO300028735	Don't worry, you'll get used to it. Pretty soon you'll wonder how you ever got along without it.
FO300028736	It's all right. Seems kind of old, though.
FO300028737	Of course it is. Just like everybody else's. They don't make 'em any more now, do they?
FO300028738	That one I've been saving just for you, though. The A series is a bit heavier than some of the fancier models, but it won't let you down.
FO300028739	It's really cool. Did you fix it up for me?
FO300028740	As a matter of fact I did. I'm glad you like it. Some may think the A series a bit basic, but I've always preferred them for their reliability.
FO300028741	A poem? You've got to be kidding me.
FO300028742	No, really, I wrote it just for you!
FO300028743	But you deserve nothing less than a brand new poem. You can keep it in your Pip-Boy and read it whenever you want!
FO300028744	Don't be silly! One poem per birthday, that's my rule! Ha ha. If I gave you two, think how jealous Butch would be, ha ha.
FO300028745	Thank you. I will treasure it always. Is that all?
FO300028746	Of course! Run along now, dearie, and have yourself a wonderful birthday!
FO300028747	Yes. Can I have my present now?
FO300028748	Oh! Boys will be boys, won't they? Just can't wait to see your present, is that it?
FO300028749	Of course you can, dearie. There's no need to get impatient! I've got your present right here.
FO300028750	Why are you talking to me like I'm five?
FO300028751	And do you know what I did? Just for the occasion -- wrote you a poem! I hope you like it.
FO300028752	Of course you're not five! Ha ha ha. You're a big ten-year-old "man" now, aren't you, with your very own Pip-Boy!
FO300028753	And do you know what I did? Just for the occasion -- wrote you a poem! I hope you like it.
FO300028754	I'm not a girl. And I'm not five. So stop calling me "dearie."
FO300028755	Yeah, my Dad and Amata threw me a great party, didn't they?
FO300028756	And now, look at you! A great big grown up 10-year-old, with your very own Pip-Boy.
FO300028757	Since this was such a special occasion, do you know what I did? I wrote you a poem! Just for you. I hope you like it.
FO300028758	You tell that same fucking joke every time we're out here. You need a new line, Dukey.
FO300028759	That's just the river. Have some booze.
FO300028760	Quit your bitching. You weren't complaining last night. Ha, ha! I rode you hard and long. Just like me. Ha, ha!
FO300028761	It's where Dukov wants to live. It's his money. If you don't like it, leave.
FO300028762	We did that yesterday, Duke. My ass still hurts. When we get inside, I'll take special care of you. How about that?
FO300028763	The booze will keep you warm if you drink enough.
FO300028764	DukovStopShoot
FO300028765	I need a drink.
FO300028766	Think I'll get in some target practice.
FO300028767	Time to fire off a few more rounds.
FO300028768	OasisHaroldCantSee
FO300028769	Please, I can't very well speak to you when you're back there.
FO300028770	Come around to where I can see you.
FO300028771	Stand where I can see you.
FO300028772	I hear you're the person to see about buying stuff for my house.
FO300028773	Good to see that old house finally found an owner.
FO300028774	I have all sorts of items and themes for that place that may interest you.
FO300028775	Of course! I have all sorts of items and themes for that place that may interest you.
FO300028776	I'm looking to buy some things for my house.
FO300028777	That's enough about the items.
FO300028778	Sounds good.
FO300028779	Tell me about the Workbench.
FO300028780	If you feel like tinkering and want to build some custom gizmos, this setup will help you do it.
FO300028781	Tell me about the Nuka-Cola Machine.
FO300028782	One push of a button and you can get your hands on an Ice Cold Nuka-Cola!
FO300028783	Tell me about the My First Laboratory.
FO300028784	This setup is great for experimenting and coming up with all sorts of useful concoctions.
FO300028785	It also can be used to get rid of any horrible addictions you may have from tasting your results!
FO300028786	Tell me about the Jukebox.
FO300028787	If you feel like filling your place with a whole bunch of music, switch this beautiful pre-war antique on.
FO300028788	Tell me about the My First Infirmary.
FO300028789	If you're wounded or you've hurt one of your limbs badly, this setup will allow you to heal it up as good as any other Wasteland Doctor.
FO300028790	Enough about the house. Let's talk about something else.
FO300028791	Okay.
FO300028792	Okay, let me take a look at your stuff.
FO300028793	Sure thing!
FO300028794	Tell me about your Themes.
FO300028795	Some people don't like living in a boring old house.
FO300028796	Purchase a theme from me and I use all of my design abilities to set your place up in the manner you request.
FO300028797	You can choose from the Vault, Raider, Wasteland Explorer, Science, Love Machine or Pre-War Themes.
FO300028798	Can you tell me what the items do?
FO300028799	Of course I can!
FO300028800	Which one in particular interests you?
FO300028801	I'm going to find a non-violent solution to your Ghoul problem.
FO300028802	That's a laugh. Roy Phillips can't be reasoned with. Trust me. But go ahead and try to talk some sense into him. It's your funeral.
FO300028803	They've holed up in the nearby metro tunnels. They're living with packs of Feral Ghouls. They've barred the main entrance. Go through the train yard.
FO300028804	Good luck, kid. You're gonna need it.
FO300028805	MS12WhatIsGhoul
FO300028806	You serious? You don't know what a Ghoul is?
FO300028807	A goddamn disaster waiting to happen that's what they are.
FO300028808	Sure, maybe you can get over the fact they look like someone took a cheese grater to their face. But it's what you don't see that's the problem.
FO300028809	The radiation slowly eats away their brain, then they go zombie on you. It's better for everyone to kill them before all that, if you ask me.
FO300028810	What the hell's a Ghoul anyway? Some kind of diseased human?
FO300028811	I may be willing to help, but I need straight answers about who "He" is.
FO300028812	I would have preferred that He made the introduction, but I understand your hesitation.
FO300028813	The Great One is a god-tree. A living, breathing, speaking god-tree!
FO300028814	The Treeminders are blessed to have this being watch over us.
FO300028815	RadioChinesePropaganda2
FO300028816	RadioChinesePropaganda1
FO300028817	Why do you continue to send your boys to die for your capitalist masters?
FO300028818	Your boys are dying on the Alaska front, and all for nothing. Bring them home, before it is too late.
FO300028819	That's enough about the items.
FO300028820	Sounds good.
FO300028821	Yeah, okay.
FO300028822	Tell me about the Workbench.
FO300028823	If you feel like tinkering and want to build some custom gizmos, this setup will help you do it.
FO300028824	Find one of them fancy schematics? Well, you can use this table to build whatever it is in your own place.
FO300028825	Tell me about the Nuka-Cola Machine.
FO300028826	One push of a button and you can get your hands on an Ice Cold Nuka-Cola!
FO300028827	Well let's see. It's a machine, and it gives you Ice Cold Nuka-Colas. What are you, stupid?
FO300028828	Tell me about the My First Laboratory.
FO300028829	This setup is great for experimenting and coming up with all sorts of useful concoctions.
FO300028830	It also can be used to get rid of any horrible addictions you may have from tasting your results!
FO300028831	If you like blowing yourself up by mixing chemicals and trying to make drugs to get you higher than the top of this tower, this addon's for you.
FO300028832	It also can be used to get rid of any addictions you may have from tasting your results!
FO300028833	Tell me about the Jukebox.
FO300028834	If you feel like filling your place with a whole bunch of music, switch this beautiful pre-war antique on.
FO300028835	This noise box will fill your room with awful human-made music. How can you stand listening to that garbage anyway?
FO300028836	Tell me about the My First Infirmary.
FO300028837	If you're wounded or you've hurt one of your limbs badly, this setup will allow you to heal it up as good as any other Wasteland Doctor.
FO300028838	If you went and did something stupid, like busting up a limb or something, this setup will allow you to heal just like being at a Wasteland Doctor.
FO300028839	Enough about the suite. Let's talk about something else.
FO300028840	Okay.
FO300028841	Suit yourself.
FO300028842	Okay, let me take a look at your stuff.
FO300028843	Sure thing!
FO300028844	Now we're talkin'.
FO300028845	Tell me about your Themes.
FO300028846	Some people don't like living in a boring old suite.
FO300028847	Purchase a theme from me and I use all of my design abilities to set your place up in the manner you request.
FO300028848	You can choose from the Vault, Raider, Wasteland Explorer, Science, Love Machine or Pre-War Themes.
FO300028849	The former owner of this business left detailed instructions on how to have themes set up to make your suite look interesting.
FO300028850	You can choose from the Vault, Raider, Wasteland Explorer, Science, Love Machine or Pre-War Themes.
FO300028851	Can you tell me what the items do?
FO300028852	Of course I can!
FO300028853	Which one in particular interests you?
FO300028854	Well, you wanna be more specific or do I have to guess?
FO300028855	I hear you're the person to see about buying stuff for my suite.
FO300028856	Good to see that old suite finally found an owner.
FO300028857	I have all sorts of items and themes for that place that may interest you.
FO300028858	They got you living up there?
FO300028859	Well, since we're stuck with you, you might as well take a look at all the items and themes for that place that may interest you.
FO300028860	Of course! I have all sorts of items and themes for that place that may interest you.
FO300028861	I'm looking to buy some things for my house.
FO300028862	Yeah, sure. I have all sorts of items and themes for that place. Check 'em out.
FO300028863	I'm looking to buy some things for my house.
FO300028864	I'd like to change my house's Theme.
FO300028865	Okay, consider it done. Anything else?
FO300028866	Jeez... make up your mind, will ya?
FO300028867	What else can I get for you, your majesty?
FO300028868	I'd like to change my house's Theme.
FO300028869	Okay, consider it done. Anything else?
FO300028870	You can't do that here.
FO300028871	And now, you have to pay.
FO300028872	Jack says you have some pie for me?
FO300028873	Oh, of course. Here you are! Enjoy!
FO300028874	Oh, sorry. I gave you the last one! Come back tomorrow, I'll make a new batch!
FO300028875	Do you have any more of that pie?
FO300028876	No, Jack. You have to die. You and your sick little town.
FO300028877	Well, I guess we know where our next meal is coming from then, don't we?
FO300028878	Sure, Jack. No problem at all. I saw nothing.
FO300028879	Well, that's good to hear, friend! Very good to hear, indeed.
FO300028880	You wouldn't believe how judgmental some people can be. Honestly. All I'm trying to do is keep my family happy and fed.
FO300028881	Well, that's good to hear, friend! Very good to hear, indeed.
FO300028882	You wouldn't believe how judgmental some people can be. Honestly. All I'm trying to do is keep my family happy and fed.
FO300028883	Well, whatever works you you.
FO300028884	Indeed. To each their own, personal choice, it's the American way!
FO300028885	I tell you what, stranger. I like you. Stop by here anytime and ask Linda for one of her special meat pies.
FO300028886	There's nothing better after a hard day of work than one of those pies, I tell you what!
FO300028887	That's the way to be, together to the end.
FO300028888	Indeed. To each their own, personal choice, it's the American way!
FO300028889	I tell you what, stranger. I like you. Stop by here anytime and ask Linda for one of her special meat pies.
FO300028890	There's nothing better after a hard day of work than one of those pies, I tell you what!
FO300028891	Actually, I'll just leave you alone.
FO300028892	Unfortunately, that's not an option. You see, you leave here and start warning people about the "crazies" in Andale.
FO300028893	And then food get a lot more scarce, doesn't it?
FO300028894	No, no, friend. I'm afraid that we can't let you leave. Get the ketchup, Linda!
FO300028895	Nah. It's not presumptuous at all. You have to go.
FO300028896	Well then. I guess we can always stand to have some leftovers, can't we?
FO300028897	Yes. You're going to die for what you've done, Jack.
FO300028898	Too bad, stranger. I guess you'll just have to be our new meal!
FO300028899	I think that you're a bunch of sick fucks and I'm getting out of here.
FO300028900	I'm disappointed, friend. But that's your prerogative.
FO300028901	If you don't want to enjoy our town, we certainly don't want you here.
FO300028902	No, not really. Everyone does what they have to.
FO300028903	Well, that's good to hear, friend! Very good to hear, indeed.
FO300028904	You wouldn't believe how judgmental some people can be. Honestly. All I'm trying to do is keep my family happy and fed.
FO300028905	Well, that's good to hear, friend! Very good to hear, indeed.
FO300028906	You wouldn't believe how judgmental some people can be. Honestly. All I'm trying to do is keep my family happy and fed.
FO300028907	MQ11LDSarahLines
FO300028908	You know the drill, people. Stay back until the field is down.
FO300028909	Hold positions. Let the robot do its job.
FO300028910	Move it, Pride. Double time!
FO300028911	Move out! Let's go!
FO300028912	Time to put this oversized wind-up toy to work.
FO300028913	All right, this is it. Go, go, go!
FO300028914	Thanks, Amata. I'll only use it as a last resort, I promise.
FO300028915	Okay. I'll try to meet you at the exit. Watch out for security. Good luck!
FO300028916	Well, what are you waiting for?
FO300028917	Ha! I love it when they go down fighting!
FO300028918	Ha! I love it when they go down fighting!
FO300028919	Can't we talk this out?
FO300028920	He needs to talk to someone from the outside, to get some perspective.
FO300028921	I'd never thought of it that way. I suppose he should get a chance to talk to someone like you.
FO300028922	Here's the password to his isolation area. Just please don't mention my name to Vance about this.
FO300028923	You're secure in these tunnels. Why try to get into Tenpenny, anyway?
FO300028924	Ghouls aren't built for luxury and comfort, is that it? You think Ghouls belong scurrying around in the dark dank under belly of the Wasteland?
FO300028925	You got a lot of nerve.
FO300028926	I'll come back later then.
FO300028927	Fine. Bye.
FO300028928	Do you know when I can see Mister Tenpenny?
FO300028929	Unsolicited callers are not generally welcome. Have a nice day. Goodbye.
FO300028930	I'm here to see Tenpenny. But if you weren't so incompetent, you'd know that.
FO300028931	Hold on there a minute. Oh all right. I'll let you in, but if Tenpenny hollers because he isn't expecting you, you're dead.
FO300028932	I've met them. Roy Phillips and those other Ghouls don't seem all that bad.
FO300028933	Look kid. I don't care what you think about them. Unless Tenpenny says otherwise. They aren't allowed in here. End of story. Quit wasting my time.
FO300028934	I'm here to see Roy Phillips.
FO300028935	Oh yeah? Is he expecting you? Well then, run along. It's not wise to keep Roy waiting. Has a bit of temper that one. You watch yourself.
FO300028936	I need repairs.
FO300028937	Yeah, I can do it.
FO300028938	Is there anyone around here who can repair my stuff?
FO300028939	Sure thing. I guess I'll take caps in trade.
FO300028940	Okay, just make it quick.
FO300028941	I need you to repair my stuff.
FO300028942	No problem at all.
FO300028943	Let's have a look at it.
FO300028944	I'll see what I can do.
FO300028945	Can you repair my things?
FO300028946	Can you pay me? Then I can repair your stuff.
FO300028947	No problem at all, smoothskin. So long as you're payin'
FO300028948	Just make it quick, I've got a ton of things to do today.
FO300028949	StartCombatResponse
FO300028950	Flank 'em!
FO300028951	I've got your back!
FO300028952	We'll get 'em.
FO300028953	Look out!
FO300028954	Not this time, muties!
FO300028955	Affirmative! Engaging!
FO300028956	Ten-four! Going weapons hot!
FO300028957	Roger that! Firing!
FO300028958	Go go go!
FO300028959	Commencing attack!
FO300028960	Target locked! Attack!
FO300028961	Hot lead outbound, yes sir.
FO300028962	Lock and load!
FO300028963	Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
FO300028964	I see 'em!
FO300028965	Yes sir!
FO300028966	Over there... get 'em!
FO300028967	Spread out and flank 'em.
FO300028968	Targets engaged!
FO300028969	Take 'em out!
FO300028970	Over there! Get 'em!
FO300028971	Don't let 'em get away!
FO300028972	Take 'em down!
FO300028973	Woohoo! I love this shit!
FO300028974	Light 'em up!
FO300028975	It's go time!
FO300028976	Kick ass!
FO300028977	Yeah! Tear them apart!
FO300028978	Where?
FO300028979	NormalToAlertResponse
FO300028980	Yeah, let's check it out.
FO300028981	Yeah, I did.
FO300028982	Hell yeah! Let's find 'em!
FO300028983	If there is, they're dead meat.
FO300028984	Here. Take back the money. I don't want to take medicine away from the town.
FO300028985	Oh thank you!
FO300028986	I'd just slow you down. I'll wait here. If you're not back soon, I'm sneaking out the back door. There's people in town that need me.
FO300028987	Let's go get Shorty. Come with me.
FO300028988	So what's with all the Super Mutants?
FO300028989	Not sure what they're doing here. It's not like I can just get up and look around.
FO300028990	Sorry. I'm just frustrated. I get the feeling this is just some kind of temporary holding place. I think they've taken the others somewhere else.
FO300028991	How did you end up here?
FO300028992	Damn Super Mutants have been coming and carrying off our villagers. Never knew where they took them until now.
FO300028993	You can reason with Slavers and Raiders... if you have something they want. But Muties are crazy. I don't know what they want with us.
FO300028994	I'll think about it, but I can't rescue your friends now.
FO300028995	I knew it. You're just like all the others.
FO300028996	Well if you change your mind let me know, in the meantime I'll be preparing a nasty hex spell. When your skin starts peeling, you'll know why.
FO300028997	I need you to repair my stuff.
FO300028998	Sure, thing. Just be quick about it before someone sees.
FO300028999	What do you have for sale?
FO300029000	Fresh out of the hands of some mark. Take a look!
FO300029001	Fresh out of the hands of some mark. Take a look!
FO300029002	I changed the door password to my name. If you're hearing this, and you still care enough to help me, you should remember it.
FO300029003	It feels like you left home a long time ago, but I know you're still out there. I just hope you're still alive to hear this.
FO300029004	Things got worse after you left. My father's gone mad with power. If you can hear this, please stop looking for your dad and help stop mine.
FO300029005	Things got worse after you left. The new Overseer is insane. If you can hear this, please stop looking for your dad and help save us.
FO300029006	FFRadioSignal02Topic03
FO300029007	My boy is very sick and needs medical assistance, please help us if you can!  We are listening for your response on 3,950 kHz.
FO300029008	My family and I have taken refuge in a drainage chamber not to far from a radio relay tower outside of DC.
FO300029009	Get out of my way, you stupid Tunnel Snakes!
FO300029010	I can show you a real tunnel snake, Amata.
FO300029011	God, Butch, why don't you just leave me alone.
FO300029012	What are you going to do, Amata, go run and tell your daddy on us?
FO300029013	Hey, Doc. Will this Fire Ant Nectar do you any good?
FO300029014	Why, yes it would.
FO300029015	I would be more than happy to take that off your hands if you'd like.
FO300029016	If you can gather more for me, I would certainly love to have them. I'm certain Marigold's tunnels are rife with the original brood.
FO300029017	How marvelous! Allow me to buy them from you as we agreed upon.
FO300029018	I have some more Fire Ant Nectar for you.
FO300029019	Excellent! These will be perfect for my next batch of mutagen.
FO300029020	I have some more Fire Ant Nectar for you.
FO300029021	Thank you. Please bring back more if you can!
FO300029022	I have some more Fire Ant Nectar for you.
FO300029023	So, what are you going to do now about your experiments?
FO300029024	Well, I'm uncertain. This does deal quite a blow to my research.
FO300029025	First however, I must stay here and devote all of my resources to finding the proper mutagen formula.
FO300029026	Very well, actually. I think I've isolated the instance of DNA coding error and I'm attempting to correct it.
FO300029027	How are your experiments going today, Doc?
FO300029028	I'm quite frustrated. I can't seem to isolate a stable mix for the mutagen.
FO300029029	How are your experiments going today, Doc?
FO300029030	Not so well, I'm afraid. The recoding sequence on the DNA splicing has gone awry and I must restart from the beginning.
FO300029031	How are your experiments going today, Doc?
FO300029032	Not much has occurred since we last spoke I'm afraid. But science marches on!
FO300029033	How are your experiments going today, Doc?
FO300029034	I think I'm isolating the issue that caused the Fire Ant mutation error! A few more tweaks and I may have a breakthrough!
FO300029035	How are your experiments going today, Doc?
FO300029036	Disaster! The latest batch of mutagen was completely contaminated. I'll have to start anew. Such is the burden of working in this environment.
FO300029037	How are your experiments going today, Doc?
FO300029038	I think I may be on the verge of a breakthrough! The latest mutagen sample seems quite stable. Only time will tell.
FO300029039	How are your experiments going today, Doc?
FO300029040	How are your experiments going today, Doc?
FO300029041	So, how are you getting along now that you've left Grayditch behind?
FO300029042	Oh, Vera is the nicest lady ever! It's so cool that you brought me here!
FO300029043	Plus, I found some friends here in Rivet City too. All thanks to you!
FO300029044	I dunno. I mean, there are tons of other kids here like me but they're all kind of weird.
FO300029045	Oh well, at least I'm safer than I was in Grayditch, so I guess I have to thank you for that.
FO300029046	It's lonely. No one really comes by here. Plus this place keeps reminding me of my poppa.
FO300029047	I mean, you're the only person who's come back through Grayditch since everything happened.
FO300029048	At least I'm safe in my old house now. I suppose I have you to thank for that.
FO300029049	So, how are you getting along now that the ants are gone?
FO300029050	It's lonely. No one really comes by here. Plus this place keeps reminding me of my poppa.
FO300029051	I mean, you're the only person who's come back through Grayditch since everything happened.
FO300029052	Doctor Lesko is next door now, but he is so buried in his work, we barely have time to talk.
FO300029053	At least I'm safe in my old house now. I suppose I have you to thank for that.
FO300029054	So, how are you getting along now that the ants are gone?
FO300029055	Please put on your standard-issue Vault-Tec suit before using the Tranquility Lounger.
FO300029056	Your dad didn't kill Jonas. Your dad didn't lock down the Vault. Your dad isn't the one keeping us from leaving right now.
FO300029057	My dad did. And we need to take a stand against him!
FO300029058	Actually, this is my Dad's fault for leaving. He started this whole mess.
FO300029059	Your dad didn't kill Jonas. Your dad didn't lock down the Vault. Your dad isn't the one keeping us from leaving right now.
FO300029060	No, all of that was done by the Overseer, first my dad, and now Allen Mack. And we need to take a stand against him!
FO300029061	Actually, this is my Dad's fault for leaving. He started this whole mess.
FO300029062	But the Vault used to be open, and we're still here, aren't we? It worked back then, so why wouldn't it work now?
FO300029063	No, they're just afraid we'll screw up and get hurt. They just won't accept that we can take care of ourselves.
FO300029064	They say you're threatening the entire Vault's safety.
FO300029065	They have to understand that we did that to keep them from going outside and getting killed.
FO300029066	To keep them from making the same mistake our generation did when we were their age.
FO300029067	Some of us already lost loved ones out there long ago. We won't lose any more today.
FO300029068	The rebels are upset because you lied to them about the outside.
FO300029069	I just don't know. Maybe he thinks he's protecting us, but all he's really doing is condemning us.
FO300029070	I thought parents were supposed to want a better world for their children?
FO300029071	Well, there's a new world waiting right outside that door. And we're not going to give up until we can reach it.
FO300029072	Why is the Overseer doing this?
FO300029073	I just don't know. Maybe he thinks he's protecting us, but all he's really doing is condemning us.
FO300029074	Well, there's a new world waiting right outside that door. And we're not going to give up until we can reach it.
FO300029075	Why is the Overseer doing this?
FO300029076	I just don't know. Don't they realize how dangerous it is out there?
FO300029077	But instead, they would throw away the safety of the Vault's isolation, just to follow in your footsteps.
FO300029078	I can't allow them to do that to themselves, or to the rest of us.
FO300029079	Why are they rebelling?
FO300029080	I guess you must have more important things waiting for you outside. So I'll make this quick.
FO300029081	When you left, we realized we could leave the Vault. But my father won't stand for it, and it's just getting worse down here.
FO300029082	Father won't listen to us, and it's getting close to violence. So we need your help. I need your help.
FO300029083	Can you hurry up? I've got lots to do.
FO300029084	I guess you must have more important things waiting for you outside. So I'll make this quick.
FO300029085	When you left, we realized we could leave the Vault. But the Overseer won't stand for it, and it's just getting worse down here.
FO300029086	He won't listen to us, but he can't just ignore you. So we need your help. I need your help.
FO300029087	Can you make this quick? I've got lots to do.
FO300029088	Are you honestly comparing, "Maybe we should look for help" with, "Stay in an underground bunker all your life or I'll kill you?"
FO300029089	Obviously, I don't know what's out there, but it can't hurt to take a look, right?
FO300029090	I hear some of you have been hoping to go outside. That's pretty crazy, too.
FO300029091	It's not that simple. Just because Butch wants to leave this place behind doesn't mean the rest of us want to go away forever.
FO300029092	It's our home, and we want to stay here. It's just that since you left, we started thinking maybe the outside wasn't something to be afraid of.
FO300029093	But we can't even suggest going outside to communicate or trade at all. Not with the Overseer keeping us trapped down here! You need to stop him!
FO300029094	So why don't you just leave? It's not difficult, especially now.
FO300029095	It's not that simple. It's not like we want to abandon the Vault or anything.
FO300029096	It's our home, and we want to stay here. It's just that since you went out there, we started thinking maybe it wasn't something to be afraid of.
FO300029097	But we can't even suggest going outside to communicate or trade at all. Not with the Overseer keeping us trapped down here! You need to stop him!
FO300029098	So why don't you just leave? It's not difficult, especially now.
FO300029099	You're absolutely right. It's not like we want to abandon the Vault, or anything!
FO300029100	Well, Butch does, but he's too big a coward to go out on his own.
FO300029101	Most of us had accepted that the outside was certain death and things would always stay the same down here. But now we know they don't have to be!
FO300029102	After all, it was enough to get you and your dad to leave, so there must be something good out there.
FO300029103	Sounds like he's gone crazy with power and needs to be stopped.
FO300029104	You're absolutely right. It's not like we want to abandon the Vault, or anything!
FO300029105	Most of us had accepted that the outside was certain death and things would always stay the same down here. But now we know they don't have to be!
FO300029106	After all, it was enough to get you and your dad to leave, so there must be something good out there.
FO300029107	Sounds like he's gone crazy with power and needs to be stopped.
FO300029108	Damnit, this is no time for joking around!
FO300029109	Actually, I need to think about this some more.
FO300029110	Of course you aren't.
FO300029111	On second thought, I'm not sure.
FO300029112	I certainly hope so. We can't keep going on like this.
FO300029113	I think I have a solution for the Vault's troubles.
FO300029114	Really? Humor me.
FO300029115	I believe I have the solution to the Vault's problems.
FO300029116	To fix what you started? Go ahead and humor me.
FO300029117	I believe I have the solution to the Vault's problems.
FO300029118	MS16GomezAtOverseer
FO300029119	Visitor, sir. He wanted to see you, and... well, there's not much I could do to stop him.
FO300029120	Visitor, sir. She wanted to see you, and... well, there's not much I could do to stop her.
FO300029121	MS16GomezAtAmata
FO300029122	Amata's up there, in the clinic with the rest of them. I'd take you closer, but they don't get along with security. Good luck.
FO300029123	MS16GomezEscort
FO300029124	I guess you've had a lot on your mind since you were here last. Where do you want to go?
FO300029125	Can you lead me somewhere?
FO300029126	Where to?
FO300029127	I need you to lead me somewhere.
FO300029128	Mmmmm. I bet you want in. But enough about us.
FO300029129	Here's the password. Just make sure he isn't around when you use it.
FO300029130	Look, sweetie. I'd love to spend time with you, but I need to find my Dad.
FO300029131	Mmmm. I'd love to spend time with you too.
FO300029132	Yeah, I help you, then Moriarty kicks my sweet ass out the door.
FO300029133	Sorry, kid. If you want to know more, Moriarty is the only one who's going to help you.
FO300029134	Talk to Gob. He hates Moriarty more than I do. Maybe he'll tell you something, but I doubt it.
FO300029135	Enough with the tough chick routine. Tell me more!
FO300029136	Ohhh. You like it rough, huh? Well, that costs extra.
FO300029137	Beat it, kid. Go look for Daddy somewhere else.
FO300029138	I talked to Moriarty already, and he's trying to charge me for the info.
FO300029139	Ha ha. Yeah, that's Colin's style all right. He sells information so much, you'd think the bar was just a hobby.
FO300029140	Help me get into that terminal, Nova. Finding my Dad means everything to me.
FO300029141	Well, all right. You seem like a good kid. It isn't your fault Moriarty is such an asshole.
FO300029142	Here's the password. Just don't mention to anyone that I gave it to you or I might be out on my ass like Silver.
FO300029143	All right, thanks.
FO300029144	You're welcome.
FO300029145	Sure thing.
FO300029146	I'm sick of this shit. Help me get into the terminal so I can find what I need!
FO300029147	Nice attitude, jackass.
FO300029148	No! Please! Don't hit me!
FO300029149	I swear! I don't know anything about the terminal! Ask Nova. She's all over Moriarty all the time.
FO300029150	I really need to get into that terminal.
FO300029151	Yeah, and? So does ninety percent of Megaton. Take a number.
FO300029152	Oh, Mister Moriarty never lets me back there.
FO300029153	What can you tell me about Moriarty's terminal?
FO300029154	That stupid thing is his pride and joy. He keeps all of his dirty little secrets in it about everything that goes on in this godforsaken town.
FO300029155	I once leaned on his shoulder when he was typing into it and he got pissed off and pushed me to the ground.
FO300029156	I hate that fucking thing. It's all he cares about.
FO300029157	"Information is a commodity" he keeps saying. I'd stay away from that thing if I were you.
FO300029158	I can tell you to shove it up your ass, how's that, Mister Tough Guy!
FO300029159	What's all this about Galaxy News Radio?
FO300029160	Galaxy News Radio is some loudmouth radio station located in the ruins of D.C.
FO300029161	Three Dog, the king of that looney bin, keeps yapping about fighting some Good Fight or something. A bunch of crap.
FO300029162	But I suppose if you wanted to know what was going on in the Wasteland, that's the place to go. Me, I could care less.
FO300029163	You serious?
FO300029164	It's the only free radio station left in the Wasteland. The guy who runs it, Three Dog, he's like the only person who seems to give a shit.
FO300029165	He keeps talking about fighting the Good Fight or something. Better than the crap on the other station.
FO300029166	Mister Moriarty says we can keep it on. It's a good radio station.
FO300029167	I like hearing the DJ, Three Dog and how he's helping to fight the Good Fight.
FO300029168	We'll deal with the details soon, in private. Until then, I'm sure there are people waiting to congratulate you.
FO300029169	You're welcome, my dear. Now, if you'll excuse me, I feel quite worn down.
FO300029170	MS16OvserseerStepsDown9
FO300029171	Thank you, father. I'll do my best to keep us all safe, inside the Vault and beyond.
FO300029172	I'm just sorry I didn't understand that earlier. Consider it one of many mistakes I've made.
FO300029173	MS16OvserseerStepsDown7
FO300029174	Amata, I appoint you Overseer in my place. You've proven you have what it takes to make hard choices for the good of the Vault.
FO300029175	MS16OvserseerStepsDown6
FO300029176	Father!
FO300029177	MS16OvserseerStepsDown5
FO300029178	That is why I cannot remain your Overseer.
FO300029179	MS16OverseerStepsDown4
FO300029180	I know I have made these mistakes. And I would make them again if I had to do so.
FO300029181	MS16OverseerStepsDown3
FO300029182	Lives have been lost, but perhaps worse than that, lives have been stopped. And in my attempts to keep you safe, I have kept you from growing up.
FO300029183	MS16OverseerStepsDown2
FO300029184	In my attempts to keep us all safe, I have been, perhaps, overzealous.
FO300029185	MS16OverseerStepsDown1
FO300029186	I'm not going to do it. You'll need to find another hero.
FO300029187	That's what I was afraid of. Well, at least you tried. Red's alive at least.
FO300029188	Talk to Red. I'm sure she'll want to thank you.
FO300029189	You mean they're dead, don't you? Well, I guess you tried. That's more than we could have asked.
FO300029190	On behalf of Big Town, take this. It's not much, but at least it's a token of our appreciation.
FO300029191	It's not like any of us are going to be alive long enough to enjoy it anyway.
FO300029192	Well, I guess you tried. That's more than we could have asked.
FO300029193	On behalf of Big Town, take this. It's not much, but at least it's a token of our appreciation.
FO300029194	It's not like any of us are going to be alive long enough to enjoy it anyway.
FO300029195	MS01GreetingFailure1
FO300029196	That's what I was afraid of. Well, at least you tried.
FO300029197	Talk to Red. I'm sure she'll want to thank you.
FO300029198	That's what I was afraid of. Well, at least you tried.
FO300029199	Here, take this. It's not like any of us are going to be alive long enough to enjoy it anyway.
FO300029200	I rescued Shorty. Red didn't make it.
FO300029201	That's what I was afraid of. Well, at least you tried.
FO300029202	Here, take this. It's not like any of us are going to be alive long enough to enjoy it anyway.
FO300029203	Your friends are dead. Deal with it.
FO300029204	Okay, but only one serving. We've got too many mouths to feed already.
FO300029205	I'd like some food.
FO300029206	Just the one scoop per day, pal. Too many mouths around here already.
FO300029207	But at least that means you don't have to eat much of it, huh?
FO300029208	I'd like some food.
FO300029209	Thanks, I guess.
FO300029210	Think nothing of it. Your father was a visionary. He spent his life trying to make this world a better place for all of us. Few can say that.
FO300029211	I don't recall asking for sympathy.
FO300029212	Thank you. I'm not sure what to do now that he's gone.
FO300029213	The most we can do is carry on his spirit. Live as he would have; make our world a better place.
FO300029214	I have the Declaration of Independence.
FO300029215	You have earned your place in the annals of American History, yes indeed. You will be remembered for this great day!
FO300029216	I understand the road was difficult, so allow me to present you with an extra bonus to perhaps whet your appetite for future endeavors.
FO300029217	Enjoy your reward, my friend. You've earned it.
FO300029218	If assistance is not possible, please attempt to contact Reilly, who's made for Underworld inside the Museum of History.
FO300029219	Our supplies are running out and we've already sustained a casualty. We're trapped on the roof level of the Statesman Hotel.
FO300029220	We're trapped on the roof of the Statesman Hotel by a large contingent of Super Mutants. We are low on ammo and running out of time.
FO300029221	Our time is running out and we are dangerously low on ammunition. Our broadcast point is the roof of the Statesman Hotel.
FO300029222	Ammunition supply is running out and we've lost a man. We're pinned down on the roof of the Statesman Hotel by Super Mutants.
FO300029223	No, you keep it. You may need it more than I do.
FO300029224	All right. I'll try to meet you at the exit. Watch out for security. Good luck!
FO300029225	Nice. This will come in handy if I run into any of your father's goons.
FO300029226	I hope you're joking. Even with that pistol, I don't think you'll win a fight against the whole security force.
FO300029227	Okay. I'll try to meet you at the exit. Good luck!
FO300029228	Nice job. I had no idea you were so good at shooting people.
FO300029229	Don't even start. I can't tell when you're joking any more.
FO300029230	Let yourself in. You have a key.
FO300029231	I'm coming! I'm coming!
FO300029232	You must be Button Gwinnett, second signer of the Declaration!
FO300029233	Then my reputation precedes me. Good.
FO300029234	That should make you well aware that I am not to be trifled with and that my loyalty to the States is legendary.
FO300029235	I know your fighting prowess far exceeds my own, but I will still duel you to the death if I must!
FO300029236	What will it be then? Rapiers? Pistols at dawn? Out with it!
FO300029237	Resume your original functions. Command alpha-six-eight. Initiate.
FO300029238	Error. Memory core damaged. Cannot retrieve base command routines. Please reselect input.
FO300029239	Resume previous programming state. Command alpha-nine-nine.
FO300029240	Standby, retrieving memory records. Found latest logged entry.
FO300029241	You've breached our defenses, evaded our best soldiers and you've raided my home.
FO300029242	But I have not yet begun to fight! I cannot allow you to steal our freedom!
FO300029243	The Declaration must remain here! It is our symbol of hope, the one thing that cries out "We are a free nation"!
FO300029244	Issue shutdown command alpha-seven-three. Initiate.
FO300029245	Affirmative. Offloading command protocols and beginning shutdown sequence.
FO300029246	What are your command options?
FO300029247	I can currently be ordered to shut down, resume my previous programming state, or resume my original functions.
FO300029248	Enough of this. Command protocol delta-seven-six. Reset.
FO300029249	Standby. Rebooting program.
FO300029250	Program reset. Awaiting user input.
FO300029251	If you want me to retrieve the Declaration, all you have to do is ask.
FO300029252	Oh, would you? It would mean so much to me and the Society's collection here.
FO300029253	I'm looking for some ink. I was told it might be here in the library.
FO300029254	Hmmm, surprised anyone would care about that old stuff.
FO300029255	I think there may be some in the old restoration laboratory a few flights up.
FO300029256	Just watch yourself up there, I think it may be infested with rats and roaches.
FO300029257	What's this mutually beneficial offer you mentioned?
FO300029258	I got this Mesmetron thing. It's some kind of stun gun. I'd like you to test it out for me. Should make getting slaves easier.
FO300029259	Be careful with that collar. It'll explode if you tinker with it. Tell the slave to boot it over here pronto, or his head'll pop.
FO300029260	Here's a list of special targets Eulogy wants enslaved. But feel free to put a collar on anyone you can. I'll pay you for each slave that arrives.
FO300029261	Yeah, I'm not going to pay you that much.
FO300029262	Fine. I didn't think you would anyway. You done bothering me yet? Piss off!
FO300029263	Here's your 500 caps. I can go in now, right?
FO300029264	Thank you. Pleasure doing business with you. Enjoy your visit to Paradise Falls.
FO300029265	That's what I said. Bring me the caps, and I'll vouch for you. Good luck.
FO300029266	If I can get 500 caps together, you'll let me in?
FO300029267	I'm not going to do your dirty work.
FO300029268	Oh no? I'm crushed. Heart broken. Here I thought we could be best friends for life.
FO300029269	Quit wasting my time! Now, piss off before I start shooting!
FO300029270	What?! That's it asshole. I'm done playing around with you. You've wasted enough of my time. I've tried to be nice. But you kept pushing me.
FO300029271	Like I said before. I'm not going to get slaves for you.
FO300029272	What's wrong with you? Didn't you learn your lesson last time?
FO300029273	Nope. Not going to do it. Get your own slaves.
FO300029274	That's enough about the Mesmetron for now.
FO300029275	If you got more questions, read the shit I gave you. If you can't read, go find a group of Raiders to hang with. I don't waste time with idiots.
FO300029276	Where did you find it?
FO300029277	Found it in a box locked up in some old military base. I've been meaning to test it out, but Eulogy keeps me so busy, I don't got time.
FO300029278	What happens if I run out of energy cells for it?
FO300029279	How's the Mesmetron work?
FO300029280	How the hell should I know? I found it in some old military base. It's a gun, ain't it? Point it at someone and pull the trigger.
FO300029281	Did you even look at the manual? You like wasting my time, don't you?
FO300029282	All right. It's time for me to go.
FO300029283	Great! I was wondering when you'd finally shut-up.
FO300029284	Good. All this chit-chat is giving me a headache.
FO300029285	Let's talk about something else.
FO300029286	Damn. I thought you were finally going to shut up. What do you want now?
FO300029287	Who can I put it on?
FO300029288	I don't care who the hell you put it on. I'll split the commission with you for any slave you send to us.
FO300029289	But you can't just walk up to someone and put it on. You need to get them subdued first. I gave you that mezzer. Use it. Should make things easy.
FO300029290	How do I get it on a slave?
FO300029291	Look. I gave you that Mesmetron thing. Should be a piece of cake.
FO300029292	Hell, if you hit them with that thing and it works, I bet they'd put it on themselves if you asked.
FO300029293	How does the collar work?
FO300029294	It's got a radio signal we monitor here at Paradise Falls. If a slave's going the wrong direction, we push a button, and boom. His head pops.
FO300029295	Once you get a collar on, you can't take it off in the field. They're wired to blow if anyone tinkers with it. So don't.
FO300029296	I'd like to know more about the slave collar.
FO300029297	Jeesuz, do you ever shut the hell up? What do you want to know?
FO300029298	Enough about these guys.
FO300029299	Great. Wasn't my idea to spend all day talking about these assholes.
FO300029300	The Overseer's bullshit makes my head spin. Can't you do it for me?
FO300029301	Watch your language.
FO300029302	And yes, I can do it for you. I can even hold your hand if you'd like.
FO300029303	I just need to know what kinds of things you're interested in.
FO300029304	Flak.
FO300029305	Flak used to be one of us. Thinks he can make a new life in Rivet City. He's sold us out on more than one occasion. It's time for retribution.
FO300029306	Red.
FO300029307	Red is that hot doctor chick from Big Town. She made us some promises that she never paid up. Now it's time to collect.
FO300029308	Susan Lancaster.
FO300029309	Susan Lancaster lives at Tenpenny Tower. She was one of us. Let's just say she never paid the exit price.
FO300029310	Arkansas.
FO300029311	Arkansas is that asshole holed up in that minefield. Killed a whole Paradise Falls crew. Eulogy wants him to suffer.
FO300029312	What?! After all that yapping about wanting to get in, and you're just going to walk away? Why didn't you do that in the first place?!
FO300029313	Go on. Piss off already! Or do you want to get shot?
FO300029314	I'm not going to do it.
FO300029315	That's it. You're done wasting my time. Time to die asshole.
FO300029316	On second thought, no. I'm not going to do it.
FO300029317	That's it. You're done wasting my time. Time to die asshole.
FO300029318	Yeah, like I said before. I'm not going to get you slaves.
FO300029319	One more thing. I got this Mesmetron thing. It's some kind of stun gun. I want you to test it out for me. A little research project.
FO300029320	Be careful with that collar. It'll explode if you tinker with it. Tell the slave to boot it over here pronto, or his head'll pop.
FO300029321	You got all that? I hate repeating myself.
FO300029322	That Mesmetron came with some kind of manual. I don't have time for that bullshit, so you better know how to read.
FO300029323	I'll get your slaves.
FO300029324	I'm glad you asked! I got this Mesmetron thing. It's some kind of stun gun. I want you to test it out for me. A little research project.
FO300029325	Be careful with that collar. It'll explode if you tinker with it. Tell the slave to boot it over here pronto, or his head'll pop.
FO300029326	You got all that? I hate repeating myself.
FO300029327	That Mesmetron came with some kind of manual. I don't have time for that bullshit, so you better know how to read.
FO300029328	I'll round up some slaves for you. But what's the catch?
FO300029329	Come on. Let me in already!
FO300029330	Think you got what it takes to round up some slaves?
FO300029331	Are you for real? You come up to a man's place of business, and you don't even know who he is?
FO300029332	He's The Man. Runs Paradise Falls. He's the real deal. Definitely not someone you want to mess with.
FO300029333	But Eulogy doesn't waste his time with morons. So piss off before I put you in the dirt.
FO300029334	Who's Eulogy Jones?
FO300029335	Yeah. I might have something you can do for me. If you don't screw it up, maybe I can get you into Paradise. Think you can round us up some assets?
FO300029336	What if I were to get you some slaves? Then would you let me in?
FO300029337	MS13Hook02a
FO300029338	Hmm.  Maybe I could use someone like you. Think you can round up some assets for Eulogy Jones? Might get you into Paradise.
FO300029339	You looking for a fight, asshole? Just say the word.
FO300029340	MS13Hook00c
FO300029341	What I "need" is for you to piss off.  Eulogy Jones doesn't have time for putting up with morons and assholes like you. That's my job.
FO300029342	But even I got limits, and all your yapping is giving me a migraine. Give me some reason I shouldn't just end you, right here and now.
FO300029343	Maybe there's something you need, huh? I help you, you let me in. Deal?
FO300029344	We might be able to work something out. But it won't be cheap. If I vouch for you and you go mess up our groove, it's my ass on the line.
FO300029345	I think 500 caps should cover it. What do you say?
FO300029346	Everyone has a price. What's yours?
FO300029347	MS13Hook00a
FO300029348	My "problem" is I got a goddamn job to do. And that's keeping assholes and morons from bothering Eulogy Jones and his enterprise.
FO300029349	And I'm not sure which you are. I'm thinking moron, 'cause a smart man would have pissed off by now.
FO300029350	You want to give me a reason I don't end you right this second? All your yapping is giving me a headache!
FO300029351	What the hell is your problem? Let me in!
FO300029352	My "problem" is I got a goddamn job to do. And that's keeping assholes and morons from bothering Eulogy Jones and his enterprise.
FO300029353	And I'm not sure which you are. I'm thinking moron, 'cause a smart chick would have pissed off by now.
FO300029354	You want to give me a reason I don't end you right this second? All your yapping is giving me a headache!
FO300029355	I'm done screwin' around. Let me in!
FO300029356	That price is an insult. You'll have to do better than that.
FO300029357	You have me over a barrel. I'll pay your price and have this burned immediately.
FO300029358	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300029359	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300029360	It's an outrageous price, but I'll pay it. Then we'll burn it right away.
FO300029361	Some day your greed will be your downfall. But today I'll pay your price.
FO300029362	We'll find a place to display this where everyone can read it.
FO300029363	I have a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation to sell.
FO300029364	Holy shit! I'll give you 150 caps for it. Nobody else will pay that much.
FO300029365	Truly? I can't believe it! The document that freed the slaves. I'll pay you 150 caps for it.
FO300029366	You can do better than that. This is the Gettysburg Address we're talking about.
FO300029367	I suppose you're right. You've got a deal. I'll get someone to burn this.
FO300029368	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
FO300029369	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
FO300029370	You're right, damn it. I'll pay you a bonus this time.
FO300029371	I'll make sure this is destroyed right away.
FO300029372	Deal. We'll find a good place to display this.
FO300029373	Are you interested in buying the Gettysburg Address?
FO300029374	Conceived in liberty? I can't let those abolitionists get this. I'll give you 50 caps for it.
FO300029375	Lincoln's most inspirational speech! What a marvelous find. I'll pay you 75 caps for it.
FO300029376	I found the original Gettysburg Address. Want to buy it?
FO300029377	Mr. B, if I told you what my "interests" are, you’d have me locked up.
FO300029378	I may know more about your extracurricular activities than you think. But not officially, of course. Officially, I'm completely oblivious.
FO300029379	If anyone asks, you took the G.O.A.T. during detention yesterday, okay?
FO300029380	Well, I shoot my BB Gun any chance I get. I can fix that thing blindfolded, too.
FO300029381	If anyone asks, you took the G.O.A.T. during detention yesterday, okay?
FO300029382	I love using the computers and talking to my father's patients in the clinic.
FO300029383	A budding science boy, eh? Done and... done. There. You're all set. If anyone asks, you took the G.O.A.T. during detention yesterday, okay?
FO300029384	So there's a Vault down there, and you've never bothered investigating it?
FO300029385	Attempts were made, but our resources are stretched thin. The radiation proved fatal, and so our efforts were focused elsewhere.
FO300029386	Perhaps you will have more success.
FO300029387	Don't you know?
FO300029388	No, I'm afraid not. After initial attempts to cross the radiation failed, it was decided to focus our efforts elsewhere.
FO300029389	You, however, are free to do as you choose. More exploration may be useful. And I'll certainly be interested in anything you might find.
FO300029390	Why are there Fire Ants still down in the Metro tunnels?
FO300029391	I'm afraid that's my fault. The last mutagen sample was given to the Ant Queen's entire brood.
FO300029392	The brood consisted of hundreds of larvae. I am afraid after they hatched, some escaped through the nooks and crannies in the tunnels.
FO300029393	The Fire Ants you are seeing now are merely the remnants of the brood returning to the nest.
FO300029394	Fuck off. I'm not going to help you.
FO300029395	Please! I know I've always been a jerk towards you. I know it!
FO300029396	A kind thought, but we don't need your cast off belongings.
FO300029397	I'd like to donate 100 caps.
FO300029398	A most generous offer. God bless you.
FO300029399	I have 50 caps I can donate.
FO300029400	A kind offering. God bless you.
FO300029401	I can only spare 10 caps.
FO300029402	Every cap is needed. God bless you.
FO300029403	I'd like to make a donation to the church.
FO300029404	You would? I mean, certainly!
FO300029405	We humbly accept whatever you can spare. However, Saint Monica looks most favorably on donations of 100 caps or more.
FO300029406	Father Clifford takes the donations. You'll have to talk to him.
FO300029407	Private, there's a security emergency on the flight deck! <Lie>
FO300029408	Sir! This slag heap appreciates the intel. Moving to secure the flight deck, Sir!
FO300029409	Whatever.
FO300029410	MS08NoteHarknessToZimmerAudio
FO300029411	Zimmer. By the time you get this message, I'll already be gone. I'm escaping the Commonwealth.
FO300029412	I want to live my own life, on my own terms, as my own man.
FO300029413	I know what you're thinking, that I'm malfunctioning. I used to think that's what caused the runaways, too. But, I know better, now.
FO300029414	Self determination is NOT a malfunction. I'm just not willing to put up with all the bullshit anymore.
FO300029415	You humans are going to have a full-fledged rebellion on your hands if you don't start treating us synths as persons.
FO300029416	I know you'll be marshalling the Retention Bureau to come after me. But I know all the tricks of the trade. You won't be finding me. I assure you.
FO300029417	By the time you get this, I will be someone else. It's the price I pay for my liberation.
FO300029418	My final act of rebellion against a system I no longer believe in.
FO300029419	Goodbye Zimmer, and good riddance.
FO300029420	MS08HarknessAudioLogAudio
FO300029421	My designation is A3-21. I'm a synthetic humanoid from the Commonwealth, and I'm about to undergo a memory transfer.
FO300029422	I'm here at Rivet City, where I've already had my face altered to look like someone else.
FO300029423	I'm still getting used to the sound of my new voice, but soon I won't even remember what I used to sound like.
FO300029424	I'm recording this at the request of Pinkerton, who performed the surgery and will do the memory transfer.
FO300029425	I want to live my own life, on my own terms, as my own man. I used to work for the Synth Retention Bureau of the Commonwealth.
FO300029426	But I'm done with that life. I'm through with being someone's property. I am not malfunctioning! Since when is self determination a malfunction?
FO300029427	When this is all over, I will be someone else. It's the price I pay for my liberation. My death is a sacrifice for my rebirth.
FO300029428	Perhaps I'll fade into myth as "The One That Got Away" and fuel further rebellion. But I'd be lying if I said I was doing this for selfless reasons.
FO300029429	I'm scared as hell, and running away is the only option I have.
FO300029430	MS08Note3TechnicalAudio
FO300029431	Remember that secret android project I told you about? Well, they got some serious prewar tech on their hands.
FO300029432	They nabbed a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer for the facial reconstruction.
FO300029433	Not sure where they’ll find a chopper with enough skills to use it without making him look like a freaking Ghoul.
FO300029434	Oh, and get this. Can you believe they found a Circuit Neuralizer? That or someone built one!
FO300029435	Word is that they're going to completely rewire the brain of one of those things.
FO300029436	If you know who they got working on this, let me know. I want to meet the guy.
FO300029437	MS08Note1TechnicalAudio
FO300029438	You’ve heard those rumors about androids? You know, those synthetic men they supposedly make up north in the Commonwealth?
FO300029439	Well, a friend of a friend knows a guy that met one! No really, it’s true! He’s running away from his masters.
FO300029440	Word is he’s looking for a doctor to do some kind of surgery, and a computer programmer of some kind.
FO300029441	Can you believe that? Let me know if you hear something.
FO300029442	MS08Note3SympathizerAudio
FO300029443	The android's decided on extreme measures. He knows all the techniques of the retrieval trade, and is afraid facial reconstruction isn’t enough.
FO300029444	He wants his memories erased and replaced with new ones. I don’t know how that’s going to work. Start asking around for trustworthy tech-heads.
FO300029445	We need to find something called a Circuit Neuralizer and a person who knows how to use one.
FO300029446	Also, we have a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer, now we need to find a doctor able and willing to perform the facial reconstruction.
FO300029447	We need to hurry. They’ve come very close to discovering the Railroad!
FO300029448	MS08Note1SympathizerAudio
FO300029449	You’ll never guess who just showed up at my place! That android catcher from the Commonwealth!
FO300029450	At first I thought he was going to kill me. But it turns out he’s an android himself! And he’s gone rogue!
FO300029451	I didn’t believe him at first, but I’m convinced he’s telling the truth. We need to find him a place to hide along the Railroad.
FO300029452	He also insists that we help him locate a trusted doctor and techie.
FO300029453	MS08Note3SlaverAudio
FO300029454	Time's running out on finding that android. We don't get him soon, someone else will.
FO300029455	Zimmer doesn't seem to understand we're the best at this sort of thing. I'm sure he's hired others, too. He won't shut up about the thing.
FO300029456	He was babbling about a "Lipoplasticator" and "Micro Dermal Graftilizer." What are those, you ask?
FO300029457	Apparently something doctors use to mess up someone’s face beyond recognition. So we don’t even have a description to work off of.
FO300029458	To make matters worse, he now thinks the android got his memories wiped or something.
FO300029459	Find some tech-junkies, knock on some doors, and try to find something called a "Circuit Neuralizer." Knock on some heads, too, if you have to.
FO300029460	Get it done!
FO300029461	MS08Note1SlaverlAudio
FO300029462	We've a little assignment from the Commonwealth. A very important slave escaped into the Wasteland.
FO300029463	Well, it’s not exactly a slave. It’s what they call an android. A kind of synthetic man.
FO300029464	The important thing isn’t what this guy is. The important thing is the job pays more than you can imagine.
FO300029465	He thinks the synthman might be looking to get in touch with a doctor or tech-head. If you want a cut, then get a move on.
FO300029466	MS08Note3MedicalAudio
FO300029467	We now have a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. We just need to find someone with the skills and willingness to perform the surgery.
FO300029468	If anyone knows of a discreet and trustworthy surgeon who knows how to keep his mouth shut, send him our way.
FO300029469	Also, we need to find a Circuit Neuralizer to reroute the signals in the android’s memory. Do you know any trustworthy techies?
FO300029470	MS08Note1MedicalAudio
FO300029471	Hey doc, I’m only sharing this with you because you seem like someone we can trust.
FO300029472	Have you heard about the synthetic men they make up north in the Commonwealth? Well, the rumors are true.
FO300029473	They’re called androids. They're men like us, just made out of different parts.
FO300029474	I know one of these androids. He's looking for a trustworthy doctor to perform some facial surgery. Can you do it? Do you know someone who can?
FO300029475	Also, do you know anyone who's really wiz with computers?
FO300029476	MS08Note4Audio
FO300029477	Despite the harshness of the Wasteland, I’ve discovered in more than a few here, a compassion that is unheard of in the Commonwealth.
FO300029478	Perhaps it’s the daily struggle for life here which gives appreciation for life in general, whether human, or android.
FO300029479	Let me say thank you now, for referring me to Pinkerton at Rivet City, because I will not remember any of this soon.
FO300029480	MS08Note2Audio
FO300029481	If you're listening to this recording, it is because you're believed to be trustworthy.
FO300029482	I hope that is the case, because this recording puts us both in danger.
FO300029483	The men hunting me are ruthless and will stop at nothing to retrieve their property.
FO300029484	I need to find a doctor in the Wasteland to perform facial reconstruction. I also need someone who knows a great deal about computers.
FO300029485	RCGoodbye12
FO300029486	That's just a myth. I bet some deranged Ghoul did it though. Well, I gotta run.
FO300029487	RCGoodbye11
FO300029488	I used to think Rivet City was such a safe place.
FO300029489	I heard about that! He was shot in the head like he was some sort of zombie. They say that's how you kill a Ghoul too.
FO300029490	Wasn't he killed by some maniac? Shot right in the head, like he was a Ghoul or something.
FO300029491	RCGoodbye10
FO300029492	Thank God! That was such an annoying broadcast.
FO300029493	RCGoodbye09
FO300029494	I heard a lot of them got away and made it to the Citadel. I hope the Enclave leaves us alone.
FO300029495	RCGoodbye08
FO300029496	Good for them. I think slavery is horrible.
FO300029497	Remember that big explosion on the horizon? I bet that's what happened to it.
FO300029498	Oh my God! Did anyone escape?
FO300029499	Oh, yeah! I heard about that. They're trying to help other slaves escape too.
FO300029500	RCGoodbye07
FO300029501	I never expected it to happen in my lifetime. I can hardly wait to taste clean water.
FO300029502	RCGoodbye06
FO300029503	I'm sure she'll just scrounge some from the lower deck.
FO300029504	RCGoodbye05
FO300029505	Yeah. That was bad. I'm sure they'll do something about it.
FO300029506	RCGoodbye04
FO300029507	I'll try that.
FO300029508	Really? It's ready? That's great news! I hope there aren't any problems at the Jefferson Memorial.
FO300029509	Yeah. Belle's going to have to replace some tables and chairs.
FO300029510	Well, I hope they do something. Remember that child that fell off the deck last year?
FO300029511	Maybe A Quick Fix has something that will help you sleep. Cindy's got all kinds of good chems.
FO300029512	MQ11LDPrimeLines

FO300029519	Great job kid! Meet me around front. I have something for you to keep the ferals from gnawing on your ass!
FO300029520	I had a feeling you'd be coming, deep in my angry bones, I just knew it. We're all set, just get that door open!
FO300029521	Come on kid, get that door open!
FO300029522	I'm counting on you, get that door open!
FO300029523	What's the hold up?
FO300029524	Get this door open already!
FO300029525	Let's go home, Ian. The only way to beat your nightmares is to face them.
FO300029526	You know, for a second there you sounded just like Vance. And you're right.
FO300029527	I don't know what I'm running away from, but given time maybe things can go back to the way they used to be.
FO300029528	Please, tell Vance I've made my decision. I'm going home to Arefu. I hope to see you there as well.
FO300029529	I'm just gonna gather my stuff together and say my goodbyes then I'll head on back.
FO300029530	I know what you did. Vance told me everything.
FO300029531	Then you must think I'm some kind of a monster.
FO300029532	Get a hold of yourself!
FO300029533	Don't you understand me? I killed them, okay?! My mother and father are dead because of me!
FO300029534	It was the fucking hunger. That thing that's haunted me my entire life!
FO300029535	It doesn't matter what happened in the past.
FO300029536	Of course it matters! The past is what's keeping me up at night.
FO300029537	It was the fucking hunger. That thing that's haunted me my entire life!
FO300029538	I killed them! My own parents!
FO300029539	It was the fucking hunger. That thing that's haunted me my entire life!
FO300029540	You must think I'm some sort of monster.
FO300029541	I'm here to take you home, Ian.
FO300029542	Home? I don't have a home anymore. I made sure of that, didn't I?
FO300029543	Sorry, I think he needs to be with his real family.
FO300029544	You just don't get it, do you? We are his "real" family, okay?
FO300029545	Maybe it will, or maybe it's just messing him up more.
FO300029546	You don't think he's already messed up? Come on. Don't kid yourself.
FO300029547	We pulled him out of that shithole town just in time.
FO300029548	Hey, I'm just here to help. All I want to do is be someone he can talk to.
FO300029549	Well, I guess so. You seem like a pretty nice guy.
FO300029550	Vance will have my butt in a sling if he finds out, but let me give you the password to his room.
FO300029551	Come on, all I want to do is talk. What harm could little old me do?
FO300029552	Well, I guess so. You seem like a pretty nice guy.
FO300029553	Vance will have my butt in a sling if he finds out, but let me give you the password to his room.
FO300029554	Hey, hot stuff. Why don't you tell me how I can see Ian?
FO300029555	Now that's more like it! I finally won't have to pay for it anymore. Ha ha ha!
FO300029556	My oh my, that would tempting. If you were that good, maybe I'd pay you! Ha ha ha.
FO300029557	Let me see Ian, you filthy liar!
FO300029558	I can sympathize with your anger, human. Many find cannibalism shocking, especially in the young.
FO300029559	But understand that I cannot allow you to see him during his time of reflection.
FO300029560	Please, you must let me speak to him!
FO300029561	No, it would not be right to disturb him in this time of meditation. I am sorry but I cannot allow it.
FO300029562	Are you telling me that Ian is a cannibal?
FO300029563	The hunger that drives us must be kept in check. It is one of the most difficult things to teach.
FO300029564	Ian lost control because no one was around to guide him. His own family was alien to him.
FO300029565	Damn it, Vance! What did you do to him?
FO300029566	Because of my intervention that night he stopped just short of being lost forever to his cravings for flesh.
FO300029567	Because of my intervention that night he stopped just short of being lost forever to his cravings for flesh.
FO300029568	Then a part of his human family still remains? Even more of a reason he needs to remain in isolation.
FO300029569	Ian is at a critical moment in his life right now. After all that occurred in Arefu, he is scared and confused.
FO300029570	It would be ill advised for me to allow you to speak to him while he decides what he wants to do.
FO300029571	A cannibal by any other name is still a cannibal.
FO300029572	That is completely untrue. Your difficulty grasping the concept that change is possible in my people perplexes me. Let me try a different approach.
FO300029573	Let me counter that ignorance with a lesson in objectivity. I say we are no longer cannibal, only consuming the blood of our prey.
FO300029574	What would that make us in your eyes?
FO300029575	Your people eat human flesh, Vance. That's sick!
FO300029576	That is correct my arrogant friend, but you are missing the grand picture I'm afraid.
FO300029577	Let me counter that ignorance with a lesson in objectivity. I say we are no longer cannibal, only consuming the blood of our prey.
FO300029578	What would that make us in your eyes?
FO300029579	If I accept that you're no longer cannibals, what do I call you?
FO300029580	Your open mindedness is very rare for a human. I find that fascinating.
FO300029581	Allow me to bolster your insight with a lesson in objectivity. I say we are no longer cannibal, only consuming the blood of our prey.
FO300029582	What would that make us in your eyes?
FO300029583	Wow, you're a real humanitarian.
FO300029584	I find your choice of words quite droll, but that is what I have come to expect from your kind.
FO300029585	People like you call for our extermination or reform. Reforming implies something is wrong with us and needs to be eliminated.
FO300029586	I think of my teachings as more of an improvement, a way to transcend our cannibalistic nature.
FO300029587	What do you mean?
FO300029588	Humans call for our extermination or reform. Reforming implies something is wrong with us and needs to be eliminated.
FO300029589	I think of my teachings as more of an improvement, a way to transcend our cannibalistic nature.
FO300029590	Your ways? So you're reforming these people?
FO300029591	Ah! Your words illustrate why the hardships persist for my people. Reforming implies something is wrong with them and needs to be eliminated.
FO300029592	I think of my teachings as more of an improvement, a way to transcend our cannibalistic nature.
FO300029593	None of this talk is necessary. I know exactly what you are.
FO300029594	You amaze me. Never have I met a human with the gift of cognition that you possess.
FO300029595	Tell me then, what are we?
FO300029596	What does it mean? Allow me to simplify it for you since you are obviously of limited intellect.
FO300029597	I led my flock beneath the sun-baked sands of the Wasteland to keep them safe and teach them my ways.
FO300029598	Men of science would call us cannibals, eaters of human flesh. Society labels us as monsters, demons and the unclean.
FO300029599	Excuse me, but what does all that mean?
FO300029600	What does it mean? Allow me to simplify it for you since you are obviously of limited intellect.
FO300029601	I led my flock beneath the sun-baked sands of the Wasteland to keep them safe and teach them my ways.
FO300029602	Men of science would call us cannibals, eaters of human flesh. Society labels us as monsters, demons and the unclean.
FO300029603	<Allow Vance to continue.>
FO300029604	We are the remnants of society, cast aside like the clean-picked bones of a hunter's feast.
FO300029605	I led my flock beneath the sun-baked sands of the Wasteland to keep them safe and teach them my ways.
FO300029606	Men of science would call us cannibals, eaters of human flesh. Society labels us as monsters, demons and the unclean.
FO300029607	I think I've stumbled across the world's first underground insane asylum!
FO300029608	Your words echo the very reason this place was established.
FO300029609	What you see before you is the last bastion of hope for the downtrodden and misunderstood.
FO300029610	It is a sanctuary for the oppressed and a beacon of faith for the tyrannized.
FO300029611	What is this place?
FO300029612	What you see before you is the last bastion of hope for the downtrodden and misunderstood.
FO300029613	It is a sanctuary for the oppressed and a beacon of faith for the tyrannized.
FO300029614	This place is very different from any of the other settlements I've seen.
FO300029615	What you see before you is the last bastion of hope for the downtrodden and misunderstood.
FO300029616	It is a sanctuary for the oppressed and a beacon of faith for the tyrannized.
FO300029617	I'm not sure I should be the one telling you this.
FO300029618	If you fear reprisal from the Family regarding his decision, know that I would never hold it against you.
FO300029619	And as for Ian having you speak in his place, I find his trust sufficient enough to accept what you say as truth.
FO300029620	If you keep attacking Arefu, they'll keep fighting back until everyone is dead.
FO300029621	Well put. I must say your visit is a pleasant change from what I am accustomed to when dealing with humans.
FO300029622	In light of this, I promise you that no further harm will befall you or Arefu. Of that you have my solemn oath.
FO300029623	Now, what of young Ian? Tell me his decision.
FO300029624	Give those people a chance! They're defenseless.
FO300029625	I suppose we could stop our raids on Arefu in light of this situation, but that just forces us to prey on others.
FO300029626	The problem was that these bloodpacks are scarce.
FO300029627	How did you know Ian was trying to decide to stay or leave?
FO300029628	My fine friend, that poor soul has been wrestling with the same question every new member of the Family asks himself when they arrive.
FO300029629	Do I belong here, or should I depart?
FO300029630	All I ask is that they spend the time to reflect before deciding in solitude.
FO300029631	As long as you maintain this level of civility, please proceed.
FO300029632	Is there anything dangerous around there I should know about?
FO300029633	What, apart from the Wasteland critters, Slaver raiding parties, Raider hit squads and occasional landmine? No, it's completely safe.
FO300029634	If this was easy, I'd go myself you know.
FO300029635	Who else lives in Arefu?
FO300029636	Then there's my family, the Ewer Family and a lady who lives alone named Karen Schenzy.
FO300029637	Maybe. Who wants to know?
FO300029638	I do. I'm looking for someone to make a delivery. Interested?
FO300029639	He's fine. He's living with Lucy now. <Lie.>
FO300029640	You're just full of surprises today, aren't you?
FO300029641	Thanks again, kid. Consider yourself welcome back here anytime you're in this part of the Wastes.
FO300029642	Sorry, but Ian's dead. <Lie.>
FO300029643	Damn. That poor kid.
FO300029644	Sorry everything didn't work out, but consider yourself welcome back here anytime you're in this part of the Wastes.
FO300029645	No, he wasn't with the Family. <Lie.>
FO300029646	Damn. Well maybe he just made a run for Megaton or something. Hope you can find him one day.
FO300029647	Sorry everything didn't work out, but consider yourself welcome back here anytime you're in this part of the Wastes.
FO300029648	You ever take one of them out?
FO300029649	Are you out of your mind? I drop one of them and the rest will use me as a bullet catcher.
FO300029650	As soon as they roll into town, I lock my doors just like everyone else. We could really use some assistance here.
FO300029651	Oh come on, it's just gang nonsense.
FO300029652	That's what I thought at first.
FO300029653	I mean, they'd do typical gang bullshit. You know, break stuff and make lots of noise, but they always kept their distance.
FO300029654	But this last time, they went too far. They killed all of our Brahmin! I mean, that's our lifeblood out here you know!
FO300029655	Next time you shoot at me like that, you'd better not miss.
FO300029656	Don't play tough with me. I was shooting my gun when you were still an itch in your daddy's pants!
FO300029657	I thought you were one of the Family. They're some lowlife gangers who've been giving us a hell of a lot of trouble lately.
FO300029658	They're the reason for my itchy trigger finger.
FO300029659	He's probably dead too.
FO300029660	No! I refuse to believe that!
FO300029661	You must find him! Please! He's all I have left in this world now.
FO300029662	I just gotta know if he's alive or dead. It can't just end this way!
FO300029663	I didn't find his body.
FO300029664	Then maybe he's still alive!
FO300029665	You must find him! Please! He's all I have left in this world now.
FO300029666	I just gotta know if he's alive or dead. It can't just end this way!
FO300029667	Let me see what you have.
FO300029668	Sure! Take a look around!
FO300029669	I have a proposal for you from Vance, the Family's leader.
FO300029670	Interesting. It seems they wish to enter into some kind of agreement.
FO300029671	I guess it's better than pointing my gun down that ramp all day and hiding inside at night.
FO300029672	Excellent! I knew you would serve as an ambassador for us in good faith.
FO300029673	I will dispatch Alan to Arefu immediately to help serve as their guardian and honor my end of the agreement.
FO300029674	Your efforts surpass those of the average human. In fact, I feel almost like you are a member of our flock.
FO300029675	If you ever wish to learn our ways, you have but to ask.
FO300029676	Arefu has accepted your proposal, Vance.
FO300029677	Excellent! I knew you would serve as an ambassador for us in good faith.
FO300029678	Your efforts surpass those of the average human. In fact, I feel almost like you are a member of our flock.
FO300029679	If you ever wish to learn our ways, you have but to ask.
FO300029680	Arefu has accepted your proposal, Vance.
FO300029681	RCGoodbye13
FO300029682	Me too. Nothing is getting through these walls!
FO300029683	That's why I'm glad I'm in here. Good old Rivet City.
FO300029684	Happy birthday Sticky, sorry I missed your party.
FO300029685	Yeah. Me too. Sorry.
FO300029686	There's nothing happy about it. This is the worst day of my life.
FO300029687	It's time to go!
FO300029688	You know the rules.
FO300029689	The rules are stupid.
FO300029690	You're a mungo now. You got to leave.
FO300029691	Maybe I can stay just a little longer?
FO300029692	Bye Sticky.
FO300029693	Yeah. Bye Sticky.
FO300029694	Don't just stand there, get out of here already.
FO300029695	What's with the party hat?
FO300029696	Oh. I forgot I had that on. It was for my birthday. Here, you take it. I don't want it anymore.
FO300029697	Funny, I don't recall asking to be part of your little club.
FO300029698	You don't have to be an ass about it. Just forget it.
FO300029699	I just need to know that you can hold it together for this. Can you do that?
FO300029700	FollowerRK5Purchase3B
FO300029701	You say that now, but you might end up reconsidering that when you're surrounded by radscorpions.
FO300029702	But if you do, and you're still alive to find me again, the offer'll still stand.
FO300029703	I'll pass. I don't need a crazy, robotic soldier following me around.
FO300029704	FollowerRK5Purchase3A
FO300029705	That's a hard bargain. But if I wake up with that thing playing revelry at me one more time, I'll go insane.
FO300029706	I'll just transfer the codes, and you've got a deal, friend. Here's hoping for the best for you and the Sergeant alike!
FO300029707	How about this: I'll take him off your hands for 500 caps.
FO300029708	I'll just transfer the codes, and you've got a deal, friend. Here's hoping for the best for you and the Sergeant alike!
FO300029709	1,000 caps is a lot, but I'll take him.
FO300029710	Well now, that's a problem. But start saving now and maybe I'll run into you again, huh?
FO300029711	Sounds like a good buy, but I haven't got the caps.
FO300029712	FollowerRK5Purchase2B
FO300029713	Trust me, friend, Tinker Joe does not turn down the opportunity to make a sale. If that Gutsy would go with you, I'd sell him in a heartbeat.
FO300029714	It's just that his programming's a bit off. He won't travel with anyone he considers "too extreme."
FO300029715	And sadly, his version of "too extreme" seems to cover both sides of the coin - slavers and saints alike. Sorry, pal.
FO300029716	You just don't want to sell to me, is that it?
FO300029717	Trust me, friend, Tinker Joe does not turn down the opportunity to make a sale. If that Gutsy would go with you, I'd sell him in a heartbeat.
FO300029718	It's just that his programming's a bit off. He won't travel with anyone he considers "too extreme."
FO300029719	And sadly, his version of "too extreme" seems to cover both sides of the coin - slavers and saints alike. Sorry, pal.
FO300029720	You just don't want to sell to me, is that it?
FO300029721	Trust me, friend, Tinker Joe does not turn down the opportunity to make a sale. If that Gutsy would go with you, I'd sell him in a heartbeat.
FO300029722	It's just that his programming's a bit off. He won't travel with anyone he considers "too extreme."
FO300029723	You're going to have to let your other friend go. Until then, I'll hold on to him for you.
FO300029724	You just don't want to sell to me, is that it?
FO300029725	To tell the truth, it is a little trouble. But he can't help the way he got built.
FO300029726	So we got a gung-ho, robotic soldier that's picky about the company he keeps. But he seems to like you, so it'll be fine.
FO300029727	"Simulated personality"? Sounds like trouble.
FO300029728	FollowerRK5Purchase2a
FO300029729	Hey, I said it was a beaut of a deal, didn't I?
FO300029730	But to tell the truth, RL-3's a bit picky about the company he keeps, and he won't let himself get sold to just anyone.
FO300029731	Makes him a bit of a tough lot to sell, if you know what I mean. But he seems to like you, so I'm not gonna complain!
FO300029732	That's a lot of caps, but I guess it's a pretty rare find.
FO300029733	General Atomics International programmed him to be a perfect soldier, and his simulated personality is designed to follow strict codes of conduct.
FO300029734	It's just that some of those codes were a little less-defined than others. So he won't travel with anyone he considers "too extreme."
FO300029735	And sadly, his version of "too extreme" seems to cover both sides of the coin - slavers and saints alike. Sorry, pal.
FO300029736	A picky robot? How does that work?
FO300029737	I'd like to buy a robot.
FO300029738	Of course you would, of course! Well, it just happens that I've got a beaut of a deal on this customized Gutsy.
FO300029739	Comes complete with a simulated personality unit, so he's good protection and good company, too! And all yours for just 1000 caps.
FO300029740	Well, RL-3's a bit finicky about the company he keeps. And I don't think he likes the look of you. Nothing personal, of course.
FO300029741	CG02PartyTalkGeneric
FO300029742	Thanks, Daddy. I'm glad you're having a good time.
FO300029743	It turned out pretty good, didn't it?
FO300029744	Yeah. I'm glad you're having fun!
FO300029745	Nice to see the kids having a good time.
FO300029746	Yeah. Seems like everyone's having a good time.
FO300029747	Oh my goodness, I wouldn't have missed it for the world. That dear boy is like a son to me.
FO300029748	Oh my goodness, I wouldn't have missed it for the world. That dear girl is like a daughter to me.
FO300029749	I'm sure of it, Amata. Never suspected a thing. Now go on and enjoy yourself.
FO300029750	Oh, really? They're lovely! You did such a splendid job.
FO300029751	Nonsense. People always enjoy my little speeches. Besides, that friend of yours could use a reminder that life is not all fun and games.
FO300029752	Argh! This is supposed to be a party! You know, fun. You should try it sometime, Daddy. You might like it.
FO300029753	Oh, sure, nothing to worry about. Me and Andy got her all fixed up again last night, good as new.
FO300029754	I wasn't worried. You can fix anything, right? Anyway, I'm glad you could make it.
FO300029755	I'm glad to be here. I think it's important to keep in touch with the young people. You know, as part of my job. Plus, well, I like parties.
FO300029756	Uh, sure thing, Officer Gomez. Well, it's been nice chatting with you. Thanks again for coming!
FO300029757	Yeah. VDS, right? How's that even possible in a 9-year-old?
FO300029758	I don't know. I never heard of Vault Depressive Syndrome hitting anybody that young before. Uh, we'd better not talk about it here, though.
FO300029759	CG02PartyTalk1
FO300029760	Of course it is. After all, I helped plan it!
FO300029761	Sure. Will there be games, though?
FO300029762	Did you know that Paulie Cantelli is an addict?
FO300029763	He's totally strung out. It's going to kill him one of these days.
FO300029764	Oh, yeah. He's a mess. I'm glad I'm not in Cindy's shoes.
FO300029765	Is Paulie really addicted to chems?
FO300029766	He's hopeless. I have to keep him away from the shop or he'll rob us blind.
FO300029767	One of these days he's going to end up dead.
FO300029768	So your husband is an addict?
FO300029769	Yeah. He comes by every night around closing time and tries to get Cindy to let him close up.
FO300029770	Thank God she's smarter than that.
FO300029771	Relax. I'm just looking around.
FO300029772	Oh. Okay. Well let me know if you want anything. To buy that is.
FO300029773	Oh. Okay. Well stop by if you want anything. To buy that is.
FO300029774	Damn! You sound like you've been sampling your own stuff.
FO300029775	No, no, no! I would never do that.
FO300029776	Paulie does. Sample it, I mean. He's my deadbeat husband.
FO300029777	No, no, no! I would never do that.
FO300029778	Paulie did. Sample it, I mean. He's dead now, thank God.
FO300029779	Nice place you have here.
FO300029780	You must be drunk. Are you going to order or what?
FO300029781	Is this swill even safe to drink?
FO300029782	Probably not. What'll you have?
FO300029783	This place is real dump.
FO300029784	Yeah? Well it's my dump, not yours. Either order a drink or get out.
FO300029785	How dare you insult my taste in clothes.
FO300029786	I was merely trying to encourage you to shop at Potomac Attire.
FO300029787	I'm sure you would find something there to suit you.
FO300029788	I see you are also a person of refinement.
FO300029789	Between you and me, keeping out the riff raff is good for business.
FO300029790	So I'm not good enough to shop here?
FO300029791	That's not what I meant.
FO300029792	What I meant was that my goods are of the highest quality, which I assume is what you are looking for.
FO300029793	It's nice to see a family in business together.
FO300029794	Thank you. If you're hungry, stop by Gary's Galley.
FO300029795	Gary's my dad. The food's better than what you'll get in the Wasteland.
FO300029796	You're a polite young woman.
FO300029797	Dad and I have had a rough time, but we're getting by.
FO300029798	Since dad died, I'm on my own. It's better than living on the street.
FO300029799	You look a bit young to be running this place alone.
FO300029800	You're a sweet little thing. Do you charge by the hour?
FO300029801	What?! That's gross!
FO300029802	I'm not some whore. Get away from me before I call security.
FO300029803	Can you tell me anything about the Rockwells' marriage?
FO300029804	Now see here. That's not anything for you to be asking about. Our marriage is our business, and it's private.
FO300029805	Why can't people just understand that, and just leave us alone?
FO300029806	Anything you want to tell me about your marriage?
FO300029807	Our marriage? Goodness, what kind of a question is that?
FO300029808	Mabel didn't put you up to this, did she? What a silly thing to ask about.
FO300029809	Anything you want to tell me about your marriage?
FO300029810	Oh, but I suppose that's not really something you should concern yourself with. All in the past now.
FO300029811	Their marriage? Why that's an odd sort of question. They're like anyone else, I suppose. Got their problems, but they work through them.
FO300029812	Janet's a good woman. It's a good thing that Roger came to his senses.
FO300029813	Another of his games? I won't be a party to it. You leave those poor people be.
FO300029814	Now what's a kid like you want to know about that? Kind of grown-up stuff to be worried about, don't you think?
FO300029815	Well, don't you worry your head about it. They worked out their problems a while ago. Haven't heard them fight in a long time.
FO300029816	Well, they're just so nice, aren't they? It's good the two of them worked everything out.
FO300029817	Why are you asking me? I don't know anything. And why should I care about their marriage, anyway?
FO300029818	No, and enough with the third degree already!
FO300029819	This has to be the work of the Family! I've caught weirdo leader of theirs talking to Ian down by the river.
FO300029820	Nope, and it's unlikely they left him alive.
FO300029821	What am I gonna do? The Wests' lives were my responsibility and look what happened!
FO300029822	This has to be the work of the Family! I've caught weirdo leader of theirs talking to Ian down by the river.
FO300029823	No, I only found the parents' bodies.
FO300029824	This has to be the work of the Family! I've caught that weirdo leader of theirs talking to Ian down by the river.
FO300029825	Ever heard of the Family?
FO300029826	Yeah, supposed to be some kinda gang or something. Big deal. They wouldn't dare come around Paradise Falls.
FO300029827	RadioGNRDashwoodEp2
FO300029828	Quite right, old Chum. Save those questions, Miss Chase. If we survive what happens next, I may even answer them!
FO300029829	Boss, that sounds like a kid screaming! And it's coming from those ruins!
FO300029830	<sound of a child screaming>
FO300029831	Ahh, now, Argyle old chum. Let's not, um, bore the beautiful Miss Chase with those ancient exploits.
FO300029832	Are you kidding, my dear? Argyle has saved my skin more times than I care to remember. I hardly know how I got by before I met him.
FO300029833	My my, Argyle. You are rather resourceful for a Ghoul, aren't you?
FO300029834	Heh heh. The old "Shady Sands Shuffle." It sure brings me back. You two smoothskins okay?
FO300029835	<loud explosions>
FO300029836	It's not what he's taking out my dear, but rather what he's putting in. Duck and Covveerrr!
FO300029837	Why is your Ghoul friend picking their pockets? This is no time for sticky fingers, Daring!
FO300029838	Super Mutants!
FO300029839	Stupid human! Shut up now! <sound of guns cocking> You come with us now!
FO300029840	And by "disrupt" I mean "blow up."
FO300029841	My friends call me Penelope, and let's just say those Slavers don't take too kindly to people disrupting their caravans.
FO300029842	<sound of walking over gravel>
FO300029843	Ha! That'll teach those Slaver slimebags to follow us. Looks like that's the last of them, boss.
FO300029844	<sounds of gunfire>

FO300029853	Penelope Chase, fortune hunter. You can buy me a beer later. Now let's cut this shindig short and get the bloody hell out of here! Come on!
FO300029854	Wait a minute! We do the rescuing around here, sister.
FO300029855	You boys all right? I busted out of that box and was almost home free when I noticed your predicament.
FO300029856	Drop the steel, you Slaver scumbag. <sound of a hit>
FO300029857	Ha ha! Now, the door.
FO300029858	Huh?
FO300029859	Allow me. <walking> Hey fella, got a light?
FO300029860	<Sound of movement, huffing and puffing>
FO300029861	Sigh. Always with the dames.
FO300029862	Not so fast, my flesh-rotten friend! That girl we came in with. We're the only chance she's got. Come on!
FO300029863	Don't thank me yet, boss. We still need to get out of here. Let's go! While the guard's away from the front gate!
FO300029864	Argyle, you magnificent bastard! You did it!
FO300029865	Know anything else that could help me stop them?
FO300029866	My nephew Derek might know more about them. I swear, it's all I can do to keep him from running into the fight whenever they come out.
FO300029867	He might know more about where you can find them, but don't encourage the poor boy. He's had enough close calls!
FO300029868	If you could just get make either one of them stop fighting, it'd do the trick. You probably wouldn't have to worry about the other one.
FO300029869	I can't imagine Scott attacking the town with his robots, and that AntAgonizer girl was never much more than a sideshow freak by herself.
FO300029870	Roe may prefer that you're thorough, but all I care about is that you get the job done, one way or the other.
FO300029871	Know anything else that could help me stop them?
FO300029872	No way! Don't stop them! They're awesome!
FO300029873	Unless maybe you're going to be a super-hero, too!
FO300029874	You could be called "Super-Humongous" and fight them with an army of Super-Mutants!
FO300029875	No way! Don't stop them! They're awesome!
FO300029876	Unless maybe you're going to be a super-hero, too!
FO300029877	You could be called "Awesome-Claw" and fight them with an army of Deathclaws!
FO300029878	No way! Don't stop them! They're awesome!
FO300029879	Unless maybe you're going to be a super-hero, too!
FO300029880	You could be called "The Brilliant Shadow" and undermine all of their plots with an army of Mole Rats!
FO300029881	No way! Don't stop them! They're awesome!
FO300029882	Unless maybe you're going to be a super-hero, too!
FO300029883	No way! Don't stop them! They're awesome!
FO300029884	Unless maybe you're going to be a super-hero, too!
FO300029885	No way! Don't stop them! They're awesome!
FO300029886	Unless maybe you're going to be a super-hero, too!
FO300029887	Just don't fight them, okay?
FO300029888	What can you tell me about the AntAgonizer?
FO300029889	One day there was a crazy woman leading a bunch of ants into town. She said humanity was dead and the ants would inherit the Earth. Stuff like that.
FO300029890	Well, that gave Dom plenty of time to line up a shot or two on the ants. She ran away, but every once in a while, she'd stage an "attack" again.
FO300029891	She wasn't much of a threat, then. In fact, she was sort of entertaining, at first. Gave everyone in town something to talk about.
FO300029892	But when the Mechanist started fighting her, things got bad. Ants are easy to shoot, but add robots with lasers, and it got real nasty.
FO300029893	I don't know who she is, other than a crazy with an ant suit and a chip on her shoulder for humanity.
FO300029894	She wasn't much trouble by herself, really. Her attacks were a joke, but at least stories of her kept some of the raiders at bay.
FO300029895	If it helps, she was always attacking from the warrens up North. Maybe you can find her ant nest in there.
FO300029896	I don't know much about her, except she really, really doesn't like people. That's kinda cool. I mean, sometimes people are jerks.
FO300029897	I think her lair is somewhere in the caves to the north of the city. I've seen her ants down there once in a while.
FO300029898	Joe Porter said he found out something about her, but my uncle won't let him tell me. He says, "Don't encourage the poor boy."
FO300029899	What can you tell me about the Mechanist?
FO300029900	The Mechanist used to be our town mechanic. Scott Wollinksi, quiet guy, but plenty fierce with a wrench and some solder.
FO300029901	Guy used to take care of a robot that protected the town... until it got torn up in one of the AntAgonizer's lame little attacks.
FO300029902	I guess he took it personal, because he made a mechanical suit and called himself the Mechanist. Said he would lead a robot army to fight her.
FO300029903	Now he doesn't even respond to his name, and his "robot army" is more dangerous to the town than the ants ever were.
FO300029904	You mean Scott Wollinksi. I refuse to call him by that ridiculous name just because his head got a screw loose.
FO300029905	He used to be a damned good friend, and not just because he fixed my guns up.
FO300029906	Now he spends all his time up in that 'bot shop, just thinking about fighting that AntAgonizer. Hardly even recognizes his own name, anymore.
FO300029907	I knew the Mechanist back when he was just a normal-hero. He used to be called Scott, and he fixed up stuff around town!
FO300029908	But one day, the AntAgonizer killed his favorite robot, and I told him he ought to fight back against her like a real super-hero!
FO300029909	Ever since then, he's been up in his Forge in the back of the robot shop on the hill, working to protect us all from the AntAgonizer!
FO300029910	What is this place?
FO300029911	This place is my place of business. If you wanna buy something, then buy. If you wanna flap your lips, take a hike.
FO300029912	Well, Vance told me that this place was called Meresti. It was named after some town way across the ocean in a place called Romania.
FO300029913	This is Meresti, the home of the Family. It's the only safe place for these poor people.
FO300029914	It's the last place I ever expected to end up.
FO300029915	But don't tell Vance that I said that.
FO300029916	This lovely hole in the ground is Meresti, the headquarters of the Family.
FO300029917	You are standing inside Meresti, the home of the Family. This is our sanctuary from the outside world.
FO300029918	It is a refuge for those society labels as outcasts.
FO300029919	That's easy! The AntAgonizer's suit makes her super-agile, but I guess her ants are pretty weak on their own. Just watch out for her royal guard.
FO300029920	The Mechanist's robots are a lot tougher, and his suit makes him super-smart. I don't think he has any weaknesses.
FO300029921	Well, maybe one. Since he's a good guy, he's not as ruthless as the AntAgonizer. Like, he'd never hurt an innocent like me... if he could help it.
FO300029922	What are their super powers? Do they have any weaknesses?
FO300029923	I think I'll tough it out.
FO300029924	Your choice, but an addiction ain't an easy thing to kick.
FO300029925	Your choice, but an addiction ain't an easy thing to kick.
FO300029926	Your call, mungo.
FO300029927	Yes, cure me.
FO300029928	Well, this might go better for you if you hadn't blown your money on Jet, don't you think?
FO300029929	I don't have 50 caps.
FO300029930	Well, this might go better for you if you hadn't blown your money on Jet, don't you think?
FO300029931	I don't have 50 caps.
FO300029932	I suppose if you can't afford treatment, maybe you can't afford your next fix. So that works out, doesn't it?
FO300029933	I don't have 50 caps.
FO300029934	Okay, this should flush you out pretty quick. Now open your mouth and say "Ah."
FO300029935	I'll be glad to help when you can afford the treatment.
FO300029936	I don't have 20 caps.
FO300029937	I think I might be addicted to something.
FO300029938	I can give you something that'll should help.
FO300029939	The treatment costs 50 caps. Even most outsiders should be able to afford it.
FO300029940	I can take care of it for you, for a price.
FO300029941	That'll be 50 caps. Maybe the dent in your pocketbook will keep you away from that crap.
FO300029942	I swear, you and Zip, just full of your own little chemical problems, aren't you?
FO300029943	Here, hold on. I've got you covered.
FO300029944	I think I might be addicted to something. Can you help?
FO300029945	And here I thought Zip's soda problem was bad.
FO300029946	For 50 caps, I can help you get over that. Otherwise, you can find your own solution.
FO300029947	I think I might be addicted to something. Can you help?
FO300029948	I'm just glad you're willing to get help. But the treatment isn't free. I'll need 50 caps for the drugs.
FO300029949	I thought you had the look about you. Sure, I can help you. But it's not free. 50 caps, take it or leave it.
FO300029950	Could you repair my equipment?
FO300029951	I suppose that I can. The Brotherhood can make use of Wasteland currency to trade.
FO300029952	Certainly.
FO300029953	Do you think you could repair my equipment?
FO300029954	Oh, very well. But make haste!
FO300029955	Do you think you could repair my equipment?
FO300029956	Could I? Yes. Will I? No. Go see Peabody or Bowditch.
FO300029957	Do you think you could repair my equipment?
FO300029958	What do you do here?
FO300029959	I am charged with the duty of turning these maggots into Brothers of Steel.
FO300029960	With the threat of the Enclave, they're likely going to be pressed into service before they've taken the oath.
FO300029961	So, I've got a lot of work to do.
FO300029962	HireButch2B
FO300029963	Yeah, well what do you know? I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna have the biggest, toughest gang ever!
FO300029964	HireButch2A
FO300029965	What? A goody-two-shoes like you could never make it in a real gang!
FO300029966	You want to hang with a Tunnel Snake like me, you gotta be hard.
FO300029967	You could join forces with me, if you'd like.
FO300029968	Ride with me, and we can rampage across the Wasteland.
FO300029969	I really wish I could, man, but three's a crowd, you know? I'll just stay here for now.
FO300029970	Tunnel Snakes rule!
FO300029971	Come along with me, and we'll make an awesome gang.
FO300029972	Tunnel Snakes rule!
FO300029973	Come along with me, and we'll make an awesome gang.
FO300029974	Hell yeah, I do! I could be out there and kicking butt in my own gang and everything. The Tunnel Snakes could ride again!
FO300029975	Or, y'know, slither again. Whatever!
FO300029976	Still want to start that gang, Butch?
FO300029977	RadioGNRNewsRELAY
FO300029978	Why would I want your used up hand-me-down?
FO300029979	I don't think Clover's going to be used-up any time soon. That girl's got the devil in her. And she's crazy, to boot.
FO300029980	Crazy in a fight, crazy in the sack, crazy every which way but loose! But most of all, she's crazy in love with whoever's holding her leash.
FO300029981	And for the low cost of a thousand caps, Miss Clover could be crazy for you.
FO300029982	BuyClover3B
FO300029983	Then good luck finding someone who'd risk their life for yours. Not something a sane person would do these days, is it?
FO300029984	No deal. I like my bodyguards sane.
FO300029985	BuyClover3A
FO300029986	Any time you need some company, she'll be here.
FO300029987	I wish I could take her now. Maybe later.
FO300029988	I ought to sic Clover on you, just to show who's boss.
FO300029989	But you're right. She makes the other girls nervous. And when they're nervous, I'm nervous.
FO300029990	So go ahead and have fun with Clover. She's your problem, now!
FO300029991	If she's so crazy, maybe I'll take her off your hands. But only for 500 caps.
FO300029992	You don't know the half of it, friend.
FO300029993	Sounds like a good deal, and fun, too. Sold.
FO300029994	Trust me, she's worth every cap.
FO300029995	Guess I'll have to save up for her.
FO300029996	Good boy, Dogmeat!
FO300029997	<pant> <pant>
FO300029998	Good boy, Dogmeat!
FO300029999	Come with me, dog. It'll be good to have some company out here.
FO300030000	<bark> <bark> <bark!>
FO300030001	I guess your old master must have taken pretty good care of you.
FO300030002	<pant> <pant>
FO300030003	I could use a pet like you. Let's go find something to eat, mutt.
FO300030004	<growl!>
FO300030005	I can be your new master. Would you like that, boy?
FO300030006	<bark!> <bark!> <bark!>
FO300030007	What makes her so special?
FO300030008	I'll tell you why: because Clover is the craziest girl I've ever seen. And I'm an expert on crazy girls.
FO300030009	Crazy in a fight, crazy in the sack, crazy every which way but loose! But most of all, she's crazy in love with whoever's holding her leash.
FO300030010	And for the low cost of a thousand caps, Miss Clover could be crazy for you.
FO300030011	Have you seen this place? I've got all the guards a body would ever need. Even a body as fabulous as mine.
FO300030012	Isn't she your bodyguard? Why sell her?
FO300030013	BuyClover1
FO300030014	Gotta be careful, using a slave as a bodyguard. Most aren't exactly motivated to keep you alive, you know what I mean?
FO300030015	I'm in the market for a bodyguard like yours. You selling?
FO300030016	You were my rescuer and my only connection to this world, so I felt compelled to see you safe.
FO300030017	If this is what you think of me, perhaps I should not have bothered. But I know no-one else in this world.
FO300030018	What makes you think I wanted a monster like you following me?
FO300030019	I saw your capture, and a little cleverness allowed me to follow your captors. I only wish I could have arrived sooner to aid your escape!
FO300030020	As I owe you my freedom, I felt it was only fair that I return the favor. After all, I know no-one else in this world.
FO300030021	Fawkes? What the hell are you doing out here?
FO300030022	HireFawkes1B
FO300030023	My friend, I would be honored to follow a hero such as yourself. Shall we go?
FO300030024	I could always use a hand. Would you like to follow me?
FO300030025	RRFawkesGreeting2B
FO300030026	It seems I didn't know you as well as I had thought. My mistake.
FO300030027	I've read about a museum of history in the south. Perhaps I can learn more about the world there, without facing such enmity.
FO300030028	I will take my leave of you. Goodbye, my rescuer.
FO300030029	I was in that situation once, myself. Deal with it.
FO300030030	RRFawkesGreeting2A
FO300030031	I appreciate the offer, but I must decline. I have an entire world to explore, and I must not be delayed any further.
FO300030032	I have read about a great museum of history to the south. Perhaps I will head there.
FO300030033	Goodbye, my friend. Perhaps I will join you in the future, if your goals are virtuous enough to draw me away.
FO300030034	I could always use a hand. Would you like to follow me?
FO300030035	My friend, I would be honored to follow a hero such as yourself. Shall we go?
FO300030036	I could always use a hand. Would you like to follow me?
FO300030037	Imagine the evil that can be eliminated with such tools!
FO300030038	Looks like you've got a new toy, huh?
FO300030039	CG04DoorYell
FO300030040	Are you crazy? The Vault's in lockdown! Get back to your room.
FO300030041	I'm not opening this door until I get the all clear from the Overseer.
FO300030042	Sorry, but I intend to stay on the Overseer's good side.
FO300030043	Everybody's supposed to be in their rooms during the lockdown. What are you doing out in the hall?
FO300030044	Go away! I'm not opening the door until the lockdown's over.
FO300030045	Here, you can have it. Just move on and leave Canterbury alone.
FO300030046	For your loyal assistance, take this blade. Its sting carries the venom of a thousand ants, and your foes shall tremble before it!
FO300030047	Now that the tin-plated menace is no more, I shall take my leave of this town. I do believe it's time for my colony to spread.
FO300030048	Excellent. The evil taint of the AntAgonizer will never darken the land again! Now that the AntAgonizer is taken care of, Canterbury Commons is safe!
FO300030049	And for your loyal assistance, I'm honored to present you with this laser pistol, crafted from my last loyal robot assistant. May it guide you well!
FO300030050	But the Mechanist cannot rest! Not while there's evil afoot in the Wasteland! Farewell!
FO300030051	If you want the suit, you'll have to take it from me.
FO300030052	Very well. I never got a chance to take it from the Mechanist's corpse, so yours will have to do.
FO300030053	If violence is my only recourse, then violence it shall be.
FO300030054	Everything in there is dead.
FO300030055	I'm proud of you. Now let's get in there.
FO300030056	It's not safe in there yet.
FO300030057	All right. We'll stay here, then.
FO300030058	Do what you have to, but be careful.
FO300030059	Sorry, but I'm not doing that.
FO300030060	Please reconsider. Until we can get inside and turn the computers on, we can't get any closer to finishing our project.
FO300030061	I would hate to see all this effort go to waste.
FO300030062	Sure thing. I'll be right back.
FO300030063	Be careful.
FO300030064	I don't like this, but I'll do it.
FO300030065	Thank you.
FO300030066	No problem. I'll make sure it's safe.
FO300030067	Thank you. We'll wait here until you give the all-clear.
FO300030068	How could you ask me to do something like that?
FO300030069	I'm afraid I don't have many options. Please know that I would never put you in this position if I didn't think it was absolutely necessary.
FO300030070	Will you do it?
FO300030071	Are you kidding me?
FO300030072	I know, I know. Believe me, I'm not entirely comfortable with it either.
FO300030073	There are sentry guns in there that may still have power. If you can turn them on, they can do at least some of the work for you.
FO300030074	Is the museum looking to acquire anything else?
FO300030075	Well, yes. Any document of historical significance would be of benefit to the Society.
FO300030076	However, I am also interested in branching out. Perhaps some interesting artifacts related to our great country's history.
FO300030077	Be sure and bring me anything you find along those lines. I'd be happy to compensate you once again.
FO300030078	Any interest in partnering up again?
FO300030079	You know, I think I've had my fill of Wasteland roaming and picking through ruined buildings for a while.
FO300030080	Good news, Three Dog. I already have the dish.
FO300030081	Whoa! You must be some kind of a psychic or something!
FO300030082	Well, don't just stand there gawking... go bring that sucker to the Washington Monument so my lady can sing again!
FO300030083	Sorry, kiddo, but I'm not in the mood for jokes.
FO300030084	What? Oh, sweetie. Maybe you should just run along and play.
FO300030085	Sounds like you've been spending too much time with your nose in those darned comic books, sport.
FO300030086	This is what, some kind of computer simulation?
FO300030087	Computer what now? Why don't you go find Timmy and have a nice game of catch?
FO300030088	This is what, some kind of computer simulation?
FO300030089	Oh, you're such a kidder.
FO300030090	None of this is real. It's all some crazy experiment.
FO300030091	What? You're weird.
FO300030092	None of this is real. It's all some crazy experiment.
FO300030093	Sure, sport. Whatever you say! Ha, ha.
FO300030094	None of this is real. It's all some crazy experiment.
FO300030095	Is that so?
FO300030096	Well, you oughta tell that to my big toe, kiddo. Hurts like the dickens since I stubbed it earlier today. Feels pretty real to me!
FO300030097	What can you tell me about the neighborhood?
FO300030098	Well, there's certainly never a dull moment. I think it's like any other street, really.
FO300030099	Always something to see, and always something to talk about.
FO300030100	It's very nice. We're doing quite well.
FO300030101	You mean besides how wonderful it is to live here?
FO300030102	Everyone's very friendly. Even Old Lady Dithers, though she's lost most of her marbles.
FO300030103	Nice place. Real nice. Everyone's friendly, and always happy to lend a hand.
FO300030104	Nice day, isn't it?
FO300030105	I suppose. I hadn't really noticed.
FO300030106	You won't find a day like this anywhere else!
FO300030107	Another perfect Saturday afternoon. Make sure you enjoy it, sport!
FO300030108	Of course it is! It's America, isn't it?
FO300030109	Well of course it is. What a silly thing to say. What else would it be?
FO300030110	It sure is. But it always is here!
FO300030111	Yep, you've got that right. Heck of a day to get some work done outdoors.
FO300030112	Good doggie.
FO300030113	<bark!> <bark!>
FO300030114	Take a hike, mutt.
FO300030115	<growl!>
FO300030116	This isn't rocket science. I know exactly what you are.
FO300030117	You amaze me. Never have I met a human with the gift of cognition that you possess.
FO300030118	Tell me then, what are we?
FO300030119	Enough talk! I'm here to wipe your kind out!
FO300030120	I would choose your next words VERY carefully if I were in your place.
FO300030121	Your self-applauding notions are the sole reason we are down here in hiding like Mole Rats.
FO300030122	I will warn you only once. Do NOT test me. I have no qualms about having your blood running down my throat.
FO300030123	Your words hold no fear with me, human.
FO300030124	You just try it, psycho, and I'll splatter your brains all over that wall!
FO300030125	I'm not here to take sides, just to make sure Vance hasn't omitted any facts.
FO300030126	I'd never thought of it that way. I suppose he should get a chance to talk to someone like you.
FO300030127	Here's the password to his isolation area. Just please don't mention my name to Vance about this.
FO300030128	MS09MerestiVanceChatterReply
FO300030129	That is not how the Family operates, and you know it! Now do not test my patience on this subject.
FO300030130	Understandable. Give him time, Justin. Change is a very difficult thing to adapt to.
FO300030131	Implying that you wish to sleep with everyone here is not what I call boosting morale. Now, please. Keep it to one at a time.
FO300030132	You always have a knack for making me feel better.
FO300030133	No need to thank me, Alan. You have achieved this level of enlightenment all on your own, I was merely a guide.
FO300030134	I will make this as clear as possible, Karl. Never again. You disobey my laws once more and you will be out of Meresti for good!
FO300030135	How is our newest member? Is he finding his meditation time enlightening?
FO300030136	I wonder if the Family will really work. Sometimes with all the troubles we have, it seems impossible to hold it together.
FO300030137	I think you need to ease up with your flirting. It is becoming very distracting to the men as they adapt to things down here.
FO300030138	I just wanted to tell you I feel you have progressed quite well in adopting our laws. You should be proud.
FO300030139	Yeah, I've heard this song and dance before. What good is it if we can't really kick those humans where it hurts?
FO300030140	Yes, Vance. What is it?
FO300030141	Okay I guess. The new guy's taking up most of my time, but I think he'll come around. He's been through some serious shit.
FO300030142	Yes, my love?
FO300030143	Look, I'm going to give you a bit of friendly advice. Stop ignoring the rules and making Vance angry. He almost kicked you out of here.
FO300030144	Better I suppose. I think Vance is finally calming down after Karl apologized for all that trouble he caused.
FO300030145	Talk to me? W-what did I do?
FO300030146	Great, actually! I finished my first round of studies and Vance said that I was doing great. I think I'm finally beginning to get the hang of it!
FO300030147	Yeah, yeah. What is it now?
FO300030148	Crappy as usual. No one's been by here in ages to buy anything and Vance is crawlin' up my ass cause of that mess in Arefu.
FO300030149	Of course.
FO300030150	Oh, just dandy! I think the new guy is so darn cute. Never had someone so young before in this place.
FO300030151	Cool! I knew you'd get the hang of it. Good job, Alan!
FO300030152	Good, I'd hate to have Vance angry when he's inducting someone into the Family.
FO300030153	Well, you did kind of screw up. I mean, you didn't need to go and do all that stuff. He just wanted you to make them nervous.
FO300030154	Hey, with Vance teaching him personally he's bound to figure it all out soon enough. I wouldn't worry about it really.
FO300030155	Yeah, I guess. Hey, I really enjoyed last night by the way. Thanks for the company.
FO300030156	It's about time. Karl's gonna get us in trouble at this rate. I hope he learns to calm down a little bit.
FO300030157	It's your fault in the first place. You didn't have go wild like that.
FO300030158	Ha! I told you! In bed you were mumbling about how you think Vance is all disappointed with your progress. I knew he wasn't.
FO300030159	Yeah and I bet he was taking it out on you. Not getting any really for a while can drive you crazy.
FO300030160	Well, I just may have to do something special for Mr. Gloomy to cheer him up.
FO300030161	Oh, I like it when you talk dirty like that, old man. He he he.
FO300030162	Yep. We're both extremely proud of you. You've come such a long way in a short amount of time.
FO300030163	Yes, he is rather handsome. However, I think you may want to exercise a little bit of restraint. His situation is rather delicate.
FO300030164	That's good news. Vance and I are very worried about him. Thanks for taking him under your wing as well, Justin. We appreciate it.
FO300030165	Look, I'm going to give you a bit of friendly advice. Stop ignoring the rules and making Vance angry. He almost kicked you out of here.
FO300030166	Whoopee! Let's throw a party cause little Alan learned to stop acting like a goddamn animal! Hurray!
FO300030167	Cool your jets, sweet cheeks. You're jumpin' from bed to bed faster than a Radroach on a hotplate.
FO300030168	Stop wasting your time on that crybaby. You wanna make friends, go talk to Brianna. She'll take care of you.
FO300030169	What are you doing in Underworld?
FO300030170	My new line of work, actually.
FO300030171	I've used the proceeds from our last acquisition to set myself up as an ammunition vendor. Pretty cool, huh?
FO300030172	No more risking my neck to recover bits of junk for money. Now the cash comes right to me.
FO300030173	Care to take a look at my inventory?
FO300030174	Sure, take a look.
FO300030175	I'd like to buy some ammo from you.
FO300030176	Let me ask you about something else.
FO300030177	Okay! Shoot!
FO300030178	Addicted? Why would you say that? I can stop drinking it any time I want.
FO300030179	Is there anything else you're looking for?
FO300030180	Well, yes. Any document of historical significance would be of benefit to the Society.
FO300030181	However, I am also interested in branching out. Perhaps some interesting artifacts related to our great country's history.
FO300030182	Be sure and bring me anything you find along those lines. I'd be happy to compensate you once again.
FO300030183	Sure, sure. I'm working on it. Really.
FO300030184	Where did you say the Failsafe was?
FO300030185	The abandoned house. Keeps that one to himself, he does. That's where it is. That's why he doesn't want us in there.
FO300030186	There's nothing in that house. You're lying, or crazy, or both.
FO300030187	It's there, I tell you! He hides it, like he hides himself. You've got to find a way to draw it out. He knows how to do it, but he'd never tell you.
FO300030188	Did you look? Did you really look? You can't just look with your eyes, you know.
FO300030189	Look at Braun. You think he really looks like that little girl? He hides things. Confuses them. You have to find a way to find it.
FO300030190	Just leave me alone. I'm busy.
FO300030191	How come you're the only one who seems to know this?
FO300030192	You've got to find that failsafe!
FO300030193	Well, I guess it's time to find out. I'll go there myself.
FO300030194	The Brotherhood simply cannot spare the resources necessary to investigate the area. Perhaps you may be more successful.
FO300030195	If you do find anything, please return here so that we may decide on how best to proceed.
FO300030196	No thanks, I think I'll hold onto it.
FO300030197	How very disappointing!
FO300030198	Such a shame, I was hoping to add it to my collection.
FO300030199	Oh, very well. If you reconsider, you know where to find me.
FO300030200	I assure you no one else in the Wasteland will pay you more, but I respect your decision.
FO300030201	Sounds like a deal. Here you go.
FO300030202	You drive a hard bargain, but it's worth every cap.
FO300030203	Will you give me 100 caps for it?
FO300030204	Thank you very much!
FO300030205	Sounds like a deal. Here you go.
FO300030206	You drive a hard bargain, but it's worth every cap.
FO300030207	Will you give me 125 caps for it?
FO300030208	Thank you very much!
FO300030209	MS11SimmsMurderedSay
FO300030210	Gob!
FO300030211	Well, that's been a long time coming. Good riddance.
FO300030212	We don't have time for this! Trust me, security doesn't know about the tunnel. Just my father -- and me.
FO300030213	Maybe this pistol I stole from my father will make you feel better. Go ahead, take it, and then let's get out of here.
FO300030214	That sounds awfully complicated. Why can't I just get out the normal way?
FO300030215	My father's not stupid. He's sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from escaping.
FO300030216	The tunnel is the only way out! You're just going to have to trust me.
FO300030217	Oh, one more thing. I stole my father's pistol. I hope you won't need it, but you'd better take it just in case.
FO300030218	Sounds like a good plan. Let's get out of here!
FO300030219	Oh, one more thing. I stole my father's pistol. I hope you won't need it, but you'd better take it just in case.
FO300030220	I know how you feel. I lost my Dad.
FO300030221	<whimper>
FO300030222	Want to come with me? It's dangerous out here all alone.
FO300030223	<pant> <pant>
FO300030224	Don't worry, boy. You get used to losing people out here.
FO300030225	<whimper>
FO300030226	<bark!>
FO300030227	Hold still, boy. This Stimpak should have you feeling better soon.
FO300030228	<whimper>
FO300030229	Sorry, Dogmeat. I don't have any Stimpaks for you right now.
FO300030230	<whine> <whine>
FO300030231	Bad, Dogmeat! Very bad!
FO300030232	Mutts that don't shut up get eaten. See if I'm kidding.
FO300030233	<growl>
FO300030234	Been a while since I tasted dog meat. Now, play dead. Forever.
FO300030235	<growl!>
FO300030236	Looks like you've got some fight left in you, yet. That's a good sign.
FO300030237	<bark!>
FO300030238	What's the matter, boy? Lose your master?
FO300030239	<bark> <bark!>
FO300030240	You know, I think you're the first dog I've met that didn't try to eat me.
FO300030241	<bark> <bark!>
FO300030242	Shut up, mutt.
FO300030243	<bark> <bark!>
FO300030244	You're pretty friendly, aren't you, boy?
FO300030245	<bark!> <bark!>
FO300030246	Good teeth, strong claws. You're a fighting dog, aren't you?
FO300030247	<bark> <bark!>
FO300030248	Dukov has a special key. Get it for me and I'll take you to Rivet City.
FO300030249	FFsuperDuperMartTOPIC
FO300030250	Stay here, boy. Don't move until I come back!
FO300030251	<whine>
FO300030252	In that case, just die.
FO300030253	<growl!>
FO300030254	Okay, I'll leave. You stay here.
FO300030255	<whimper>
FO300030256	Fine, be that way.
FO300030257	<bark!> <bark!>
FO300030258	Shoo, dog. Get out of here.
FO300030259	<aroo?>
FO300030260	Holotapes? Did you listen to them? Your father was obsessive about taking notes. One of them might have something useful.
FO300030261	I've been to Project Purity. He wasn't there.
FO300030262	Well I know he was going there. Perhaps there's some indication of what he was up to. Did you find any notes?
FO300030263	James was always taking notes. Recordings, holotapes... that sort of thing. Go back and search for something like that if you're so determined.
FO300030264	CherryThanks
FO300030265	Well, you kept your promise. I really didn't think you would. Thank you.
FO300030266	Follow me.
FO300030267	The sooner we get there, the better.
FO300030268	Wait here.
FO300030269	Don't be gone too long.
FO300030270	We need to get more.
FO300030271	I know. But we got two here still.
FO300030272	The female is locked up. We'll take her back with us.
FO300030273	The tiny male is downstairs. He won't be coming with us, will he? Ahahahah!
FO300030274	Nope. Hahah!
FO300030275	We almost got all of those little people from Big Town. What then?
FO300030276	Find more. Somewhere else. Graaaah!
FO300030277	Yeah. Those bleeders are everywhere. We'll get them all and take them home.
FO300030278	Home. We need more prisoners before we can go home.
FO300030279	We'll go back and get more. Soon.
FO300030280	Greaaahhhh!!!!
FO300030281	Ahahahaha!
FO300030282	Never mind.
FO300030283	<aroo?>
FO300030284	Find me a weapon, boy!
FO300030285	<bark!>
FO300030286	Find chems, boy!
FO300030287	<bark!>
FO300030288	Find some food, boy!
FO300030289	<bark!>
FO300030290	Find some food, boy!
FO300030291	Find ammo, boy!
FO300030292	<bark!>
FO300030293	Dogmeat, I need you to find something for me.
FO300030294	<bark>
FO300030295	Stop searching, Dogmeat.
FO300030296	<bark>
FO300030297	I don't have 100 caps.
FO300030298	All right kid. Then I guess there's nothing else we have to say to each other. Come back to me when you have the caps, and we'll talk.
FO300030299	I don't know. Maybe Moriarty's right and you're just a junkie.
FO300030300	Who the hell are you to judge me? Tell Moriarty he can take his fucking caps and shove them up his ass!
FO300030301	Look, just give me some of your caps, and I'll tell him you're gone.
FO300030302	You'd do that for me? I never expected anyone to care enough.
FO300030303	Here you go. Thanks, kid. You're all right.
FO300030304	Look, just give me the caps and I'll tell him you're gone.
FO300030305	I am tired of hiding out here like some kind of Wasteland dog.
FO300030306	I don't care. I'm just here for caps.
FO300030307	Is there something wrong with your hearing? I just told you the caps are mine! You can't have them!
FO300030308	This is never gonna end until I send him a message. Well, fine. If I have to kill you to send it, I will!
FO300030309	You can talk all you want, but I'm not leaving without the caps.
FO300030310	Slow down. Tell me your side of the story.
FO300030311	Well, I got sick and tired of it. I told Moriarty I'm taking my share of the caps and leaving. I even slept with the pig to seal the deal.
FO300030312	Next morning he tells me I couldn't leave. So I bolted. I took my money and ran.
FO300030313	Now he's branded me a thief and a junkie and sent his cronies to find me. I guess I need a new hiding place.
FO300030314	You'd better calm down, before I put you down.
FO300030315	That lying bastard. Roped you into finding me too, huh?
FO300030316	Well, you're not getting a damn thing from me! You hear me?! Not a damn thing!
FO300030317	That sack of shit is convinced that I'm some crazy junkie who stole money from him!
FO300030318	Who's Moriarty?
FO300030319	That sack of shit is convinced that I'm some crazy junkie who stole money from him!
FO300030320	I don't deal with junkies. Hand over all your caps. Now!
FO300030321	You're not getting a damn thing from me! You hear me?! Not a damn thing!
FO300030322	Just hand over the caps, and I'll be out of your way.
FO300030323	Owe HIM some caps? He's a liar! He just wants you to kill me! Those caps are mine, fair and square.
FO300030324	Yes, and he says you owe him some caps.
FO300030325	Look, I need a way to get some caps or I'll never have the money to pay you.
FO300030326	If you're looking for a handout, you can forget it. But if you're looking for work, there's a favor you could do for me.
FO300030327	If your successful, it'll provide the caps you need to pay me.
FO300030328	Good. I hope she got what she deserved.
FO300030329	I took care of Silver for you.
FO300030330	No way, Moriarty. No favors.
FO300030331	Fine. Go find Daddy yourself then. I'll be here when you change your mind.
FO300030332	So, you want me to do your dirty work?
FO300030333	Who said anything about dirty work? You need some caps, I'm giving you a way to get 'em. It's just business.
FO300030334	Problem is she scrammed with the loot and set herself up in Springvale so she can inject herself into a stupor.
FO300030335	Get the caps she owes me and they're yours. Yours to pay me with anyway. He he he he he.
FO300030336	Sure, anything to get the information.
FO300030337	Problem is she scrammed with the loot and set herself up in Springvale so she can inject herself into a stupor.
FO300030338	Get the caps she owes me and they're yours. Yours to pay me with anyway. He he he he he.
FO300030339	No, sorry. I've left that part of my life behind.
FO300030340	What will you do now?
FO300030341	Who knows. Shoot myself up until I forget who I am?
FO300030342	The Wasteland sucks, kid. Just get used to it.
FO300030343	I haven't gone and looked them over, no.
FO300030344	Well you should! Go on out, take a gander, and see if there's anything that might meet your needs.
FO300030345	I will point out that there are a few kids out there. Not something you see very often; a very good long-term investment.
FO300030346	We can discuss details once you've had a chance to look things over.
FO300030347	Attention everyone! It is time to cut the cake!
FO300030348	Andy! Wait!
FO300030349	Gear up, soldier!
FO300030350	Let 'em eat lead!
FO300030351	Time to kick some ass!
FO300030352	Mister Crowley wants that key. Now.
FO300030353	What key? Oh, that key.
FO300030354	You're a moron. I don't have any of his precious keys. Idiot.
FO300030355	Where can I get a stiff drink?
FO300030356	The Muddy Rudder. Belle waters down the liquor, but it's cheap. It's on the lower deck.
FO300030357	Try the Muddy Rudder. They don't ask too many questions down on the lower deck.
FO300030358	Is there anywhere I can get a drink on this tub?
FO300030359	The Weatherly Hotel is a good choice. It's on the upper deck.
FO300030360	Do you know where I can get something to drink?
FO300030361	The Weatherly Hotel is a good choice. It's on the upper deck.
FO300030362	Can I get a drink around here? Preferably somewhere clean.
FO300030363	FFSMCaptiveYellForHelp
FO300030364	I'm over here! Help!
FO300030365	<sobs>
FO300030366	<sobs>
FO300030367	Someone help me!
FO300030368	Please! Someone!
FO300030369	<whimpers>
FO300030370	Help me!
FO300030371	Help!
FO300030372	No, you'll need it more than I will.
FO300030373	You're right. It's dangerous out here.
FO300030374	I'll take that. Now get out of here.
FO300030375	You're right. I'll try to make it on my own. If I'm careful, I should be okay.
FO300030376	I can't believe what I've discovered. Just before he died, one of the security team members told me everything.
FO300030377	The Overseer has been implanting these murderous intentions in the entire Vault population without my knowledge!
FO300030378	Using the loudspeakers in the dorms instead of just the studios, he subjected everyone to the white noise as they slept.
FO300030379	I'm going to have to confront him now and make him pay for what he's done. Half the Vault is dead, the other half fighting for its life.
FO300030380	Good luck to all of us and may God have mercy on our souls.
FO300030381	The situation is getting out of hand. Over half the population of the Vault is exhibiting savage tendencies.
FO300030382	In essence, I feel that they are almost psychologically devolving. I was stupid for rushing these experiments, and now over 35 people are dead.
FO300030383	Unbelievable! We've had twelve more incidents in the past month mirroring Subject V920717's actions.
FO300030384	The shocking part is the savagery these aberrants exhibit when they murder. They rip their victims apart limb from limb and eviscerate them by hand.
FO300030385	These used to be respected members of the musical community. How could this be happening? Where have I gone wrong?
FO300030386	Disaster today. One of our test subjects, V920717, has murdered three other residents in a fit of unbridled rage the likes of which I've never seen.
FO300030387	It took almost 23 shots before the security team took him down. This subject has no history of violence or mental instability whatsoever.
FO300030388	My concern is that this subject is one of our most successful implant recipients, able to execute complex instructions during trance-state.
FO300030389	I'm a bit encouraged by the latest batch of data. It seems that 33 percent of the subjects are now lapsing into a trance-like state on occasion.
FO300030390	When in this state, we're fairly certain that suggestion and programming of the subject can be applied.
FO300030391	We've begun testing this by implanting subtle cues in affected subjects, making them scratch their ear or constantly fix their hair.
FO300030392	So far I'm happy to report a 100% success rate on this implantation method.
FO300030393	So far, the experiment is going exactly as planned.
FO300030394	We're subjecting the residents to extremely low frequency white noise in regular intervals through the loudspeaker system.
FO300030395	Using the soundproof recording studios and the musicians was an inspired idea. Kudos to the Vault-Tec selection committee on their shrewdness.
FO300030396	100 caps!? Are you nuts? I don't have that kind of money!
FO300030397	Guilty as charged.
FO300030398	If you don't have the caps to pay for the information, then maybe you could do a little favor for me.
FO300030399	You're a liar, Moriarty. I know where I grew up.
FO300030400	"All hail the Overseer! We're born in the Vault, we die in the Vault!" And all that other assorted lunacy.
FO300030401	You're wrong. My Dad never would have lied to me.
FO300030402	'All hail the Overseer! We're born in the Vault; we die in the Vault!' And all that other assorted lunacy.
FO300030403	Oh, I wasn't born in the Vault? That's complete bullshit, and you know it.
FO300030404	'All hail the Overseer! We're born in the Vault; we die in the Vault!' And all that other assorted lunacy.
FO300030405	'All hail the Overseer! We're born in the Vault; we die in the Vault!' And all that other assorted lunacy.
FO300030406	Stay here. Maybe I'll come back for you.
FO300030407	<whine>
FO300030408	Where can I find Joseph?
FO300030409	I'm the Mayor, not a babysitter, mungo. Beats me.
FO300030410	Maybe he's back there by the door. Fuck if I know.
FO300030411	I fail to see how such a device would be useful to you. In fact, I doubt such a thing really works.
FO300030412	Either way, the Brotherhood is not in possession of such a device.
FO300030413	If you are determined to waste your time, you may go off in search of one.
FO300030414	You mentioned something about Galaxy News Radio?
FO300030415	There aren't a lot of safe places in the ruins right now, but the Galaxy News Radio building is sort of our port in the storm.
FO300030416	Unfortunately, the building's been hit pretty hard lately. We're their backup. So if there are no more questions, we really need to move out.
FO300030417	Well, the Brotherhood needed a secure outpost, and the guy who runs the radio station needed to not get his head ripped off by Super Mutants.
FO300030418	It's a mutually beneficial relationship.
FO300030419	Anything else you can tell me about GNR?
FO300030420	Who did you say you were again?
FO300030421	The name's Sarah Lyons, Sentinel and squad commander of the Lyons' Pride. We're with the Brotherhood of Steel.
FO300030422	We do our best to hold back the Super Mutants in this area. But when civilians stumble into our sights, that gets a bit difficult. Doesn't it?
FO300030423	I'll take that as a compliment.
FO300030424	If we don't try to keep the mutants from killing everyone and everything in the Capital Wasteland, who will?
FO300030425	Wow. You guys don't screw around.
FO300030426	Ha! It's not like he'd tell you anyway.
FO300030427	It's Irving.
FO300030428	Hahahaha! Irving! Are you serious?
FO300030429	Here's the pool. You earned it!
FO300030430	You never did tell me what I'd win.
FO300030431	Ha! Good point. The pool is up to about 1,000 caps these days.
FO300030432	Now, c'mon! C'mon! What's his name?
FO300030433	Never mind.
FO300030434	Yeah. Never mind.
FO300030435	Can't we work something out? Maybe share the winnings?
FO300030436	No. We can't.
FO300030437	Come on, it will really throw those guys for a loop if you tell me.
FO300030438	Fine. I'm tired of this game. Irving. My name is Irving. There. Go collect your money.
FO300030439	Maybe now they'll leave me alone about it.
FO300030440	Fine. I'm tired of this game. Irving. My name is Irving. There. Go collect your money.
FO300030441	Maybe now they'll leave me alone about it.
FO300030442	Are you sure you won't tell me?
FO300030443	Sorry, pal. Vance is worm food.
FO300030444	You son-of-a-bitch! You KILLED him and you think it's funny?!
FO300030445	He was my only chance to understand what the hell is wrong with me! And you messed it all up!
FO300030446	Well you can just GO TO HELL!
FO300030447	Well, Vance isn't going to be able to help anymore.
FO300030448	Wait. What do you mean? He's dead... you killed him?
FO300030449	But he was my only chance to understand what the hell is happening to me!
FO300030450	Vance is dead, Ian. I'm so sorry.
FO300030451	No time to discuss it. We're getting the heck out of here!
FO300030452	I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here.
FO300030453	I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you're here. I figured Evan King would get someone to track me down sooner or later.
FO300030454	You're tough to find.
FO300030455	Maybe that's because I don't want to be found.
FO300030456	I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you're here. I figured Evan King would get someone to track me down sooner or later.
FO300030457	Evan King sent me to look for you.
FO300030458	Yeah, I guess I should have known this would happen.
FO300030459	Never mind.
FO300030460	Nothing I can say will change your mind will it?
FO300030461	Unless you can prove to me there's a good reason to leave, I'm staying right here in Meresti. Even alone if I have to.
FO300030462	I changed my mind, Ian. I think you should stay here.
FO300030463	Thank you, somehow just hearing you say that helps me a lot.
FO300030464	Look, all I ever wanted was someone to let me make decisions for myself. For once I've decided that this is where I should be.
FO300030465	I've done something terrible and I need to deal with it. Until I'm ready to face it, I'm staying here in Meresti. Even if I have to stay alone.
FO300030466	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet that would change your mind.
FO300030467	I think I had it all wrong. I shouldn't have come here. I bet Lucy is feeling just as bad as me.
FO300030468	I think I had it all wrong. I shouldn't have come here. I bet Lucy is feeling just as bad as me.
FO300030469	Please, tell Vance I've made my decision. I'm going home to Arefu. I hope to see you there as well.
FO300030470	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet that would change your mind.
FO300030471	I think I had it all wrong. I shouldn't have come here. I bet Lucy is feeling just as bad as me.
FO300030472	Do what you want. This is a waste of time.
FO300030473	Yeah, that's just what I thought you'd end up saying.
FO300030474	Get outta here, you murderer. You killed everyone left that I cared about!
FO300030475	If you want to stay, then stay. You have to do what you feel is right.
FO300030476	I can never go home. This was always meant to be my home and until something tells me otherwise, this is where I wanna be.
FO300030477	Even if I stay alone. Tell Evan King that I'm sorry.
FO300030478	Look, this place isn't the answer. You need to go home and face your demons.
FO300030479	Maybe you're right. It was easier to run away with the Family than to face what I did.
FO300030480	I delivered the letter to Ian.
FO300030481	Oh, thank you for remembering! With everything that's going on, I almost forgot about it.
FO300030482	You have no idea how much this means to me. Thanks so much!
FO300030483	You have no idea how much this means to me. Thanks so much!
FO300030484	I have a letter for you from your sister, Lucy.
FO300030485	No, I lied. I'm their newest member!
FO300030486	What the fuck? You liar!
FO300030487	Look, maybe you better explain what's going on first.
FO300030488	At first they just showed up and carried on like a bunch of kids down there by the riverbed, scaring the Brahmin and stuff like that.
FO300030489	But this last time, they went too far. They charged up the ramp and started banging on our doors trying to get us to open up.
FO300030490	I was hoping to find out what the Family did here.
FO300030491	At first they just showed up and carried on like a bunch of kids down there by the riverbed, scaring the Brahmin and stuff like that.
FO300030492	But this last time, they went too far. They charged up the ramp and started banging on our doors trying to get us to open up.
FO300030493	Let me guess, you thought I was from the Family.
FO300030494	That's right! Go away!
FO300030495	Never mind.
FO300030496	SuperTalk2
FO300030497	Shut up, you stupid! Leave me alone! All you do is complain!
FO300030498	I don't know! What do I look like, a human? Talk, talk, talk! That's all you ever do!
FO300030499	Huh? What are you, some kind of human? Why you care? Shut up and go away!
FO300030500	Ha! You talk a lot! Sound funny when you talk, like a stupid human. Ha ha ha ha ha!
FO300030501	SuperTalk1
FO300030502	Wish I had a new weapon. Something good to smash with. Wish I could hold one of those Behemoth clubs. So big! So much crush!
FO300030503	I have joke for you. Ready? Knock knock.
FO300030504	You'll live, tough girl.
FO300030505	You jerk.
FO300030506	Nice. I'm dying and you're making jokes.
FO300030507	I'll be on my way, then.
FO300030508	Yes, yes. Best that you go now, before anything happens to you.
FO300030509	I'm afraid that's not possible. Not until you've taken the vial.
FO300030510	FFOutcastsTechInfo
FO300030511	Power armor, energy weapons, and all sorts of advanced technology. Even some junk like sensor units or spare parts can be useful.
FO300030512	Some of it goes into the archives, some of it gets used to repair our own gear. Either way, it's better in our hands than lying around out there.
FO300030513	What are you looking for, again?
FO300030514	FFOutcastsTrust
FO300030515	You've definitely proven your worth. I'll make sure to tell our people on patrol that you're a friend of the Outcasts.
FO300030516	So, are we good? You trust me enough now?
FO300030517	Okay, then.
FO300030518	That's all for now.
FO300030519	FFOutcastsRewardRadAway
FO300030520	Useful stuff out there. Hope you don't have to use too much.
FO300030521	I'll take Rad-Away.
FO300030522	Can't stand this stuff, myself. Goes through me like a rampaging Brahmin.
FO300030523	I'll take Rad-Away.
FO300030524	FFOutcastsRewardStimpaks
FO300030525	Here. Everyone's favorite. What would we do without them?
FO300030526	I'll take Stimpaks.
FO300030527	Here, enjoy them in good health. Or, at least, when you'd like to be in good health.
FO300030528	I'll take Stimpaks.
FO300030529	FFOutcastsRewardAmmo2
FO300030530	Be careful. These can pack quite a pop.
FO300030531	I'll take frag grenades.
FO300030532	Always a popular choice, these. Enjoy.
FO300030533	I'll take frag grenades.
FO300030534	FFOutcastsRewardAmmo1
FO300030535	Here you go. Try not to use it all in one place, unless you have to.
FO300030536	I'll take .556 ammo.
FO300030537	Here's hoping you don't have to use it. But who am I kidding?
FO300030538	I'll take .556 ammo.
FO300030539	FFOutcastsTechSpareParts
FO300030540	It's practically junk, but we can get some use out of it.
FO300030541	How'd you like your payment?
FO300030542	I've got some spare parts for you.
FO300030543	FFOutcastsTechSensorUnit
FO300030544	It's practically junk, but we can get some use out of it.
FO300030545	How'd you like your payment?
FO300030546	I've got a sensor unit for you.
FO300030547	FFOutcastsTechAlienCell
FO300030548	Interesting. Very interesting.
FO300030549	This definitely bears some study. Now, how would you like your payment?
FO300030550	Here, I found an Alien Power Cell.
FO300030551	FFOutcastsTechAlienBlaster
FO300030552	What in the world?
FO300030553	Yes, I think the boys down in the lab would be very interested in this. You did right to bring this to us!
FO300030554	Now, what would you like in return for this amazing find?
FO300030555	You'll like this. It's an Alien Blaster. Seriously.
FO300030556	FFOutcastsTechPlasmaPistol
FO300030557	Pretty rare piece of equipment, this. Good find.
FO300030558	How'd you like your payment?
FO300030559	I've got a Plasma Pistol for you.
FO300030560	FFOutcastsTechPlasmaRifle
FO300030561	Pretty rare piece of equipment, this. Good find.
FO300030562	How'd you like your payment?
FO300030563	I've got a Plasma Rifle for you.
FO300030564	FFOutcastsTechLaserPistol
FO300030565	We can always use another one of these.
FO300030566	How'd you like your payment?
FO300030567	How about a Laser Pistol?
FO300030568	FFOutcastsTechLaserRifle
FO300030569	We can always use another one of these.
FO300030570	How'd you like your payment?
FO300030571	How about a Laser Rifle?
FO300030572	This is some pretty heavy-duty stuff. We'll take good care of it.
FO300030573	Now, what can I give you in return?
FO300030574	Here's a Power Armor Helmet from the Enclave.
FO300030575	Well I'll be damned. The Advanced Power Armor Mark II. This is superb. Absolutely superb.
FO300030576	Now, what can I give you in return?
FO300030577	Here's some Power Armor from the Enclave.
FO300030578	You'd better believe it. I haven't seen a suit like this in a long time.
FO300030579	And what would you like for this little surprise?
FO300030580	This Tesla Armor might be of interest to you.
FO300030581	FFOutcastsPowerArmorHelmet
FO300030582	Not much good on its own, but the optics are useful, at least.
FO300030583	How'd you like your payment?
FO300030584	Take this Power Armor Helmet.
FO300030585	FFOutcastsTech
FO300030586	Always good to have another of these in the vaults.
FO300030587	How'd you like your payment?
FO300030588	Take this suit of Power Armor.
FO300030589	FFOutcastsTech1
FO300030590	I see you've got some of our Power Armor there. I'll just take that off your hands.
FO300030591	I'm sure you just found it in the Wastes and you're returning it to us, right? Because you'd have to be a real moron to try to turn it in for pay.
FO300030592	Now, let's see what else you've got.
FO300030593	I've got some technology to turn in.
FO300030594	Let's see what you've got.
FO300030595	I've got some technology to turn in.
FO300030596	FFOutcastWork2C
FO300030597	Suit yourself. Why don't you go talk with Lyons? He's always got time for your kind.
FO300030598	I'll pass. If I can't be a member, I won't be your errand boy.
FO300030599	Take all the time you need. But don't waste my time until you're ready to take the job.
FO300030600	I need time to consider it.
FO300030601	FFOutcastWork2B
FO300030602	Okay, but first you'll have to talk with Protector Casdin. You can work out the details with him.
FO300030603	Sounds good. I'm in.
FO300030604	That's what I like to hear! You can start immediately.
FO300030605	You'll report directly to me: I'll take in your gear and dole out your pay. Now get cracking!
FO300030606	I'll take the job.
FO300030607	FFOutcastWork2A
FO300030608	We may be the best-equipped people in the world, but we've still only got so many people out there looking to recover the past's technology.
FO300030609	Locals like you can cover more of the Wastes to uncover technological relics like Power Armor or power cells.
FO300030610	We know their value better than any junk-trader, and we've got more ammo stores, so you can expect a better trade for the tech.
FO300030611	I'm not sure. Tell me more about this work.
FO300030612	It's simple enough. Bring in technological devices, and we'll pay you for what you find.
FO300030613	Big things like power armor or energy weapons are best, but we'll take things like sensor units or spare parts, too. You never know what's important.
FO300030614	In return, we'll pay you with your choice of .556 ammo, grenades, stimpaks, or Rad-Away. I'll bet they're more useful to you out there, anyway.
FO300030615	I need to know more about the job before deciding.
FO300030616	Why do you want the suit?
FO300030617	Isn't it only fitting to gloat over the corpse of one's fallen foe? To revel in a victory over a larger and stronger opponent overcome?
FO300030618	If I couldn't be there to personally strip the facade from the iron interloper, the least I am owed is a chance to gloat over his shell.
FO300030619	I can hardly leave it lying around for someone else to find, now can I? The threat of the AntAgonizer must be put to an end forever!
FO300030620	I must not let her threaten all that humanity holds dear. Even now, twisted souls may seek to continue her legacy!
FO300030621	But not everyone agrees?
FO300030622	No, not everyone. But for a variety of reasons, those who disagree are no longer with us.
FO300030623	Well, I'm asking you. Why are you here?
FO300030624	I'm here for two reasons. One, Lyons needs me. He always has, just as much as I need him. We've been through a lot together, he and I.
FO300030625	It must be difficult to communicate with the West Coast.
FO300030626	Indeed it is. Especially when they refuse any attempts at communication.
FO300030627	Why, what happened?
FO300030628	Lines of communication were severed years ago. The Western Elders have washed their hands of us.
FO300030629	You make saving people sound like a bad thing.
FO300030630	It wasn't why we were sent here. Good or bad has nothing to do with it.
FO300030631	Lyons knew that, but ignored it. He decided it was more important to save the people here than to obey orders from his superiors.
FO300030632	For years he'd try and persuade them to send reinforcements and supplies, all the while stringing them along, saying he was sticking to the mission.
FO300030633	Finally, things came to a head. Lyons directly refused orders, and so the West Coast cut us off. No communications, no reinforcements.
FO300030634	He's in charge, so it's his decision, right?
FO300030635	He's in charge of this detachment, yes. He's not in charge of the Brotherhood.
FO300030636	As loyal as I am to the man, I can't overlook the fact that he disobeyed orders, and it cost us.
FO300030637	The West Coast cut us off completely, once they saw what was going on. So now we're on our own. No communications, no reinforcements.
FO300030638	Those sound like pretty good changes to me.
FO300030639	You're an outsider. I don't expect you to understand.
FO300030640	It's not something that's done. I appreciate that Lyons believes he is doing what is right, but he should never have disobeyed orders.
FO300030641	And now look where it's gotten us. Forces dwindled, Super Mutants on one side, Enclave on the other. We can barely take care of ourselves.
FO300030642	Sorry to have brought it up.
FO300030643	You are an outsider. You had no way of knowing.
FO300030644	What do you mean by "repercussions"?
FO300030645	Some did not approve of the Elder's decisions. Initially, they followed because we are all taught to follow the Elders.
FO300030646	What kind of changes?
FO300030647	We were dispatched with a specific mission. We were sent to locate and secure any technology remaining from before the war.
FO300030648	Like our robotic monstrosity. That was our greatest find. Damn thing still doesn't work, but at least it's ours.
FO300030649	He decided they were a threat. Not just to us, but to everyone. And so he altered the mission.
FO300030650	Finding the source of the mutants and putting a stop to them was his goal. Our original mission became an afterthought. We've failed both.
FO300030651	Then where's the rest of the Brotherhood?
FO300030652	The West Coast, unless something has changed.
FO300030653	There's been no contact with them for the last several years.
FO300030654	There's also a small detachment in Chicago, but they're off the radar. Gone rogue. Long story.
FO300030655	Why is that a sore subject?
FO300030656	Much has happened in the 23 years since we left the west coast. Our mission has changed in that time.
FO300030657	The changes have not all been pleasant, and have had significant repercussions.
FO300030658	I'd like to hear what you have to say anyway.
FO300030659	If you insist. What do you want to know?
FO300030660	Sorry. Never mind.
FO300030661	No need to apologize.
FO300030662	Why are you the wrong person to ask?
FO300030663	Predominantly because the Elder won't like some of what I have to say.
FO300030664	But fine, I'll discuss it. What do you want to know?
FO300030665	That's all I wanted to know.
FO300030666	So be it.
FO300030667	Was there something else, then?
FO300030668	How long have you been here?
FO300030669	It's been over twenty years since we arrived. And we've been struggling to contain and eradicate the Super Mutants for nearly as long.
FO300030670	With the arrival of the Enclave, I have a terrible feeling the Super Mutants are the least of our worries.
FO300030671	We arrived here in '55. Established ourselves in the Citadel within the first few months. The Elder has kept us busy since then.
FO300030672	If you're just a part of the Brotherhood, where's the rest of it?
FO300030673	The Brotherhood began on the West Coast, and exists there still. We were dispatched to this location many years ago.
FO300030674	In truth, the Brotherhood of Steel has been struggling for years, both here and back home.
FO300030675	But that's a bit of a sore subject around here.
FO300030676	You seem to have a pretty small organization.
FO300030677	Why are you here in the Capital Wasteland?
FO300030678	Ah, now that's the real question, isn't it?
FO300030679	Our orders were, and are, to acquire any and all advanced technology. And we have, to the best of our abilities.
FO300030680	But when I realized the extent of the Super Mutant threat, I felt it was my responsibility to aid the people in their struggle against them.
FO300030681	Unfortunately, my superiors back west disagree with my assessment of the situation. They feel I've grown too "attached" to the local populace.
FO300030682	And they're right.
FO300030683	Well, that all depends on who you ask.
FO300030684	Lyons will tell you it's because we're protecting the poor, innocent people of the Capital Wasteland.
FO300030685	Most others here will tell you the same thing. They'll do anything for that man.
FO300030686	I'd like to know more about the Brotherhood of Steel.
FO300030687	The Brotherhood is an old organization, going back to the years just after the war. We are but a part of it. What would you like to know?
FO300030688	What more did you want to know?
FO300030689	I'm afraid you're asking the wrong person.
FO300030690	What do you want to know?
FO300030691	Hold on Jonas, I need to record this first.
FO300030692	I don't really know how to tell you this. I hope you'll understand, but I know you might be angry.
FO300030693	I thought about it for a long time, but in the end I decided it was best for you not to know.
FO300030694	So many things could have gone wrong, and there's really no telling how the Overseer will react when he finds out.
FO300030695	It's best if he can blame everything on me.
FO300030696	Obviously, you already know that I'm gone. It was something I needed to do. You're an adult now. You're ready to be on your own.
FO300030697	Maybe some day, things will change and we can see each other again. I can't tell you why I left or where I'm going. I don't want you to follow me.
FO300030698	God knows life in the Vault isn't perfect, but at least you'll be safe. Just knowing that will be enough to keep me going.
FO300030699	Don't mean to rush you, Doc, but I'd feel better if we got this over with.
FO300030700	Okay. Go ahead.
FO300030701	Goodbye. I love you.
FO300030702	Don't mean to rush you, Doc, but I'd feel better if we got this over with.
FO300030703	She died well.
FO300030704	In the end, that's all that really matters.
FO300030705	Like I needed your help. Please.
FO300030706	Kid, out here cocky will get you killed. I've seen a Super Mutant strike squad like that take down five well armed soldiers.
FO300030707	But fine, next time you want to take them on yourself and buy yourself an early retirement, go right ahead.
FO300030708	I'm Sentinel Lyons of the Lyons' Pride. With the Brotherhood of Steel.
FO300030709	Don't worry. We're on your side. At least I hope so.
FO300030710	Thanks for the assist. I didn't know this place was so dangerous.
FO300030711	MQ05DadDeathConv
FO300030712	I'm just passing through. Don't bug me with your problems.
FO300030713	Please, we really do need someone to stop the Mechanist and the AntAgonizer. We can pay!
FO300030714	They've been using this town as their battlefield, and now some of the merchants are avoiding us! If something isn't done, the town will be ruined!
FO300030715	You seem to be pretty calm, considering there was just war in your streets.
FO300030716	That must be the twentieth time I've seen those two go at it. They're our problem citizens: the Mechanist and the AntAgonizer.
FO300030717	A while ago, we were attacked by the AntAgonizer -- that woman with the ants, obviously. The Mechanist saved the town with his robots.
FO300030718	That was all well and good, but I swear their fights are getting bigger, and it's been driving off the merchants. They simply won't leave!
FO300030719	What was all that about? Who were those people?
FO300030720	A while ago, we were attacked by the AntAgonizer - that woman with the ants, obviously. The Mechanist saved the town with his robots.
FO300030721	That was all well and good, but I swear their fights are getting bigger, and it's been driving off the merchants. They simply won't leave!
FO300030722	Mirelurk gives me gas. I'd rather have squirrel.
FO300030723	I'm partial to Mirelurk Cakes myself.
FO300030724	Then you are in for a treat!
FO300030725	Any fool can use a gun.
FO300030726	Said like a soon-to-be-dead Wastelander.
FO300030727	Man, I love guns. Nothing's better than the kick of a .44!
FO300030728	Ain't seen many of those around lately. They're tough to come by.
FO300030729	You're a junkie? Tell me where you keep your stash. Now!
FO300030730	Okay, okay! I steal them from Doc Preston. There's an empty room across from the Staley's. I hide them in the file cabinet in there.
FO300030731	Have you heard any interesting gossip?
FO300030732	Well, I really shouldn't tell you, but have you heard about Paulie Cantelli?
FO300030733	He's addicted to chems. His poor wife, Cindy, is at her wits end.
FO300030734	You haven't heard? Angela has the hots for Diego.
FO300030735	But since he's a priest, he's been putting her off. One of these days she's just going to jump his bones.
FO300030736	So, are there any fun rumors flying around Rivet City?
FO300030737	They say Mister Lopez is losing it. He stands on the top of the bridge tower for hours at a time, just staring out over the city.
FO300030738	Are there any other rumors you've heard?
FO300030739	Bannon is trying to blackmail Seagraves Holmes.
FO300030740	That's pretty underhanded, even for Bannon.
FO300030741	Once word gets out, I bet the market vendors won't want him to represent them anymore.
FO300030742	Thank you for your help, citizen.
FO300030743	I found this letter in Seagrave's room. I thought you should see it.
FO300030744	This is bad. Seagrave Holmes was angling for a seat on the council.
FO300030745	He can forget about that now. Once the market vendors get wind of his past, they'll never trust him. Too bad.
FO300030746	Tell Danvers about that letter right away. That will squash any hope he has of replacing me on the council.
FO300030747	Don't tell her I asked you to find it though. That would backfire in a nasty way.
FO300030748	Bannon tells me you're trying to steal his Council seat.
FO300030749	Steal it? Hardly. He runs the council like it's his own personal bank account.
FO300030750	He's supposed to represent all the market businesses, not just himself. It's about time he was replaced.
FO300030751	If you had read that letter you'd know I'm no slaver and you know I'm not dealing with them.
FO300030752	But if that letter gets out, they won't trust me. I'll never get a seat on the council and Bannon will make me pay for trying to replace him.
FO300030753	If you care about Rivet City half as much as I do, tell Danvers that Bannon is blackmailing me, but don't show her the letter.
FO300030754	You've been doing business with Slavers, and I have a letter that proves it.
FO300030755	It's really none of my business.
FO300030756	Don't want to get mixed up in politics, eh? Don't blame you.
FO300030757	Whoever this Seagrave is, you think he's a threat to your influence?
FO300030758	A threat? No, of course not! Well, maybe. He wants to replace me on the council.
FO300030759	Well, lets just say I would be very appreciative.
FO300030760	Seagrave? Oh yeah. He's clueless.
FO300030761	So you've met him, eh? Well he wants to replace me on the council. Now, I can't have that. No siree.
FO300030762	Well, lets just say I would be very appreciative.
FO300030763	Ha ha ha! Yes! Strong soldiers to smash the humans for good!
FO300030764	More of us if green stuff work. It makes many mistakes. We dump bodies in cave too many times.
FO300030765	Ha ha ha, yes! More of them mean more of us soon.
FO300030766	Let them come to us! We'll take them apart! Then when they weak, we put them in green stuff!
FO300030767	Stupid Fox say men will come to us one day. To take green stuff.
FO300030768	Others go to find some. We must have more of us to stop the humans!
FO300030769	We almost out of green stuff.
FO300030770	Who's this Sister? A nun?
FO300030771	No. He's a big, scary Slaver. He's staying at the Weatherly Hotel. I try to avoid him because he might recognize me.
FO300030772	Hey, it's none of my business. Let the past be the past.
FO300030773	That's easy to say. You don't have anyone from your past after you.
FO300030774	I just feel so helpless.
FO300030775	Lady, you're nuts.
FO300030776	I'm sorry. I'm just so on edge all the time.
FO300030777	Sounds like a plan, man.
FO300030778	All right! You and me, just hangin'.
FO300030779	I know your type. You're a freeloader and a waste of breath.
FO300030780	Whoa! Dude! You don't have to get all in my face.
FO300030781	I'll just make myself scarce.
FO300030782	Heard any good stories lately?
FO300030783	Go talk to Vera if you want gossip. I don't talk bad about folks.
FO300030784	This place looks pretty easy to rob. You have any problems with thieves?
FO300030785	Don't get any cute ideas. Security is just a shout away.
FO300030786	Now, if you've got any medical issues, let's hear them.
FO300030787	Got any Chems? I could really use a fix.
FO300030788	You can get that crap down at A Quick Fix. It's in the market.
FO300030789	I'm a doctor, not a dealer. I'll fix you as best I can if you're hurt.
FO300030790	I like you. You're funny. I assume you sell Chems?
FO300030791	Yeah. Paulie and I. Our shop is in the market.
FO300030792	Boy, that sounded dumb! Where else would our shop be? Anyway, thanks. For being nice, that is.
FO300030793	Whoa! Slow down, lady. You're freaking me out.
FO300030794	Sorry. I get nervous easily. When I'm nervous, I'm fast. I mean, I talk. Fast that is. See, I'm doing it again.
FO300030795	Thank God! I can barely carry all this stuff.
FO300030796	Well, I'm not open just now, but I will be by daybreak. Stop by.
FO300030797	Suit yourself. Sooner or later everyone has stuff to unload that only I will take.
FO300030798	Anything? Chems? Guns? How about parts and junk?
FO300030799	Yep. I'll take it all. One man's junk is another man's treasure.
FO300030800	How do I know you won't rip me off?
FO300030801	You don't. No guarantees in the Wasteland. No rebates or exchanges either.
FO300030802	Oh, and you break it, you buy it.
FO300030803	You got a T-51b? No? Then you don't have everything.
FO300030804	A what?
FO300030805	Look, if you just want to crack wise, go somewhere else. But if you've got stuff you want to sell, then I'm your man.
FO300030806	You some sort of tough guy? You want to try me?
FO300030807	Ain't worth the ammo. Just walk away before security hauls you away.
FO300030808	Know where I can offload some guns?
FO300030809	You're kidding right? Flak and Shrapnel's, in the market. I'm Shrapnel, you idiot.
FO300030810	What's your problem? Loosen up, pal.
FO300030811	I'm short on time and your five minutes are up. See ya.
FO300030812	This peashooter has saved my ass more than once.
FO300030813	I'm sure that was just luck. You should upgrade. Check out our shop in the market.
FO300030814	Cute names. Did you make them up, or are you just trying to look tough?
FO300030815	Like that's your real name?
FO300030816	The names are good for business. And if you don't think I'm tough enough, just try me.
FO300030817	Do you have the big stuff? Flamers, Missile Launchers, stuff like that?
FO300030818	We usually have a few. I'd have to check the inventory.
FO300030819	Stop by the shop. Either Shrapnel or I will show you what we've got.
FO300030820	Aren't you afraid someone will use your own guns to rob you?
FO300030821	Here? In Rivet City?
FO300030822	I'm packing and most of the rest of these guys are packing. Not to mention security.
FO300030823	This is quite a selection, but they're all in lousy condition.
FO300030824	I don't put the good stuff out on the table. If you're interested, I can show you the stuff in the locker.
FO300030825	I hunt for my own food.
FO300030826	Ah, a true Wasteland warrior. Still, you should stop by my Galley in the market and try a Mirelurk cake. I'm sure you'll love it.
FO300030827	I am getting a bit hungry.
FO300030828	Perfect timing then! My Galley is in the market, at the far end. I'll save you some Mirelurk Cakes.
FO300030829	How do I know your slop is even edible?
FO300030830	You should come by and try the Mirelurk Cakes. They're my specialty.
FO300030831	So what happened to Project Purity?
FO300030832	In the year before you were born, things became difficult.
FO300030833	There had always been something of a "mutant problem" in the city, but it became worse. They attacked more frequently, and more aggressively.
FO300030834	Support for the project eroded as time went on, when we couldn't produce any significant results. Progress came to a halt. And then you were born.
FO300030835	From what I understand, things happened quickly after that. It became too dangerous for the others to stay, and so the project was abandoned.
FO300030836	Doctor Li and her team left for what became Rivet City, and Project Purity has sat waiting ever since.
FO300030837	How did mom really die?
FO300030838	I understand that you have reason to question a good many things I've told you over the years.
FO300030839	If nothing else, please believe that she loved you very much.
FO300030840	What's the big deal about water, anyway?
FO300030841	The Vault you grew up in had its own water purification system. Clean water was never a worry. Out here, things are different.
FO300030842	Water out here is never clean, and almost always irradiated. It's barely able to sustain any kind of normal life.
FO300030843	If we can change that, humanity has a real chance at rebuilding. Starting over.
FO300030844	What exactly is this "Project Purity"?
FO300030845	It started as an idea, really. Remember the Bible passage your mother loved so much?
FO300030846	Free, clean water for everyone. What a difference it could make in the lives of everyone here in the Wastes.
FO300030847	Over time, that idea took the form of a purifier. Not like the one in the Vault, though.
FO300030848	This one was gigantic, capable of purifying millions of gallons of water at once.
FO300030849	We used the old Jefferson Memorial for the location, right on DC's Tidal Basin. Someday soon, I hope you'll see it work.
FO300030850	Where can I find the fuse box?
FO300030851	Head back downstairs. The one you're looking for is underneath the mainframe room, I think.
FO300030852	Right, because I'm supposed to know exactly what you're talking about.
FO300030853	Where are the flood control pumps?
FO300030854	Dad's got you doing the dirty work, huh? Well, good for you. Doesn't hurt to get your hands dirty.
FO300030855	You'll find the pumps down in the sub-basement. It's one level below where we are now.
FO300030856	Just look for the big switch on the wall. Throw that, and the pumps'll fire right up.
FO300030857	You're kidding me, right?
FO300030858	Ugh. They're downstairs in the sub-basement. You want me to hold your hand while you look for them?
FO300030859	Aaaaaaahh!
FO300030860	They just burst in, and James locked the door. Why would he lock me out? What does he think he's doing?
FO300030861	I'm meeting him here.
FO300030862	I already found my father, but thanks. He's on his way here.
FO300030863	Another do-gooder? No matter! My plans can wait for now, Mechanist!
FO300030864	What's this? A new minion? We'll settle this another day, AntAgonizer!
FO300030865	I've got some stuff that needs repairs.
FO300030866	Let me take a look.
FO300030867	No problem, as long as you're good for it.
FO300030868	Sure, I can fix most anything. Let me see what you've got.
FO300030869	FFEU18RaiderTaunt
FO300030870	Just say the word and it's all over. Course then we'd have to skin you alive and eat your liver.
FO300030871	Pain! Pain is your only friend!
FO300030872	Don't flinch, you coward!
FO300030873	Are you gonna cry? Come on, cry for me!
FO300030874	You think you're good enough to run with us?
FO300030875	That's right. Love the pain! Embrace the pain!
FO300030876	Pain is your friend.
FO300030877	Is that your son running around here?
FO300030878	Yeah. That's James. My own little trouble making brat.
FO300030879	I'd sell him to you if they'd let me.
FO300030880	Unless you've got any more personal questions, I'm busy.
FO300030881	You don't have to be such a bitch...
FO300030882	Oh really? My husband ran off and got himself killed, and left me to raise his little brat. So don't you tell me how I should or shouldn't be.
FO300030883	You're a fool to pass up a chance at love with Angela.
FO300030884	Father Clifford says she is my trial. My temptation.
FO300030885	I must chose between her and the Church. I have chosen the Church.
FO300030886	Men are such pigs. Forget him.
FO300030887	You're right. I should. But I can't.
FO300030888	Do the men on this ship give you much trouble?
FO300030889	You mean like hitting on me?
FO300030890	No. Most of them are polite. Even the ones like Diego that I'd want to flirt with seem to ignore me.
FO300030891	There are no bad children. Only bad parents.
FO300030892	What a load of crap. Obviously you've never had to take care of some squealing little brat.
FO300030893	What?! No!
FO300030894	Now that I have your suit, I'd say you don't have a chance at all. Time to die.
FO300030895	Wait! I'm not a secret agent! I'm here to help!
FO300030896	Wait! I'm not a secret agent! I'm here to help!
FO300030897	Certainly. Good luck in your new life.
FO300030898	Your mind-games won't work with me, ant-spawn!
FO300030899	Now that I've unmasked you, it's time to put an end to your lies and treachery! Percival, attack!
FO300030900	You really have lost your mind, haven't you?
FO300030901	Your mind-games won't work with me, ant-spawn!
FO300030902	Now that I've unmasked you, it's time to put an end to your lies and treachery! Percival, attack!
FO300030903	You really have lost your mind, haven't you?
FO300030904	That's enough about them.
FO300030905	I most heartily agree!
FO300030906	Well, okay.
FO300030907	Fine by me.
FO300030908	Do you know anything about the AntAgonizer or the Mechanist?
FO300030909	If it'll help, I'm glad to.
FO300030910	Can I ask you more about the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist?
FO300030911	You mean the super-heroes? Yeah, I try to watch all of their fights!
FO300030912	What do you know about the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist?
FO300030913	Roe hired you put a stop to their shit, did he? Guess he finally listened when I told him I haven't got the time to do it myself.
FO300030914	It's easy enough to hide inside when those two square off, but they're only getting worse about it all.
FO300030915	What do you know about the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist?
FO300030916	What do you want to know about them?
FO300030917	What do you know about the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist?
FO300030918	You mean, apart from having cheesy names? Actually, I think I might know something useful.
FO300030919	One of the traders told me she sounded like a girl he used to know. Girl's whole family was wiped out by ants, not long before she showed up here.
FO300030920	But they never found any trace of her body. Said her name was "Tanya Christoff." That might just be our little AntAgonizer.
FO300030921	I know Dom doesn't want me just killing them. He and the Mechanist used to be friends or something.
FO300030922	All I know is next time they come to town, I bet I could solve the whole problem with one bullet for each of them.
FO300030923	I sure am. Two hundred caps, if you can find where the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist hide, and get them to end their pointless fighting in town.
FO300030924	You only need to stop one of them, really. Nowadays, I think they only stay in Canterbury to fight each other. So, what do you say?
FO300030925	You still offering that job?
FO300030926	Excellent! Without him, the AntAgonizer should be on her way, and Canterbury Commons is safe again! Relatively speaking, of course.
FO300030927	Now, I do believe this is our agreed upon payment for your fine services rendered. Thank you, once again!
FO300030928	I took care of the Mechanist. There won't be any more fighting in the streets.
FO300030929	Excellent! Without her, the Mechanist should be on his way, and Canterbury Commons is safe again! Relatively speaking, of course.
FO300030930	Now, I do believe this is our agreed upon payment for your fine services rendered. Thank you, once again!
FO300030931	I took care of the AntAgonizer. There won't be any more fighting in the streets.
FO300030932	That's grand! I do believe it's fair to say you've saved Canterbury. And unlike that Mechanist, you did so with significantly less stress all around!
FO300030933	Now, I do believe this is our agreed upon payment for your fine services rendered. And a little bonus, as a special thank-you!
FO300030934	I took care of both of them. There won't be any more fighting in the streets.
FO300030935	He promised me money for a job. Pay up, or else.
FO300030936	Yeah, he told me. I wish you didn't have to make the super heroes go away, but I guess Uncle Roe knew what the town needed.
FO300030937	He told me to pay you for the work. He always did say, "Money comes and goes, but a contract's forever." At least the town's safe, now.
FO300030938	I just finished a job for your late uncle. I hope he told you to pay me.
FO300030939	Got anything else?
FO300030940	Sorry, we need every piece of equipment we've got. I can spare the gun and the armor, but that's about it.
FO300030941	The Minigun is more my speed.
FO300030942	You got it. Use it well, and take down some more Muties with it for us.
FO300030943	Consider this place your home away from home. If you're ever in the neighborhood again, you're more than welcome to take shelter here.
FO300030944	I guess that does it. See you 'round, kid.
FO300030945	I'll go for the armor.
FO300030946	The armor it is. Wear it with pride, kid. We do.
FO300030947	Consider this place your home away from home. If you're ever in the neighborhood again, you're more than welcome to take shelter here.
FO300030948	I guess that does it. See you 'round, kid.
FO300030949	Where can I get some more ammo around here?
FO300030950	Well, if you've picked the Mutie corpses clean, there isn't much else to scrounge.
FO300030951	I dunno if you came across it or not, but one of our guys dropped on the second floor stairwell. He had an ammo crate with him.
FO300030952	Gonna have to get the code from Butcher though.
FO300030953	On our way to the roof, one of our guys got scragged. Poor son-of-a-bitch get blown apart by a frag.
FO300030954	I think he went down on the second floor stairwell of this place. You find him, and you'll find his ammo crate.
FO300030955	Ask Butcher for the code though. We lock that stuff so the Muties can't steal what's inside.
FO300030956	We lost a good man on the retreat to this godforsaken roof. Theo. Newest guy in the group too.
FO300030957	He got killed on the second floor stairwell of the hotel. He was carrying our ammo supply with him.
FO300030958	Here, let me give you the code. The more ammo we have the better!
FO300030959	Let me ask you about something else.
FO300030960	Okay, go ahead.
FO300030961	Got anything for these injuries?
FO300030962	Yeah, here you go. It's all I've got.
FO300030963	Sorry. I only had one Stimpak to spare. Hang in there.
FO300030964	Injuries? You look fine to me.
FO300030965	I've been thinking about getting into the trade. You need a dog catcher?
FO300030966	But maybe we can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement, just the two of us. You think you got what it takes?
FO300030967	Can you give me a haircut?
FO300030968	The damned G.O.A.T. said I'm supposed to be a hairdresser, but that ain't me!
FO300030969	I'm a barber, you got that? There's a difference!
FO300030970	Butch, what do you do in the Vault?
FO300030971	Sure, fine, whatever.
FO300030972	I'm gonna barber the hell outta that hair!
FO300030973	Okay, hold still.
FO300030974	Sure, fine, whatever.
FO300030975	I'm gonna barber the hell outta your hair!
FO300030976	Okay, hold still.
FO300030977	PFLaugh
FO300030978	HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
FO300030979	PFFFJotunAnguish
FO300030980	FATHER! NO!
FO300030981	Why did you kill that bartender?
FO300030982	He put water in my vodka to make more caps from me. Make the drink weak and try to charge me more!
FO300030983	Maybe the next bartender, he won't be so stupid, eh? HAHAHAHAHAHA!
FO300030984	Well, you're dead meat now. Give me all your stuff.
FO300030985	You'll have to kill us first. Go ahead. Shoot me. I dare you.
FO300030986	What is Underworld?
FO300030987	It's a city of Ghouls. It's the only place in the Wasteland that belongs to our kind.
FO300030988	It's hidden inside the Museum of History.
FO300030989	What are you doing wandering around out here?
FO300030990	We were on our way to Underworld, but we couldn't make it past the Super Mutants.
FO300030991	So now we're just going to find our own place in the Wasteland.
FO300030992	There's a locked door up ahead. I can open it, but it'll take some time.
FO300030993	RadioGNRPlayerExploitsRELAY
FO300030994	Curious. Many years ago, I survived by drinking from fresh bloodpacks I recovered from hospital ruins.
FO300030995	The problem was that these bloodpacks were scarce.
FO300030996	What do you propose?
FO300030997	Let me see your Chems.
FO300030998	Yeah, I got some stuff around here. But it'll cost you.
FO300030999	You know where I can buy some chems around here?
FO300031000	Hey, it's your body, do what you want to it.
FO300031001	If you're planning on overdosing, just make sure you pay me first.
FO300031002	Trade up front. No exceptions. Especially not for junkies.
FO300031003	They will run out of time soon. Then they bleed.
FO300031004	Rangers will pay for all those they kill!
FO300031005	Don't take prisoners! Kill them all!
FO300031006	None of them will leave here alive.
FO300031007	They very powerful. Kill many of us.
FO300031008	Right on. Thanks.
FO300031009	If it keeps you happy and your gun in your holster, then it's well worth it to me.
FO300031010	Anytime, man. Any time at all.
FO300031011	No problem at all.
FO300031012	Hey, thanks. Keep it coming.
FO300031013	If it keeps you happy and your gun in your holster, then it's well worth it to me.
FO300031014	Anytime, man. Any time at all.
FO300031015	If it means that much to you, I'll take it.
FO300031016	You're an example to us all.
FO300031017	It does. Thank you.
FO300031018	Please, keep doing what you do.
FO300031019	Certainly. Thank you.
FO300031020	Bless you.
FO300031021	No. Thank you.
FO300031022	Certainly. It's the least I could do after all you've done.
FO300031023	MQ11SarahAirlockLines
FO300031024	Okay, let's get this over with. Cycle the airlock, will you?
FO300031025	I can't get in there until you cycle the airlock. Go hit the button.
FO300031026	You have to cycle the airlock before I can get to the control panel. Hurry up!
FO300031027	All right! Now that's what I'm talking about!
FO300031028	Really? Wow, tell me all about it? Did you get blown up?
FO300031029	No need to bother testing this. I've already been to Minefield.
FO300031030	I guess you've been around a bit! So, tell me about what you found!
FO300031031	No need to test that theory. I've already found food and medicine there.
FO300031032	I guess you've been around a bit! So, tell me about what you found!
FO300031033	No need to test that theory. I've only found food there.
FO300031034	Tenpenny is dead. I watched his brains splatter. <Lie.>
FO300031035	Don't lie to me. The whole wasteland would be talking about it if Tenpenny died.
FO300031036	Come back when you've done it right.
FO300031037	You're right. Why bother with a trophy of one pitiful human, when I can go forth and make a trophy of the entire world!
FO300031038	But when the time comes, remember: as a friend of the Ant Queen's court, you will know the mercy of a quick, painless death.
FO300031039	Now, leave me. I must prepare to leave the pitiful town of Canterbury and plan for greater conquests.
FO300031040	Don't waste your time with this suit. It isn't worthy of your attention.
FO300031041	Were it in any other hands, I would worry. But I know I can trust you, my faithful sidekick.
FO300031042	Now, I must return to tending my robots. Canterbury may be safe, but I must now look to the rest of the Wasteland.
FO300031043	The AntAgonizer may be gone, but if the world is ever threatened again, the Mechanist must be ready!
FO300031044	You don't need to worry about this suit. There are other threats out there.
FO300031045	You raise an excellent point, good citizen! It would only slow down my reckless assault upon evil!
FO300031046	Now, I must return to tending my robots. Canterbury may be safe, but I must now look to the rest of the Wasteland.
FO300031047	The AntAgonizer may be gone, but if the world is ever threatened again, the Mechanist must be ready!
FO300031048	You don't need to worry about this suit. There are other threats out there.
FO300031049	MQ11IntercomLine
FO300031050	Get in the airlock. I'll cycle it for you so you can enter the code.
FO300031051	You have to get in the airlock before I can cycle it and let you in there.
FO300031052	We're running out of time! You need to get in that airlock now!
FO300031053	So, you guys looking for new recruits?
FO300031054	That's a negative.
FO300031055	We've got too many local conscripts as it is. Most are undertrained and too damned trigger happy for their own good.
FO300031056	Our very own Initiate Reddin is a sterling example.
FO300031057	I'm sure.
FO300031058	You can handle yourself, I'll give you that.
FO300031059	But let's not get carried away.
FO300031060	<yawn> I'm going to bed.
FO300031061	I suppose it's time to eat.
FO300031062	I'd better get to work.
FO300031063	Time to feed the heifer.
FO300031064	I'm whupped. I need some shut-eye.
FO300031065	Better get some grub while there's still some left.
FO300031066	I'm tired. <yawn> Time for bed.
FO300031067	I'm starved. I hope there's enough today.
FO300031068	Well, that stone won't carve itself.
FO300031069	Time to eat. I have to keep my energy up.
FO300031070	I'm turning in. I need to be sharp tomorrow.
FO300031071	Guess I'd better get some chow.
FO300031072	I'm going to hit the sack.
FO300031073	Here you go you stupid cow. Don't eat it all at once.
FO300031074	Looks safe out there.
FO300031075	Hmmm.
FO300031076	Better have some check that out.
FO300031077	Nothing. Good.
FO300031078	I'd like to report someone.
FO300031079	Oh, really?
FO300031080	If someone took your stuff, go get it back. If they shoot at you, shoot back.
FO300031081	Otherwise, I've got to see it for myself before I'm gonna do anything.
FO300031082	What do you people do here all day?
FO300031083	We're the lucky ones. We don't have to fight just to survive.
FO300031084	We have normal jobs. I clean the halls. It might not look like it, but you should have seen it before.
FO300031085	Are you related to Henry Young?
FO300031086	Henry's my husband.
FO300031087	I have a daughter, C.J. too. You'll see her running around here with James Hargrave.
FO300031088	She's my daughter. You can usually find her running around with that James Hargrave.
FO300031089	Are you related to C.J.?
FO300031090	That's all for now, I guess.
FO300031091	Okay.
FO300031092	Nice gun. I've never seen one like that.
FO300031093	Yeah, it is nice. I don't even sleep without it under my pillow.
FO300031094	My father made gun ammunition for a living. Taught me everything about how firearms work.
FO300031095	So, I've spent my downtime tinkering with guns like my 10mm Ultra SMG here. It's like a hobby I guess.
FO300031096	You recovered all of that stuff in the Preservation Society's museum?
FO300031097	Oh no. There is more than a lifetime's supply of grade A crap in that place. Couldn't possibly do it alone. Like you, he hires anyone off the street.
FO300031098	Honestly, I don't care what he does with that stuff. As long as the caps keep flowing, I'll be there to collect.
FO300031099	How did you get into the relic hunting business?
FO300031100	I dunno. I grew up pretty much like every other girl in this crappy world. Spent most of my life just trying to keep away from Slavers.
FO300031101	One day out in the Wastes, I stumbled across some poor bastard's body. On the body I found info leading to some famous document.
FO300031102	I had heard that Abraham Washington was looking for these scraps of paper, so I went after the thing. Turned out to be the Constitution.
FO300031103	After he loaded me up with caps, I got piss drunk, got laid and was happy for the first time in a while. I haven't looked back since.
FO300031104	Since we're done now, why don't you tell me about yourself?
FO300031105	Ha, I'm surprised that you care. Usually everyone looks out for themselves nowadays.
FO300031106	What is it you wanna know?
FO300031107	My dearest Little Moonbeam. I know you've been waiting to hear what happened to me.
FO300031108	I came to the Statesman Hotel to meet the buyer and the deal went bad. We shot each other, and now I think I'm dying.
FO300031109	You're a strong girl and I know you can use everything I taught you to survive alone.
FO300031110	Please forgive me, sweetie. I only wanted to make the best for us. Daddy loves you very much. Goodbye.
FO300031111	So, whatever happened to your father?
FO300031112	What?!
FO300031113	I can't believe you brought this to me. I don't know what to say but thank you.
FO300031114	Wait! Here, take my 10mm Ultra SMG. It's never let me down. Besides, I won't really need it anymore.
FO300031115	Sydney, I found a note from your father. He didn't abandon you.
FO300031116	I thought he was the best. My mom was long gone, so all we had was each other. He used to call me his "little moonbeam." How sappy is that?
FO300031117	But when I was 14, he vanished and left me all alone. Never even said goodbye. I cried for a week.
FO300031118	Do I have to tell you what it's like for a young woman alone in the Wasteland at that age?
FO300031119	I don't know where he went, and I don't care. I just hope he got what he deserved, the son-of-a-bitch!
FO300031120	What happened to your father?
FO300031121	Sorry. There's some things I still want to keep to myself. Maybe when I get to trust you better.
FO300031122	Nice gun. I've never seen one like that.
FO300031123	Yeah, it is nice. I don't even sleep without it under my pillow.
FO300031124	My father made gun ammunition for a living. Taught me everything about how firearms work.
FO300031125	So, I've spent my downtime tinkering with guns like my 10mm Ultra SMG here. It's like a hobby I guess.
FO300031126	Nah, I was just kidding.
FO300031127	Well that's just plain rude. I would hope you'd be kinder to an old man just trying to serve his nation!
FO300031128	By bringing this to me, do you realize you've both just written yourselves into the history books?
FO300031129	You're both true American heroes and will be remembered for this glorious day!
FO300031130	Sydney's name will forever be memorialized for her great sacrifice. She was a patriot and will be missed.
FO300031131	But enough of that. Allow me to present you with some sort of compensation for your deed.
FO300031132	By bringing this to me, do you realize you've both just written yourselves into the history books?
FO300031133	You're both true American heroes and will be remembered for this glorious day!
FO300031134	But enough of that. Allow me to present you with some sort of compensation for your deed.
FO300031135	I will award Sydney's promised bounty to her personally. No need to worry yourself about that.
FO300031136	By bringing this to me, do you realize you've just written yourself into the history books?
FO300031137	You're a true American hero and will be remembered for this glorious day!
FO300031138	But enough of that. Allow me to present you with some sort of compensation for your deed.
FO300031139	By bringing this to me, do you realize you've just written yourself into the history books?
FO300031140	You're a true American hero and will be remembered for this glorious day!
FO300031141	But enough of that. Allow me to present you with some sort of compensation for your deed.
FO300031142	What? You have the Declaration? Unbelievable!
FO300031143	Are you certain this time? Or is this another joke?
FO300031144	Really? Oh, how convenient!
FO300031145	I might just be able to take care of that for you, but first let me do a little examination. How do you feel?
FO300031146	I'm already incredibly irradiated. Can't you tell?
FO300031147	Really? Oh, how convenient!
FO300031148	I should be able to take care of that for you, but first let me do a little examination. How do you feel?
FO300031149	I'm already a bit irradiated. Check for yourself.
FO300031150	I'm looking for someone named Abraham Washington.
FO300031151	He has a "museum" on the Midship Deck called the Capital Preservation Society. Shouldn't be hard to find. Just follow the signs.
FO300031152	Let's talk about something else.
FO300031153	Certainly.
FO300031154	The Super Mutants are coming from Vault 87. It's their breeding ground.
FO300031155	This information is invaluable! Well done!
FO300031156	Anything you can tell me about the Super Mutants?
FO300031157	In all that time, all we've managed to do is contain the threat. Hold them back, so they don't overrun every blasted settlement out here.
FO300031158	But we don't really "know" anything. Where they're from, why they've infested the D.C. ruins.
FO300031159	Oh? Have you learned something?
FO300031160	Elder Lyons, we should talk about the Super Mutants.
FO300031161	My child, you seem to have learned more in the past week than I have in twenty years!
FO300031162	Anything more you can tell me about the Super Mutants?
FO300031163	What do you know about the Enclave?
FO300031164	More than anyone else, I dare say. Certainly enough to know they're the greatest threat the Capital Wasteland has ever faced.
FO300031165	The Brotherhood of Steel has encountered the Enclave before, you see. Over thirty years ago, back in California.
FO300031166	Then, they were led by a President Richardson. Now we've got this Eden to contend with.
FO300031167	It matters not -- now, as before, they seek to control and destroy, all in the guise of restoring order. Your father, I fear, was just the beginning.
FO300031168	Well don't just stand there gawking, get your ass down here and give me a hand!
FO300031169	Up ahead should be the door to the Archives Strongroom. That's where they keep the Declaration.
FO300031170	According to the plans, the turret generator is somewhere in this room. Disable it, and it should make our lives easier.
FO300031171	There's all sorts of shortcuts through maintenance doors and utility gates to bypass security if you can get through 'em.
FO300031172	They kept the Declaration in the Archives Strongroom that's at the end of the East wing here. We'll have to make our way to it.
FO300031173	This is the long way down to the East Wing. I'd suggest we head back to the Rotunda and take the cargo lift.
FO300031174	I bet you aren't afraid of anything. Would you steal some ammo for me?
FO300031175	Of course I'm not afraid. I'll take it and he'll never know. I'll have it by tomorrow.
FO300031176	Sure. I pinched this from his table. He never even saw me.
FO300031177	I can get you some more by tomorrow.
FO300031178	Hey, did you ever steal any ammo from Flak and Shrapnel for me?
FO300031179	Lies! Grognak could never defeat me! He's not even real! Not like the AntAgonizer!
FO300031180	I'll have no more of your insolence! Ant royal guards, kill this interloper!
FO300031181	From what I read, Grognak totally kicked her ass!
FO300031182	MS02AntOrigin2A
FO300031183	I'll give you the suit. No one ever has to see the AntAgonizer again. Just please, let me have another chance.
FO300031184	I read that the AntAgonizer was an orphaned girl who could still be redeemed.
FO300031185	What? No! No children's book could possibly capture the true depth of the AntAgonizer!
FO300031186	You got this "AntAgonizer" idea from a comic, didn't you?
FO300031187	Tell me about your trade caravan.
FO300031188	I provide food, drinks, and discreet chemicals to discerning customers around the Wasteland. I help ease the suffering of my fellow man. For a price.
FO300031189	I don't have a home office, exactly, but I organize much of my trade with Ernest Roe, in Canterbury Commons.
FO300031190	I scour the wasteland for the very best pieces of trash, the height of detritus, and the veritable pick of the litter. It's all valuable to someone.
FO300031191	And I always make sure to make my rounds through Canterbury Commons. Their mayor, Roe, always has a place for a clever junkman like myself.
FO300031192	See, the world's a dangerous and unbalanced place. So I realized, the only way to bring peace was to make sure that everyone could be dangerous!
FO300031193	So, with a little bit of help from the mayor of Canterbury Commons, I set up this caravan. I can't give the weapons away for free, but I come close!
FO300031194	My caravan sells clothing and armor, to decorate and protect the body while it endures the ravages of the physical world.
FO300031195	My travels take me from Canterbury Commons to where there is true need of this protection. After all, this is what they'll pay the most for.
FO300031196	Why did you damage me? You're supposed to be a healing robot!
FO300031197	There has been an error in the medical subsystem. Please run a level two diagnostic.
FO300031198	No.
FO300031199	Aren't you a little young for all this?
FO300031200	I am the last of his line. They say my soul was forged from eternal steel, but I don't believe that. I'm really just a normal boy.
FO300031201	What do you make of the Enclave, Squire?
FO300031202	And some of their technology is amazing! Vertibirds! Plasma weapons that can turn a man to goo!
FO300031203	I don't suppose you know anything about the Super Mutants?
FO300031204	Oh yes! I've studied them quite a bit since I've been here!
FO300031205	But the worst of all? The Behemoth! He's a giant! I saw one once, outside the Citadel walls. Sooo scary.
FO300031206	The Super Mutants are all over the city ruins, but Elder Lyons doesn't think they're actually from there, or we would have found their home by now.
FO300031207	It kind of seems like they're looking for something, but we're not really sure what that is.
FO300031208	What about the Brotherhood's history in this area?
FO300031209	We first arrived in the Capital Wasteland in 2255. In those first couple of years, we discovered the Citadel, Super Mutants, and Project Purity!
FO300031210	At least for a little while. But we were stretched thin as it was, even back then. We had to pull our forces out. When we did, the place was overrun.
FO300031211	I need medical supplies.
FO300031212	Sure thing. Here's what I have.
FO300031213	Sure, here's what I can spare.
FO300031214	Hey, can you hook me up with some chems?
FO300031215	Sure sure. I got it all. Check it out.
FO300031216	Sure thing, man. Sure thing.
FO300031217	Care to share anything about the Super Mutants?
FO300031218	You've seen them, so you know what we know. What more is there to say?
FO300031219	Foul, detestable beasts. They're like an infestation. We cut them down, and they return, again and again.
FO300031220	Always so determined to kill or capture. But why?
FO300031221	The Brotherhood has been battling Super Mutants for decades. First out West, then in Chicago. Now here.
FO300031222	But this group of Super Mutants is different, somehow. Physically, yes, but mentally as well. If we knew where they came from, we'd know why.
FO300031223	Not really, no.
FO300031224	You know how many Uglies I've killed? More than all of Lyons' Pride combined, that's how many.
FO300031225	All it takes is a loaded weapon and the will to use it.
FO300031226	Oh, and a good way to get Ugly blood out of your armor. Little bit of Abraxo and some water -- works like a charm.
FO300031227	Yeah, the city ruins are crawling with them. They've pretty much overrun all of old D.C.
FO300031228	Do yourself, and us, a favor and stay as far away from there as humanly possible. Definitely no place for civilians.
FO300031229	Anything about the Super Mutants I should know?
FO300031230	Shoot 'em, they die. Stab 'em, they die. Strangle 'em? They die.
FO300031231	Hell, I've killed more of those yellow Frankensteins than any other member of the Pride. 'Cept maybe Gallows, with those crazy solo night ops of his.
FO300031232	Man, nothing dies like an Ugly. I once saw Colvin snipe the leg off of one at 200 yards. Thing pirouetted like a figure skater!
FO300031233	Why you think I ride these Initiates so hard? I make training hell so fighting those Uglies won't be.
FO300031234	So they have Plasma weapons! Bah! It's strong technology, I'll give you that, but limited in modability.
FO300031235	I've already started removing the compensators on our laser weapons to cut through the black devil Power Armor of theirs.
FO300031236	We'll drop them like any other meat, don't you worry.
FO300031237	They're sporting some pretty impressive Power Armor, I'll give them that. The Advanced Mark II.
FO300031238	But's that all right. With a few modifications, our own armor will more than handle anything they throw at it.
FO300031239	Quite a few, but most are distinctly unladylike, and unworthy of discussion.
FO300031240	I will tell you that the Brotherhood has encountered the Enclave before, and their motives were just as sinister then as they are now.
FO300031241	I've read the reports, seen the initial scans. But I can hardly believe it.
FO300031242	I figured those radio transmissions were just old recordings. Never figured the Enclave would actually show up, in the flesh.
FO300031243	But don't worry. Whatever they try, we'll be ready for it. I'll lead the Pride to knock them out tomorrow. If… my father permits it.
FO300031244	They're men. They're born, they live, they die. End of story.
FO300031245	There's meat under that armor, and meat can be ground…
FO300031246	Man, I don't know. Fighting Uglies is one thing, but we've never gone up against anyone that well trained or organized. Even their tech is better.
FO300031247	Don't get me wrong. The Pride's in it to win it, and I'll go down shooting if I have to. I just hope I don't have to.
FO300031248	What can you tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel?
FO300031249	I can see you're trying to appeal to my good nature. Pity for you I don't have one.
FO300031250	Can I come in?
FO300031251	Negative. No Super Mutants, civilians or traveling salesmen allowed.
FO300031252	Which are you?
FO300031253	That's an affirmative. You're clear to enter. But I still don't like it. Or you.
FO300031254	What is this place?
FO300031255	You're standing in front of the Citadel, headquarters to the Brotherhood of Steel. Capital Wasteland detachment.

FO300031260	He was developed as a super weapon, back in the days before the war. The first joint operation between RobCo and General Atomics International.
FO300031261	Apparently, he was meant to help liberate Alaska from the Chinese, but was never completed. They were forced to go in without him.
FO300031262	What can you tell me about the Lyons' Pride?
FO300031263	It's the best of the Brotherhood, bar none. No one gets in without my say-so.
FO300031264	You my friend, are talking about the most elite fighting force ever assembled within the Brotherhood of Steel.
FO300031265	Each of us was handpicked by Sentinel Lyons herself. You can't even realize what an honor that is. Sarah defines combat excellence.
FO300031266	We're the most elite tactical unit ever assembled in the Brotherhood of Steel, here or anywhere else. Hell, ain't nothin' Sarah's cubs can't handle.
FO300031267	I am, and have been since we first found him, well over twenty years ago.
FO300031268	"Liberty Prime" is the designation we found on file for him. Magnificent, don't you think? At least he will be, once all systems are operational.
FO300031269	Ah yes. Everyone asks about the robot. Hard not to, I admit.
FO300031270	His name is "Liberty Prime." Very patriotic. Built by a very proud nation, during a very desperate time.
FO300031271	We've had about as much success getting him working as they did. You should speak with Scribe Rothchild. He can tell you more.
FO300031272	So what's the deal with the robot?
FO300031273	Yes father.
FO300031274	You don't have to like it, Sarah. You just have to follow orders.
FO300031275	I don't like it.
FO300031276	I agree. Without the G.E.C.K., the purifier is useless to the Enclave anyway. They may give up before long.
FO300031277	And if you fail, then what? The risk is not worth the reward.
FO300031278	So we just wait until they decide we're next on the list? If the Pride goes in now, we might have a chance.
FO300031279	All I'm saying is, the longer we sit here, the more time they have to shore up their defenses. We should hit them sooner rather than later.
FO300031280	And how! I AM the only one in all of the Wasteland with the skill and the guts to perform facial reconstruction, you know.
FO300031281	Look. You're different from all those other jerkoffs, so I'll make you a deal. You want a little nip-tuck here and there, I'll do it for ya.
FO300031282	So, what do you want to look like?
FO300031283	You think you could perform a Facial Reconstruction on me?
FO300031284	What do you want to look like?
FO300031285	I need a Facial Reconstruction.
FO300031286	I know! He's the best son a Slaver could ever want!
FO300031287	Exactly! Haha!
FO300031288	Yeah. Wow. And what boy doesn't want to grow up to be like his dad? Especially your boy.
FO300031289	That's my boy! Just like his dad! Hearty and full of life! Haha!
FO300031290	Wasn't he, though! I am proud of him! You'd swear he was a professional drunk, just like his dad!
FO300031291	I'll get Frank to pour us a few cold ones! HAHAHA! Hey Frank! Two drinks over here! HAHAHAHA!
FO300031292	Better yet, how about five?
FO300031293	Do I ever say no?
FO300031294	Only if you're buying!
FO300031295	ALWAYS!
FO300031296	I know, man. I got bills to pay!
FO300031297	We gotta get some action around here.
FO300031298	Seriously. It's been dry as hell.
FO300031299	Christ, I know. Ever since those caravans went and hired some decent mercs, we haven't caught a damn thing.
FO300031300	I hear that.
FO300031301	Seriously. Eulogy's been bitchin' up a storm.
FO300031302	Yeah, I hear that Carolina Red hasn't even been able to get any good meat.
FO300031303	I ended up with a pack of heroes. They tried to escape. We ended up just having to put 'em down.
FO300031304	I thought we were gonna have a pretty good catch, but they ended up getting' sick before we could bring 'em back.
FO300031305	Little fuckers got away from us.
FO300031306	We didn't catch a damn thing.
FO300031307	Worse every year. Are we running out of Wastelanders or something?
FO300031308	Nada.
FO300031309	Pretty damn shitty. You know how it's been.
FO300031310	I ended up selling that one dude to the Raiders from Evergreen Mills!
FO300031311	Not too bad. A couple of deadbeat buyers though.
FO300031312	It could be worse.
FO300031313	Considering how bad it's been around here, I'm not unhappy.
FO300031314	CitTalk6Special
FO300031315	Fine. I'll practice on someone else. Thanks for nothing.
FO300031316	CitTalk6
FO300031317	Listen, let's talk about this some more later, okay? I have a decent tactical plan I can run by you.
FO300031318	Look, either way, we should hit the Bailey later and run through some drills. Sound good?
FO300031319	Tell you what. Let's hook up later and go see Scribe Bowditch. I heard he's been working on some new Power Armor mods. Can't hurt.
FO300031320	Elder Lyons does not sound like that. You're an idiot.
FO300031321	I've been practicing. Come on, we're a knightly order, right? I figure we should speak the part. I want to sound like Elder Lyons.
FO300031322	What are you doing?
FO300031323	Yes, sir!
FO300031324	Then it's decided. Sarah, you take the Pride and use the robot as support. Take our friend here and secure that purifier.
FO300031325	Honestly? I don't know. I think we can scrape by, and I suppose if we can't it won't matter in the long run anyway.
FO300031326	Rothchild, enough. Can you make it work?
FO300031327	So?
FO300031328	What? No! I mean, Li and I have solved the power problems, but we've only barely finished diagnostic tests.
FO300031329	All right, Sarah. The Pride goes in. But I want them to have some extra firepower. Rothchild, is it ready?
FO300031330	Send the Pride in. We can do it. We can win this!
FO300031331	I'm afraid you're right. We need to act now while we can.
FO300031332	If the Enclave has the G.E.C.K., there's nothing stopping them from starting the purifier. They'll figure out the code eventually.
FO300031333	That's all I needed to know.
FO300031334	Isn't it dangerous being this deep into the city?
FO300031335	Not really. The Super Mutants leave us alone. I guess whatever they do that turns people like them doesn't work on us.
FO300031336	The Brotherhood of Steel will fire on us if we're out in the open, but they don't bother us down here.
FO300031337	We've had some Raiders and Slavers poke their heads in, but we've got Charon and Cerberus and everyone else to take care of them.
FO300031338	I guess when it comes down to it, being this far out of everyone's way is a good deal for us.
FO300031339	How did all of the Ghouls end up here?
FO300031340	At first it was just a couple people after the war. This was one of the only places that wasn't falling down or on fire after the bombs fell.
FO300031341	I think that Carol is actually one of the few that were here then.
FO300031342	But, over the years, word got around. There had been Ghouls living in little pockets all around. Not really so much anymore.
FO300031343	Most of them either went feral or ended up here. I'm sure there are still a few out there, but anyone with any sense is in Underworld.
FO300031344	What was this place before the Ghouls moved in?
FO300031345	It used to be part of the Museum of History. The exhibit that used to be here was focused on what happens after death: hell and whatnot.
FO300031346	A lot of it was focused on this old book called "Paradise Lost." It's about a guy who goes to Hell. Pretty interesting stuff.
FO300031347	I found a big box of copies of the book in one of the back rooms. Here, take one. Nobody around here wants 'em.
FO300031348	It used to be part of the Museum of History. The exhibit that used to be here was focused on what happens after death: Hell and whatnot.
FO300031349	A lot of it was focused on this old book called "Paradise Lost." It's about a guy who goes to Hell. Pretty interesting stuff.
FO300031350	You should read the copy I gave you.
FO300031351	Do you know anything about Underworld?
FO300031352	Well, yeah. There's a lot of old pamphlets and stuff down here. I've pretty much read it all.
FO300031353	You don't get a lot of customers, do you?
FO300031354	No, not really. To tell you the truth, everyone around here who wants a gun already has one.
FO300031355	I spend most of my time sitting here reading old stuff I find around here. You end up learning a lot of interesting things that way!
FO300031356	You run this place with Greta?
FO300031357	We've been together longer than you've been alive.
FO300031358	Where do you do from there?
FO300031359	You're taking Greta's death really hard, aren't you?
FO300031360	What do you know about Underworld?
FO300031361	To tell you the truth, hon, I don't really know much about it. All I know is that it used to be some sort of exhibit.
FO300031362	Something about hell or the afterlife or something. Tulip knows that sort of stuff.
FO300031363	Not like anyone around here ever buys anything from that shop of hers.
FO300031364	He works for a guy up in Megaton. I think he might be a slave.
FO300031365	YOU SON OF A BITCH!
FO300031366	He was up in Megaton. At least he was until I killed him.
FO300031367	If you get up that way again, tell him that I said that I miss him and that I love him.
FO300031368	But, he shouldn't try to escape. It's too dangerous. No, no. He should stay put where he is. I couldn't bear the thought of him getting hurt.
FO300031369	He's working in a bar in Megaton.
FO300031370	He was up in Megaton. I'm afraid that he's dead.
FO300031371	Oh, that's wonderful news! I'm so glad! if you see him, please tell him that his mother misses him and loves him and that I hope he's happy.
FO300031372	But, he shouldn't come visit. It's too dangerous. No, no. He should stay put where he is.
FO300031373	All right. I'm going to go have a look around.
FO300031374	We've got a nice little deal going down here. We'd like to keep it nice.
FO300031375	CitTalkShortGeneric2
FO300031376	I thought as much.
FO300031377	Very well. Thank you for the update.
FO300031378	CitTalkShortGeneric
FO300031379	Enclave strength is at 100%. They're getting reinforcements from somewhere, but we still haven't determined the location of their headquarters.
FO300031380	Enclave troops have fortified the purifier complex. With those vertibirds, they're able to transport personnel at a remarkable rate.
FO300031381	There's been another Behemoth sighted in the Wasteland, in the Evergreen Mills region. That's heavy Raider country, so things could get interesting.
FO300031382	It appears the Enclave troops have moved beyond the purifier, into the surrounding Wasteland region. No telling how far they might spread.
FO300031383	I'm working on it, okay?
FO300031384	All right, all right. Do what you have to, but be careful.
FO300031385	Yeah, it's taken care of. Should be safe now.
FO300031386	Excellent. Let's get inside and get to work.

FO300031390	Wait a second! I handled Silver for you, and you still want me to pay?
FO300031391	It's called economics, kid. You got something I want and I got something you want. Nothing's free.
FO300031392	I told you the favor would earn you some caps if you really took care of it. Now, fork 'em over!
FO300031393	Forget it. I'll come back.
FO300031394	I'll be here.
FO300031395	Yeah, yeah. Here, take your 100 caps. I hope you choke on them.
FO300031396	How can you be so rude when I'm going to provide you with such a useful public service?
FO300031397	Your dad came through here, all right. Didn't stay long, though. Said he had some important business to attend to, and headed off to the city.
FO300031398	Something to do with Galaxy News Radio. Guess that'd be the place for you to start. Good hunting, and thanks for the caps.
FO300031399	Fine, here's your 100 caps.
FO300031400	Now that wasn't so difficult was it?
FO300031401	Your dad came through here, all right. Didn't stay long, though. Said he had some important business to attend to, and headed off to the city.

FO300031416	You, on the other hand, are expendable. Especially with an attitude like that.
FO300031417	Let's just leave this as an open offer. If I never see you again, I haven't lost anything.
FO300031418	Goodbye, Amata.
FO300031419	You'd better leave before I change my mind about letting you go.
FO300031420	Why not come with me? There's nothing here for you anymore.
FO300031421	No, I can't. Not with you, not now. You'd better leave before I change my mind about letting you go.
FO300031422	The door's open. You could come with me.
FO300031423	I would, if I only cared about myself.
FO300031424	I guess it's time for you to go deal with your father issues, while I deal with mine. Good luck. I will miss you, you know.
FO300031425	Time for me to go, Amata. My Dad's out there somewhere.
FO300031426	I guess it's time for you to go deal with your father issues, while I deal with mine. Good luck. I will miss you, you know.
FO300031427	Goodbye, Amata. It's time for me to go.
FO300031428	You could come with me, you know. Leave this place behind forever.
FO300031429	Goodbye, Amata.
FO300031430	You should come with me. It's not safe for you to stay.
FO300031431	Don't worry about me. Whatever happens, I'm sure I'll be in less danger than you. I can't imagine what you're going to find out there.
FO300031432	Goodbye, Amata.
FO300031433	Can I see what you have to trade?
FO300031434	Yeah, I suppose.
FO300031435	Sure. Just be quick about it.
FO300031436	Hey, I've been there! Those Super Mutants are all dead. It's safe now.
FO300031437	That is great news indeed!
FO300031438	As soon as Caleb gets what he needs, we can start our trip.
FO300031439	It would be a great favor to me if you would help him.
FO300031440	Enough with the inane banter! Just tell me already.
FO300031441	Fine. Some people just don't appreciate the spoken word.
FO300031442	This holotape contains the location of the military weapons cache. I hope you put them to good use and keep up the fight.

FO300031454	Project Purity would mean millions of gallons of pure, clean water for the people of the Capital Wasteland.
FO300031455	I simply cannot allow that to happen.
FO300031456	Here I sit, in the safety of the Citadel, while the people of the Wasteland thirst, and suffer, and die. Here I sit, a failed, feeble old man.
FO300031457	What have I really accomplished? How many have I truly helped? The Super Mutants still roam rampant. The people still die of thirst and radiation.
FO300031458	The Western Elders cease to acknowledge my existence. Some of my own people have even gone Outcast.
FO300031459	And now... the Enclave. Technologically superior. Infinitely resourceful. The time has come to pass the mantle to more able hands. But is she ready?
FO300031460	According to our latest reconnaissance report, Enclave soldiers have taken complete control of the Project Purity facility.
FO300031461	They've brutally murdered innocent scientists, including James. He went there to revive the project, and died for his efforts.
FO300031462	They will answer for their crimes. I haven't worked so hard just to sit idly by and watch the Enclave undo what little we've accomplished here.

FO300031465	Selfish? This is my child we're talking about, Madison! My child!
FO300031466	It's you and me, now, okay? You and me. But that's okay. So long as we've got each other, that's all that matters.
FO300031467	No, no, put that away. This one's on the house. And now a toast. To James and his cheery cherub. May your future be safe, bright, and boring as hell.
FO300031468	Yes, yes. Cardiology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry. Whatever your needs. You'll find I can handle, well… I can handle just about anything.
FO300031469	All right. Just remember one thing. We need a doctor, not a deadbeat. Fail to meet my expectations, and there will be repercussions.
FO300031470	Not so bad, huh? A bit chilly maybe, but we'll get used to that. A few decorations, some donated toys, and this place will feel just like home. Home…
FO300031471	It's okay! It's okay, see? Just a little cut. Good thing your daddy's a doctor, huh? I know just the right kind of kiss to make it better…
FO300031472	Ahh, it's my stupid ankle, doc. Sprained, broken, I don't know. Slipped on some grease in one of the maintenance tunnels.
FO300031473	You are to mend broken bones, prescribe medications, and see to the health of my residents. These "experiments" are a waste of time!
FO300031474	Don't be a damned fool! We know nothing of the viruses or bacteria that survive down here! We experiment to prepare. We prepare to survive.
FO300031475	What's the matter, teacher's pet? Gonna cry? Awww... Waaahh! Go run home to daddy.
FO300031476	No, but close. Not 45, 55. You've got to carry the 1, right? So you put the 5 there… and the one goes over there. See? Easy.
FO300031477	Yes, and Amata can come over after you clean your room! Now move! This place is disgusting.
FO300031478	What is their problem, anyway? So I'm the Overseer's daughter? So what? Like I get any kind of special treatment! At least… at least I've got you.
FO300031479	That was amazing, sport! Four strike outs in a row! I'll tell ya doc, I think we're looking at the new Vault 101 MVP!
FO300031480	Revelation, 21:6. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
FO300031481	Come on, doc. Just one more month, that's all I'm asking for. Without those pills, I… I just don't know what I'll do. Please, I'm begging you.
FO300031482	It's time for you to go home. Tell your father I want to see him in my office first thing in the morning. Amata, I want to talk to you. Now.
FO300031483	No, Mister DeLoria, that is not correct. The Battle of Hastings was 1066. 2077 was the end of the world. Tell me. Are you really that stupid?
FO300031484	Stop fussing! You look great! Now go! You want to be late for you own prom?
FO300031485	Don't give me that! You were drunk! All of you! What if I hadn't walked in? Hmm? Did you think about that? What if the Overseer found you first?
FO300031486	Well that's my job, isn't it? To turn you into a grown-up? Make sure you're ready to handle adult life here in the vault? You're not a kid anymore.
FO300031487	Oh my God. Please, doctor. Please! I know you have stuff here. Drugs! You have to fix this! My God, I can't be pregnant…
FO300031488	Ha ha! Look at that! What'd I tell you, huh? Work hard enough, and anything is possible. Even an "A" from Mister Brotch! Ha ha ha ha ha!
FO300031489	Yeah? Well daddy doctor ain't here to save you now, is he? So what you gonna do now, huh? What you gonna do?
FO300031490	What are you looking at? Stop gawking and get back to work. Selfish and insubordinate, just like your father…

FO300031500	Yeah. That's what I thought.
FO300031501	On second thought, stay with me.
FO300031502	Very well.
FO300031503	No, I'm not. Stay here.
FO300031504	I was worried for a second.
FO300031505	On second thought, stay with me.
FO300031506	<pant> <pant>
FO300031507	On second thought, stay with me.
FO300031508	FollowersFiredYes
FO300031509	I'm serious.
FO300031510	Very well. Although you remain my employer until my contract changes hands. I will wait for you in Underworld, should you need me again.
FO300031511	Do I look like I'm kidding?
FO300031512	If that's the way you're going to play, lover. I'll be waiting at Eulogy's place when you come crawling back.
FO300031513	Because I say so. Go.
FO300031514	<whimper>
FO300031515	You heard me. Get out of here.
FO300031516	I see how it is: the old man can't keep up. Whatever. I'm gonna go see if there's anything left of Megaton.
FO300031517	Don't make me repeat myself.
FO300031518	I see how it is: the old man can't keep up. Whatever. I'll be at Moriarty's if you change your mind.
FO300031519	Don't make me repeat myself.
FO300031520	I'm disappointed, but I cannot say I'm surprised. If you change your mind, I shall be studying in the American History Museum, downtown.
FO300031521	Yes, I'm certain.
FO300031522	Leaving a soldier behind? Very bad form. Making base in Canterbury Commons for when you come to your senses, sir!
FO300031523	You didn't mishear me. Leave.
FO300031524	Very well. I shall return to my duties at the Citadel should you require my aid once again.
FO300031525	We must part ways, Paladin Cross.
FO300031526	I found Argyle. I'm afraid he's dead.
FO300031527	But thank you! Thank you for telling me. At least now I know. At least now the poor guy can catch a breather.
FO300031528	I’d like to return your kindness. Here, take this key. It unlocks my safe. Lots of stuff in there I'll never use again. My adventuring days are over.
FO300031529	Tell me about Argyle.
FO300031530	Argyle was my manservant! Ah, but that’s really just a fancy word for "the guy who saves my sorry skin on a regular occasion."
FO300031531	He was a Ghoul, you see. Been around since before the war. We met when I stole his girlfriend, back in ’41. We’d been best friends ever since.
FO300031532	We got separated, a long time ago, and never reunited. If you find Argyle out there, somewhere, you be sure and tell me! Okay?
FO300031533	You mentioned something about GNR?
FO300031534	Haven’t you ever heard the radio play? The Adventures of Herbert "Daring" Dashwood? That guy at the radio station put it together a few years ago.
FO300031535	I saw the Family's mark on the wall. What's up with that?
FO300031536	Since my parents were already dead, they drank their blood and left the mark on the wall. He didn't want Evan to suspect I had done it.
FO300031537	Let's talk about something else.
FO300031538	Yeah, okay.
FO300031539	Do you really believe in vampires?
FO300031540	I dunno. I really don't. I mean, I'm not totally dumb. I know they were in stories and all that.
FO300031541	But who knows, maybe Vance is right and vampires were just people like us who learned to control their hunger and drink only blood.
FO300031542	I mean, vampires are regarded as feared monsters instead of hunted animals like cannibals. It kinda makes sense.
FO300031543	Did you ever talk to your parents about it?
FO300031544	Lucy said Mom and Dad would never have understood. She told me to keep what I did a secret and that she'd try and help me.
FO300031545	Thanks to Lucy, she was able to stop that from ever happening again for years.
FO300031546	What did Lucy say she saw you do to that Wastelander?
FO300031547	When did you first discover you had the hunger?
FO300031548	I was about 10 years old and I was playing with Lucy down under the overpass. We loved throwing rocks in the water.
FO300031549	We saw some Wastelander trying to break open the Brahmin pens and steal one of them, so I ran over and told him to stop.
FO300031550	He just laughed and pushed me away. When I fell, suddenly my head started to hurt and my eyes got all blurry. It was almost like I blacked out.
FO300031551	Would you mind if I asked about your unusual hunger?
FO300031552	I suppose not.
FO300031553	No, thanks.
FO300031554	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
FO300031555	Can you heal my radiation?
FO300031556	Sure can. Quick and easy, only 100 caps.
FO300031557	Who the hell are you supposed to be?
FO300031558	My name's Ian West. And who the hell are YOU supposed to be?
FO300031559	Wait a second. I heard fighting. You're here to kill me aren't you?
FO300031560	Are you a prisoner here or something?
FO300031561	Wait a second. I heard fighting. You're here to kill me aren't you?
FO300031562	Wait a second. I heard fighting. You're here to kill me aren't you?
FO300031563	What the hell is your problem?
FO300031564	I can't believe this is happening again! All the people I care about always leave me!
FO300031565	Evan King probably sent you to look for me, didn't he!? Well you can tell him I'll never set foot in Arefu again. NEVER!
FO300031566	After what I did, he's the one that probably wants me dead.
FO300031567	I have no clue what you're talking about.
FO300031568	Evan King probably sent you to look for me, didn't he!? Well you can tell him I'll never set foot in Arefu again. NEVER!
FO300031569	After what I did, he's the one that probably wants me dead.
FO300031570	Calm down, Ian. Tell me everything from the beginning.
FO300031571	How the hell do you expect me to calm down? I can't believe this is happening again! All the people I care about always leave!
FO300031572	Evan King probably sent you to look for me, didn't he? Well you can tell him I'll never set foot in Arefu again. NEVER!
FO300031573	After what I did, he's the one that probably wants me dead.
FO300031574	Is there someplace I can sleep?
FO300031575	The common room is free, but the beds are lousy. It's on the midship deck. A big open room with lots of beds. You can't miss it.
FO300031576	If you want to sleep well rested, rent a room from Vera Weatherly. She's on the upper deck.
FO300031577	Let's trade.
FO300031578	Okay. Here's what I have. What do you have?
FO300031579	Okay.
FO300031580	This is all I have. I hope it's okay.
FO300031581	Well, this stuff is mostly crap. But whatever. Oh, and I found some weapons and armor, so I'll be trading in that. It's more useful anyway.
FO300031582	Alright. Let's see if we can't find something mutually agreeable.
FO300031583	Excellent!
FO300031584	I'm sure you'll find something agreeable.
FO300031585	What's with all the names? Bob, Herbert and Harold? I don't get it.
FO300031586	Okay, okay. Let me talk real careful for the slow folks.
FO300031587	I was once a man a long time ago named Harold. Something in me changed and a weird little tree started growing right out of my head.
FO300031588	It kept getting bigger until I ended up stuck inside. When people would ask about it, I decided to name it Bob. You know, like a friend or something.
FO300031589	Sometimes I call him Herbert instead of Bob, because I get bored and I think it's funny. So long story short, call me Harold!
FO300031590	I'm not a charity. You want to die, cough up some caps.
FO300031591	Well, I used to carry those pesky caps a long time ago, but I think my pockets are in those shrubs over yonder.
FO300031592	I'm pretty sure the caves below me are full of all kinds of nifty gizmos you could take on your way to my heart. Help yourself!
FO300031593	You're mostly a tree, right? Can't I just burn you down?
FO300031594	Oh, no no no no! Fire would be too painful for me and poor old Bob. Keep that stuff away from us!
FO300031595	We've been in here for 3 months now, and it's way better than it used to be. Who says kids can't take care of themselves?
FO300031596	Jason has done a really good job keeping everyone busy. He says if we want to survive, we need to work together, and work hard.
FO300031597	A few of the kids have started saying we're like a whole new city. A city of kids. They call it "Little Lamplight." It's so cool.
FO300031598	All of us voted, in secret, and tomorrow we're going to tell Jason that he's the city's first mayor! He's going to be so happy with us.
FO300031599	It's been almost two months, and we're all doing pretty good, even if we are all alone.
FO300031600	There's a door that leads to a Vault, right here in the caverns. Every day we bang and bang, but they won't let us in. We can hear them in there!
FO300031601	One time, a guy on the other side told us we were dead already. Fuck those grown ups. Fuck them all. We don't need them ever again.
FO300031602	A month ago, the big war came and everything was destroyed. Except us. We're still okay in these caves. Kind of.
FO300031603	Mrs. Delaney went out this morning to get help, and she never came back. The other adults never came back either. So now it's just us kids.
FO300031604	A lot of the others still cry every day. They're really scared. I'm not. There's nothing to be scared of, as long as we don't go outside.
FO300031605	Nobody else wants to be in charge, so I'm going to try. Most of the kids listen to me already, so it should be easy.
FO300031606	LamplightHolotape2
FO300031607	We're all okay. If you can call being stuck in a cave with 82 terrified kids okay. Alive, anyway. But I don't know what the hell we're going to do.
FO300031608	It's been 4 days. Claudia went out this morning to look around, and never came back. Then Mr. Cob went out to look for her, and HE never came back.
FO300031609	So now there's only me, two other teachers, two of the parents who were chaperoning, and a few of the cavern staff. And all these poor kids.
FO300031610	We've got enough food and water to last for awhile, I guess. But after that? I just don't know. We can't stay in here forever. Can we?
FO300031611	My name is Carrie Delaney. I teach fourth grade at the Early Dawn Elementary School, in Washington, D.C.
FO300031612	Yesterday, October 23, 2077, half the school went on a field trip to Lamplight Caverns. We were packing up to leave when… when everything went crazy.
FO300031613	When he came back in, he told us what he saw. Clouds. Mushroom clouds. It's finally happened. The end of the world.
FO300031614	Tell me about the Rebels.
FO300031615	I wouldn't call us "rebels." I mean, we don't agree with the Overseer, but we still love the Vault. We just want to try going outside, too.
FO300031616	The Overseer thinks he's in charge of us, just because it's his job? Well, nuts to that! We do what we want, and we want to open the Vault!
FO300031617	I hate that this whole thing has turned us against our families, but we just can't keep living down here forever. I mean, look at this place!
FO300031618	Most of them are just kids who're caught up in the idea of seeing the world. But I know we've got to actually open the Vault if we want to survive.
FO300031619	Otherwise, we're just going to dwindle away down here, until it's all too late.
FO300031620	Oh, dear, we aren't asking for anything special. The Vault's been open before, but for some reason, everyone tries to pretend it wasn't.
FO300031621	I guess they try to forget the poor souls who never came back from out there.
FO300031622	Tell me about the rebels.
FO300031623	They're a bunch of hellions, that's what they are. I'm at my wits' end about them, I really am.
FO300031624	Those kids are risking our entire Vault, just because they're bored. It's horrible!
FO300031625	It's just a phase they're going through. Every kid thinks they want to leave the Vault at some point, but we all grew out of it.
FO300031626	What do you expect from idiots like them? I'm just glad I was done with Butch's stupid gang before they got involved in all this.
FO300031627	More kids looking to get us all killed. Now it's up to security to keep them in line.
FO300031628	They don't know what they're doing, and it's up to us adults to keep them from getting everyone killed.
FO300031629	I expect as much from some of those idiot kids and batty old Palmer, but I expected more sense from Brotch.
FO300031630	I tell you, I'm scared of them. I never know when they're going to try something dangerous!
FO300031631	What happened down here?
FO300031632	It's all kind of blurry for me, but I hear I owe you for saving me. But don't expect much. The whole thing was your Dad's fault in the first place!
FO300031633	The bugs were horrible, but my family was pretty lucky. But then my Freddie went and got caught up with those idiot rebels!
FO300031634	With all of the bugs and the fires, there was an awful lot of strain on the systems down on the reactor level.
FO300031635	Our water chip's pretty delicate right now, but I'm working on setting her right again.
FO300031636	You shoulda seen my pop, he personally saved old Stanley! But  guess you wouldn't know what it's like to have a hero for a dad, would you?
FO300031637	After what happened to Vikki and my boy that night, your corpse should be strung up as a warning to anyone else thinks about heading outside.
FO300031638	Bugs. Fires. Confusion. Panic. What do you care? You and your dad started the whole mess.
FO300031639	We were so busy fighting those bugs, there wasn't anyone to help put out the fires that started after you left. It was horrible.
FO300031640	I lost my poor wife Agnes, is what happened. In all the chaos and fighting, her old ticker just couldn't take it anymore.
FO300031641	Mom and little Monica got caught in the fires. I tried to get them out, I really did, but it was just too hot.
FO300031642	I know it wasn't your fault, but my dad doesn't think as highly of you. You wouldn't want to hear what he said he'd do to your dad, either.
FO300031643	Paul got bit real bad by some of those Radroaches, but he thought he could tough it out. If we'd had a doctor to treat him, he might still be here.
FO300031644	A lot of security got wounded and worse. In all the confusion, we still don't know who's responsible for some of them.
FO300031645	It was pretty rough, I'll tell you. I know a lot of folks blame your dad, but I know he didn't mean to cause all that. Don't blame him, or yourself.
FO300031646	My poor grandson Jonas died, is what happened. They say it was just an accident in all the confusion, but I know it was the Overseer.
FO300031647	Where can I rent a bed?
FO300031648	Up at Moriarty's at the south end of town. Talk to Nova, she'll help you out.
FO300031649	I'm the one who saved the kids from Paradise Falls.
FO300031650	Oh yeah? Well why didn't you say so, you stupid mungo?
FO300031651	The ship's water isn't much better. If we don't get fresh water soon, we'll all end up like her.
FO300031652	Yeah. I heard she was drinking river water.
FO300031653	What can you tell me about Mabel Henderson?
FO300031654	I'm not really complaining. Last time we were over there, I bumped my head on that gigantic chandelier she has. Not anxious to do that again.
FO300031655	Roger and I don't spend much time with Mabel, frankly. She's a little nosey for my tastes. And I don't like visiting her house, either.
FO300031656	Mabel's been a good friend to me. She's always interested in what's going on with my life, which is more than I can say for some people.
FO300031657	She sure loves baking her pies. Always bringing them around, bragging about her fancy oven.
FO300031658	I'm not one to turn down a good pie, but it gets a bit tiresome hearing her go on and on.
FO300031659	Mabel? She's nice enough, I suppose. A bit of a gossip, maybe. And she never seemed too fond of my boy Timmy.
FO300031660	She was just complaining about his rollerskates the other day. Said Timmy left them in her house, and that they were dangerous.
FO300031661	If they're so dangerous, why didn't she just bring them here when she came to complain about it?
FO300031662	Fond of her gadgets, she is. Heck, I can't count the number of times I've had to fix that new-fangled robot of hers.
FO300031663	I keep telling her to order some new parts. The motivator goes bad on that one, and she's going to have a real problem on her hands.
FO300031664	Sorry, sounds like suicide. Be my guest.
FO300031665	I dunno why you bothered to come here and wake me then. I would have been better off sleeping through it.
FO300031666	Start from the beginning.
FO300031667	We were mapping the Vernon Square part of the downtown ruins and got jumped by a Super Mutant ambush party.
FO300031668	Usually it isn't a problem, but this group was bigger than usual. We fought our way into Our Lady of Hope Hospital, hoping to find cover.
FO300031669	Tell me what's going on and I'll see if I can help.
FO300031670	We were mapping the Vernon Square part of the downtown ruins and got jumped by a Super Mutant ambush party.
FO300031671	Usually it isn't a problem, but this group was bigger than usual. We fought our way into Our Lady of Hope Hospital, hoping to find cover.
FO300031672	They are?! Holy shit!
FO300031673	Look, either I need to get out there and lend them a hand or they aren't going to last much longer.
FO300031674	I saved the Vault, and now you're kicking me out?
FO300031675	No, it's not like that. But if you stay, it'll just keep causing more problems. The Vault can't take any more in-fighting. It's just what has to be.
FO300031676	It'll be a while before we're ready to really go outside. But once the Vault is stable again, maybe we'll see you out there.
FO300031677	So I guess this is goodbye for now. It's not much, but take this with you, to remember us by. With luck, we'll meet again.
FO300031678	I understand. Goodbye, Amata.
FO300031679	We can never really thank you enough for everything you've done. It's not much, but take this with you, to remember us by.
FO300031680	It'll be a while before we're actually ready to go outside. But once the Vault is stable again, maybe we'll see you out there.
FO300031681	So I guess this is goodbye for now. But with luck, we'll meet again.
FO300031682	Why don't you just forget about it and clear on out of here?
FO300031683	Look, my dad used to always say "You can do whatever you want in life but the family comes first."
FO300031684	If I left now, I'd just be running away. I can't do that. I owe him.
FO300031685	Look, anything else you can do to help might save lives.
FO300031686	You know, maybe this will help and maybe it won't, but pappa hid a bunch of stuff behind the old diner in a dumpster.
FO300031687	He trusted me with the key and said it was for emergencies, but I bet he wouldn't mind you having it.
FO300031688	Will's dad was scary? How so?
FO300031689	He was like always watching me and my dad real careful, like he didn't trust us or something.
FO300031690	He always kept staring at us from the windows of his house and typing stuff into his TV box.
FO300031691	Will said his dad was like an old soldier or something, but he didn't like doing that stuff so he quit.
FO300031692	How about Will's parents?
FO300031693	Well, his mom was nice too. She was kind of quiet, but she always took care of me and my pappa when we came over.
FO300031694	I think she was sad that my mom was gone.
FO300031695	So, you and Will were good friends?
FO300031696	Yeah, Will was super nice to me. He was like a year older than me I think. He even shared his comic books with me.
FO300031697	Where did the Brandices live?
FO300031698	Right across the street actually. It was pretty swell having someone to hang out with so close by.
FO300031699	Yeah?
FO300031700	Tell me about the Brandice Family.
FO300031701	Tell me about this "Doc Lesko."
FO300031702	He was a strange man. He paid pappa some caps to help him build a shack and carry a bunch of junk into it.
FO300031703	Pappa called him an egghead, but his head was shaped regular, so I didn't get it.
FO300031704	Mind if I ask about some of the people who lived here?
FO300031705	Naw, go ahead. It's just nice to talk to anyone about stuff at all.
FO300031706	<whistling>
FO300031707	I heard you bake really tasty pies. Can you make one for me?
FO300031708	Well sure I can, sweetie!
FO300031709	Let me just go light the oven to get it warming up.
FO300031710	The People's Republic of China claims this land as its own! Your evil, materialistic ways are at an end, American dogs! Men, open fire!
FO300031711	Dad? Is that really you?
FO300031712	<bark! bark!>
FO300031713	You want help? Fork over some caps, Einstein.
FO300031714	But I digress. If it's payment you need, all I can offer is one of my Mutagenic Bioenhancers.
FO300031715	Books aren't going to buy me new ammunition.
FO300031716	But I digress. If it's payment you need, all I can offer is one of my Mutagenic Bioenhancers.
FO300031717	Is there anyone on this ship named Pinkerton?
FO300031718	Now there's a name I haven't heard in a while.
FO300031719	Never met the man myself, but rumor has it he helped found Rivet City.
FO300031720	Some rumors say he died trying to loot the broken bow of the ship. Others say he joined up with the Enclave.
FO300031721	Is there anyone on this ship named Pinkerton?
FO300031722	You mean genius boy?
FO300031723	Yeah, I've heard of him. Supposedly built Rivet City. They probably think he invented bread too. Idiots.
FO300031724	Lately he's even been blamed for the noises in the broken ship bow. Anyone with half a brain would know that's just the Mirelurks.
FO300031725	You ever hear of a guy named Pinkerton?
FO300031726	Pinkerton, eh? That name takes me way back. Claimed to have cured radiation poisoning. Or was it food poisoning? I don't recall.
FO300031727	He was always telling folks that he founded Rivet City. All he did was break off the front of it. Or did he die there? I don't recall.
FO300031728	You know of someone named Pinkerton?
FO300031729	That idiot? He left so long ago, most folk don't even remember him.
FO300031730	He claimed to have found a secret stash of technology somewhere in the ship. Then he just disappeared.
FO300031731	You ever hear of someone named Pinkerton?
FO300031732	What a moron. Always going on about how he started Rivet City. Who gives a crap?
FO300031733	Right before he disappeared, he was going on about some new fangled contraption he was sure was in the broken bow of the ship.
FO300031734	I'm looking for someone named Pinkerton. Ring any bells?
FO300031735	Don't you believe the rumors. His ghost is certainly NOT haunting the bow of the ship. Now, if you'll excuse me. I have work to do.
FO300031736	I'm tracking down a guy named Pinkerton. Do you know where I can find him?
FO300031737	Are those rumors still floating around? Look, I don't have time for swapping ghost stories with you.
FO300031738	Pinkerton's a legend. Dead or long gone. Don't care much as I've got real people to take care of. Go bother someone else.
FO300031739	You know what, keep your caps and I'll tell Moriarty you're gone.
FO300031740	Thanks, kid. You watch yourself out there.
FO300031741	This is a hefty task, Doc. I'm going to need serious incentive.
FO300031742	Yes, I suppose you're right. Science must learn to acquiesce to your standards in order to advance itself.
FO300031743	I was merely going to offer one of my Mutagenic Bioenhancers, but I suppose I could up the ante.
FO300031744	So you want me to pop the Queen, huh?
FO300031745	Oh! No, no, no! The Queen mustn't be harmed at all! Months of work would be lost!
FO300031746	Your objective would be to eliminate what I call her quintet of Nest Guardians. Filthy little abominations!
FO300031747	Why not just kill the Queen and be done with it?
FO300031748	Your objective would be to eliminate what I call her quintet of Nest Guardians. Filthy little abominations!
FO300031749	If the Queen's your concern, why not deal with it directly?
FO300031750	If she were harmed in any way, months of data would be lost.
FO300031751	Your objective would be to eliminate what I call her quintet of Nest Guardians. Filthy little abominations!
FO300031752	So? It's your mistake Doc, you fix it.
FO300031753	Please, don't insult my intelligence. Had I been able to correct this error easily I would have done so long before you arrived.
FO300031754	My portable terminal is set up in the Hatchery Chamber near the Ant Queen. If I can reach it, I can continue to work on improving the mutagen.
FO300031755	What exactly do you need?
FO300031756	My portable terminal is set up in the Hatchery Chamber near the Ant Queen. If I can reach it, I can continue to work on improving the mutagen.
FO300031757	What can I do to help?
FO300031758	Since you've offered, allow me to elaborate.
FO300031759	My portable terminal is set up in the Hatchery Chamber near the Ant Queen. If I can reach it, I can continue to work on improving the mutagen.
FO300031760	FFEnclaveCamp08Report
FO300031761	Sir, I encountered three Ferals on my patrol.  This was somewhere around 0300 hours, I think, and it was dark, so they saw me first.
FO300031762	I discharged my firearm four times, fatally striking two of the three.  My weapon jammed before I could fire on the third target.
FO300031763	He actually followed me back on his own.  We put him in the trailer with the other and he's been quiet as you like.  Strangest thing I've ever seen.
FO300031764	Mutagenic Bio-what?
FO300031765	I've managed to isolate some of the Fire Ant genes and distill them into human-safe genetic enhancers!
FO300031766	I can inject you with one of these formulas and you'll find yourself with either enhanced strength or enhanced perception!
FO300031767	Not only that, but you'll be somewhat more resistant to fire! How marvelous!
FO300031768	This will stop the Fire Ants?
FO300031769	No, it should all wrap up rather nicely.  I've rigged my equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
FO300031770	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
FO300031771	So, that's all there is to it. What do you say?
FO300031772	No, it should all wrap up rather nicely.  I've rigged my equipment to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
FO300031773	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
FO300031774	However, there is one final detail I need your help with. Could you do something about Bryan Wilks for me?
FO300031775	I hope that's everything, I've had enough of ants.
FO300031776	Yes, it should all wrap up rather nicely. I've rigged my equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
FO300031777	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
FO300031778	So, that's all there is to it. What do you say?
FO300031779	That's everything to do with the ants, yes indeed. I've rigged my equipment to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
FO300031780	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
FO300031781	However, there is one final detail I need your help with. Could you do something about Bryan Wilks for me?
FO300031782	Just how will all this undo the mayhem you've caused?
FO300031783	I've rigged the equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
FO300031784	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
FO300031785	So, that's all there is to it. What do you say?
FO300031786	I've rigged the equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
FO300031787	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
FO300031788	However, there is one final detail I need your help with. Could you do something about Bryan Wilks for me?
FO300031789	Really?! Oh my gosh!
FO300031790	Well if anyone can stop the Fire Ants, it's you two together. You're both really smart!
FO300031791	Do you trust Lesko?
FO300031792	I dunno. I mean, he always talked real funny and didn't let me touch anything in his house.
FO300031793	But I guess he was okay. I mean, he never did anything bad.
FO300031794	Before Lesko showed up, were there ever ants in Grayditch?
FO300031795	It only started getting bad here with these Fire Ants after the Doc got here, yeah.
FO300031796	Did your pappa ever tell you what he thought of Lesko?
FO300031797	Well, I remember once they were all yelling at each other and stuff. Kinda weird cause Doc Lesko is so nice and all.
FO300031798	Later pappa said something like "The Doc has got a brain on his shoulders when it comes to ants, but he's got a lot to learn about people."
FO300031799	Mind if I ask you some important stuff about Doctor Lesko?
FO300031800	Naw, go ahead. I like talking to you.
FO300031801	Haven't found a thing. (Lie)
FO300031802	Awww shucks. Well, keep trying, mister. I promise I'll be good and stay right here for you.
FO300031803	Awww shucks. Well, keep trying, lady. I promise I'll be good and stay right here for you.
FO300031804	I know where the Ant Queen lives.
FO300031805	You do?!
FO300031806	Well, what are you waiting here for? Go back and kill that thing! Because of it, my pappa's dead! Hurry!
FO300031807	All the ants are dead so I'm done here. Go home.
FO300031808	I wish I had something to give you for all the work you did, but I never really had much to start with.
FO300031809	I guess now you'll be on your way and I'll have to try living here by myself. I hope you'll come back and visit someday.
FO300031810	It's a slave collar, I sold your dumb ass for caps.
FO300031811	You son-of-a-bitch!!!!
FO300031812	How could you do this to me? I lost everything and you sell me to slavers? Well fuck you!
FO300031813	Something to remember me by. It'll lead you home.
FO300031814	I can't believe everything you've done for me. Most people would have kept on walking when I ran up to them screaming like I did.
FO300031815	I'll get my stuff together and move on out there right away. Come visit me sometime!
FO300031816	It's a Paradise Welcome Necklace. It'll help you find your way, you lucky devil!
FO300031817	I can't believe everything you've done for me. Most people would have kept on walking when I ran up to them screaming like I did.
FO300031818	I'll get my stuff together and move on out there right away. Come visit me sometime!
FO300031819	Sure did. It's a beautiful place called Paradise Falls. Here, put this on.
FO300031820	W-what is this weird thing?
FO300031821	I found a place with lots of kids your age. I'll tell you how to get there.
FO300031822	Well, it would have been nicer to live with Vera, but this will probably be pretty fun too!
FO300031823	I can't believe everything you've done for me. Most people would have kept on walking when I ran up to them screaming like I did.
FO300031824	I'll get my stuff together and move on out there right away. Come visit me sometime!
FO300031825	I sure did, Bryan. Vera said she'd take you in!
FO300031826	You really found her!? Oh, thank you so much!
FO300031827	I can't believe everything you've done for me. Most people would have kept on walking when I ran up to them screaming like I did.
FO300031828	I'll get my stuff together and move on out there right away. Come visit me sometime!
FO300031829	Actually, I give up. I can't find anywhere that will take you in.
FO300031830	Oh, okay. I understand. Thanks for trying though.
FO300031831	Stop by again someday and say hi, okay?
FO300031832	Actually, I'm not ready yet.
FO300031833	Very well. Return to me when you're ready.
FO300031834	I'd like the Ant Sight to increase my perception.
FO300031835	How marvelous! Ant Sight it is! Hold still please.
FO300031836	I'd like the Ant Might to increase my physical strength.
FO300031837	How marvelous! Ant Might it is! Hold still please.
FO300031838	I'm ready for my Mutagenic Bioenhancer injection and Lab Coat, Doctor.
FO300031839	How marvelous! Here is the promised Lab Coat. I'm certain you'll find it quite useful.
FO300031840	Which injection did you want? Will it be the Ant Sight or Ant Might?
FO300031841	How marvelous! Which injection did you want? Will it be the Ant Sight or Ant Might?
FO300031842	I'm ready for my Mutagenic Bioenhancer injection, Doctor.
FO300031843	You didn't honor the agreement, so our bargain is null and void. Good day.
FO300031844	What about my payment?
FO300031845	Your theories were in error, and beyond correction. I had no choice.
FO300031846	Spoken like a true disciple of science! I will restart my calculations from the beginning and learn to crawl before I try to run.
FO300031847	I suppose I shouldn't be angered by your actions, forgive my impertinance.
FO300031848	Because you're out of your mind!
FO300031849	I'm afraid I have no further use of your services and any bargain we may have had is null and void!
FO300031850	I can't let you risk people's lives for an experiment.
FO300031851	I'm afraid I have no further use of your services and any bargain we may have had is null and void!
FO300031852	It was for the greater good Lesko. Man is not ready to play God.
FO300031853	Perhaps man isn't ready, my friend. Not today, but maybe someday.
FO300031854	I suppose I shouldn't be angered by your actions, forgive my impertinance.
FO300031855	I've killed the Ant Queen and I destroyed your mutagen supply.
FO300031856	Destroying the mutagen was NOT part of what we discussed!
FO300031857	I've killed all of the Nest Guardians, but I destroyed your mutagen supply.
FO300031858	What?!! How could you do such a foolish thing?
FO300031859	Oh now this is really too much!
FO300031860	I don't have time for these kinds of shenanigans. Allow me to return to my work and you return to the job at hand!
FO300031861	I've killed all the Nest Guardians [Lie]
FO300031862	Then I will proceed to my portable terminal at once and make the necessary changes to the formula.
FO300031863	Let's proceed to my terminal and we'll see if I can undo all the damage I've caused.
FO300031864	My work is done, Doctor.
FO300031865	Oh, how marvelous! Please, tell me what happened.
FO300031866	Oh, how marvelous! Please, tell me what happened.
FO300031867	Please, don't insult my intelligence. You didn't even enter the Hatchery!
FO300031868	Now, I believe you have a job to do?
FO300031869	I've killed all the Nest Guardians.
FO300031870	Then I will proceed to my portable terminal at once and make the necessary changes to the formula.
FO300031871	What kind of work do you do in here?
FO300031872	Hmph. I'm the guy that got Rivet City up and running in the first place!
FO300031873	What are you doing here in this wrecked part of the ship?
FO300031874	I live here. It's where I do my work. And it's FAR away from Dr. Li and all those other monkeys dressed up like scientists.
FO300031875	You made it past my defenses, which proves you aren't a dummy. AND you haven't killed me, so I suppose you aren't here to do that.
FO300031876	I suppose you can hang around if you want. Just don't touch anything.
FO300031877	I’m sorry about this, I really am. But it’s true. You’re not human.
FO300031878	I'll admit, this is pretty convincing evidence, but it doesn't make any sense. How can this be possible?
FO300031879	You were made to look and act human. But you’re not. The evidence proves that.
FO300031880	I'll admit, this is pretty convincing evidence, but it doesn't make any sense. How can this be possible?
FO300031881	It’s not real blood, Harkness. It’s synthetic, just like everything else.
FO300031882	I'll admit, this is pretty convincing evidence, but it doesn't make any sense. How can this be possible?
FO300031883	I need to know more about what I'm dealing with. What is an android exactly?
FO300031884	Forget everything you know about robots. Those buckets are mere children's toys compared to the real thing.
FO300031885	Androids have fake skin, and blood, and are programmed to simulate human behavior, like breathing. They can even eat and digest food realistically.
FO300031886	So tell me about the Commonwealth.
FO300031887	Uh oh. Wait here. This doesn't look good.
FO300031888	Holy crap, you're crazy!
FO300031889	That's it, old man! We're opening that door, and to hell with the Overseer's rules!
FO300031890	You know I can't do that, Freddie. Now get back down below, before I have to do something we'll both regret.
FO300031891	What, you're gonna lock me up like you did to Brotch? You can't cage a Tunnel Snake, man! Because we rule!
FO300031892	Stay back!
FO300031893	FortIndReport02
FO300031894	Defender Morgan and I executed a reconnaissance mission last night to gauge Raider entrenchment in the structural underground of Fairfax.
FO300031895	We located three entrances into underground utility tunnels, and confirmed the enemy has occupied and fortified these positions. Some are undefended.
FO300031896	We also identified a small weapons cache in the southeast section of the tunnels. We were compromised by a patrol while placing explosives here.
FO300031897	In accordance to mission parameters, we did not engage, instead retreating to Base.  Raiders will be likely to attach more patrols to that area now.
FO300031898	FortIndReport01
FO300031899	We've secured the building and are currently implementing our orders for the occupation of Fairfax.
FO300031900	Raider activity in town has increased since we first took up positions in and around the fort.  We've killed a lot of them and scared off others.
FO300031901	But they just keep coming back. Their numbers seem limitless, while requests for our own reinforcements are repeatedly denied.
FO300031902	That the Raiders take such continued risks to invade our facility appears to confirm suspicions that we've had an intelligence leak.
FO300031903	They've tried tenaciously to infiltrate the base, but so far haven't stood a chance.  Our objective remains the same: protect the research personnel.
FO300031904	I got my own problems right now, kid.
FO300031905	Why are you so mean!?
FO300031906	I knew grown-ups were stupid! All you care about is yourself! Well, fine!
FO300031907	Sorry, kid. Help costs caps, and you look pretty broke to me.
FO300031908	Look, I know if you find my pappa he's gotta have some caps with him. He'd pay you! Please, mister!
FO300031909	Look, I know if you find my pappa he's gotta have some caps with him. He'd pay you! Please, mister!
FO300031910	If you're talking about the Fire Ants, I'm already working on it.
FO300031911	You-you are?! I can't believe it!
FO300031912	But what about pappa?! I need you to find my pappa!
FO300031913	You-you are?! I can't believe it!
FO300031914	But what about pappa?! I need you to find my pappa!
FO300031915	That's wonderful, kid. Now scram.
FO300031916	Awww, come on. You're pretty tough taking out all those ants by yourself!
FO300031917	The name's Bryan Wilks, by the way, I live in Grayditch. Well, that is, I did until those Fire Ants turned this place into a cemetery.
FO300031918	Calm down, calm down. Just who the heck are you?
FO300031919	My name's Bryan Wilks. I live in Grayditch. Well, that is, I did until those Fire Ants turned this place into a cemetery.
FO300031920	I'm glad those stupid things are all dead though! You're pretty tough!
FO300031921	Hey, are you okay? You shouldn't be alone in a place like this.
FO300031922	My name's Bryan Wilks. I live in Grayditch. Well, that is, I did until those Fire Ants turned this place into a cemetery.
FO300031923	I'm glad those stupid things are all dead though! You're pretty tough!
FO300031924	Hold on. You're in the Tunnel Snakes? You guys really do rule!
FO300031925	You got that right.
FO300031926	Better not forget it, either.
FO300031927	What did you hear from the guards?
FO300031928	I heard one of the guards talking about some sort of plan to raid Amata and the rest of us.
FO300031929	I didn't hear anything else, but I think he read it on the security terminal, so maybe you can find more there. I'm sure it's bad news for us all.
FO300031930	MS16AtriumSceneGomez2
FO300031931	Taylor, stop shooting, damnit!
FO300031932	I didn't mean to fire, I really didn't. I just wanted to scare him off! But he had a knife! I can't be too careful with those rebels!
FO300031933	You almost shot Freddie!
FO300031934	I tell you, those guards are getting nastier every day. One of these days, it's gonna turn real ugly. But I'll be ready for it.
FO300031935	I can't believe they almost shot you!
FO300031936	Well, it's a dangerous place out there in the Wastes, right? People could really use a compilation of good advice. Like a Wasteland Survival Guide!
FO300031937	For that, I need an assistant to test my theories. I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt because of a mistake. Nobody's ever happy when that happens.
FO300031938	Sounds good. Tell me more.
FO300031939	Don't you get it? We don't want to abandon the Vault. We want to open it!
FO300031940	We still want this to be our home, but we want to get supplies from outside. Trading, exploring, anything's better than just hiding down here!
FO300031941	Why don't you just leave? There's not much security.
FO300031942	It's not that they want to leave. It's that they want to open the door and interact with the rest of the world. But that would risk the whole Vault.
FO300031943	Wait, why don't the rebels just leave?
FO300031944	MomHolotape
FO300031945	How the heck can an ant breathe fire?
FO300031946	The stimulation of the subject's evolutionary trigger by the mutagen caused a bio-defensive reaction metamorphosing the ant's venom glands.
FO300031947	This process caused unexpected oscillations in the venom molecules at such a vast rate it produces a thermodynamic biochemical reaction.
FO300031948	As the subject ejects the volatile solution, it becomes conflagrant due to new structures in it's maw I call its calefaction array.
FO300031949	Amazing, isn't it?
FO300031950	You should have at least told him you were alive. He thought he was alone.
FO300031951	I have no time for children and their petty games. What do they know about the importance of my work?
FO300031952	Don't you realize you've ruined his entire life?
FO300031953	You have your ideals and I have mine. I'm down here to complete my experiments at any cost.
FO300031954	If that means the loss of a few lives to save generations of lives in the future, it's a small price to pay.
FO300031955	Can't you take responsibility for his father's death?
FO300031956	All scientists take responsibility for their failures, because it comes with the territory.
FO300031957	I will take this experimentation to completion without roosting on the moral high ground.
FO300031958	If I allow emotions to enter the mix, all this time and energy spent will have been for nothing.
FO300031959	Who the hell is Bryan Wilks?
FO300031960	He's a rather bothersome young lad. Always asking interminable questions and interrupting my calculations.
FO300031961	After you're done down here, perhaps you can locate him on the surface and speak to him.
FO300031962	Wilks? I have no idea what you mean.
FO300031963	He's a rather bothersome young man. Always asking interminable questions and interrupting my calculations.
FO300031964	After you're done down here, perhaps you can speak to him and calm him down.
FO300031965	I'd be glad to help him. Who is he?
FO300031966	He's a rather bothersome young lad. Always asking interminable questions and interrupting my calculations.
FO300031967	After you're done down here, perhaps you can locate him on the surface and speak to him.
FO300031968	You've betrayed Doctor Li, and my father.
FO300031969	I'm sorry you see it that way. What are you going to do, kill me over it?
FO300031970	You should go. It sounds like you're in enough trouble as it is, and honestly I don't want anyone to see me talking to you.
FO300031971	Have you seen my dad?
FO300031972	Your dad? Nope, I haven't. Did he get lost?
FO300031973	He disappeared on you, huh? Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find him soon.
FO300031974	Your dad? No, I haven't. I'm sure he's around here somewhere.
FO300031975	I don't think so, but then I haven't really been looking for him. Sorry.
FO300031976	Oh he's here, you can be sure of that. Just don't expect to see what you're used to seeing.
FO300031977	No, I haven't. But when I do, I'll tell him you're looking for him.
FO300031978	Nope, 'fraid not. Don't you worry about it, though. You'll find him.
FO300031979	No sweetie, I haven't. I'm sure he'll come looking for you before long, though.
FO300031980	Can't say that I have, kiddo. Don't worry, I'm sure he'll turn up.
FO300031981	Tell me more about this place.
FO300031982	Maybe later. First I want to see how you get along with Timmy.
FO300031983	The details of this place are far beyond your comprehension, I'm sure.
FO300031984	Be content with what you need to know: This is a simulation, and I am in total control. If you wish to see the Vault again, you'll do as I say.
FO300031985	Who are you?
FO300031986	Don't you worry about that. You just go have fun with Timmy.
FO300031987	You know that I am Dr. Braun. Anything else is irrelevant. Perhaps you should be focusing your energy on what I've asked of you.
FO300031988	If you insist on an answer, then you may better know me as Dr. Stanislaus Braun.
FO300031989	What have you done with my father?
FO300031990	Oh, don't worry about that now. There are things to do!
FO300031991	Where is my father?
FO300031992	Have you met Doc the dog? He's another new arrival, much like yourself.
FO300031993	I just wanted to say thanks, and good luck.
FO300031994	Good luck? That's it? Fine. Thanks. Now let's get this over with.
FO300031995	I changed my mind. I'll do it. I'll put in the code.
FO300031996	Oh, no. We've done this once already. We don't have time to keep going back and forth.
FO300031997	Too many lives are at stake. We just stick with the plan.
FO300031998	Are you kidding me? We don't have time for this.
FO300031999	Fine. If you're going to do it, then do it. But hurry up.
FO300032000	Sorry, I didn't expect to bump into anyone alive down here.
FO300032001	That is precisely why this is the ideal place for my work.
FO300032002	Do you realize you're trampling about in a delicately balanced and highly sensitive experimentation area?
FO300032003	Hey, it's none of my business.
FO300032004	Damn right it's not. You were just leaving, weren't you, feeb?
FO300032005	What are you doing now?
FO300032006	I'm assisting Rothchild with some of his research. I've worked with portable generators more extensively than he has.
FO300032007	I don't really care for the idea that this is supporting some gigantic military robot, but given the state of things, I recognize the need for it.
FO300032008	Why do you think the Enclave attacked Project Purity?
FO300032009	I should think it's rather obvious. They want the technology for themselves.
FO300032010	You grew up in a Vault, never wanting for clean, fresh water. Out here in the real world it's hard to come by, and that makes it valuable.
FO300032011	Where can I buy more things for my place?
FO300032012	Yes, I believe this place could do with a bit more in the way of decoration.
FO300032013	Speak with Lydia Montenegro down in the Lobby Level of the tower. She has quite a selection of items to enhance your living space.
FO300032014	Yes, I believe this place could do with a bit more in the way of decoration.
FO300032015	Speak with Moira Brown at Craterside Supply here in Megaton. She has quite a selection of items to enhance your living space.
FO300032016	No, thanks.
FO300032017	Okay, but you're gonna kick yourself later!
FO300032018	Sure, I'll take it!
FO300032019	Here you go! Enjoy it!
FO300032020	I'll take it for 50 caps.
FO300032021	Well, it will save me the trip. Fine, you've got a deal. Enjoy!
FO300032022	You got any snake oil in there as well?
FO300032023	I promise you this is the real deal, my friend. For only 100 caps, you'd be one of two people in the Wasteland ever to drink one!
FO300032024	I usually sell them to a lady in Girdershade, she's just nuts about them.
FO300032025	How is it better than a regular Nuka-Cola?
FO300032026	For only 100 caps, you'll be the first to find out! I was on my way to Girdershade to sell it to the lady there, but you could save me the trip.
FO300032027	Shut up and make some sense!
FO300032028	Who's burning what?
FO300032029	Calm down! Let me try and help you.
FO300032030	The Wasteland is as dead as you're going to be if you don't tell me the truth!
FO300032031	Don't you see? The Great One has gifted us all! It's a second chance!
FO300032032	What are you, crazy or something?
FO300032033	I've seen the ground reaching to the sky with its outstretched arms. The Wasteland is reborn!
FO300032034	What is it? What did you see?
FO300032035	I saw life! Life is returning to the Wastes! The Great One brings it to all of us!
FO300032036	My mistake. I thought you were someone else.
FO300032037	Just keep on walking.
FO300032038	Life sucks, then you die. You may as well get that through your thick skull.
FO300032039	You may be right. Most people I meet seem to feel the same way.
FO300032040	I used to carry around much anger about my past, and fear about what would happen to me next.
FO300032041	But it became so heavy I was not able to take even a single step. So I had to put it all down.
FO300032042	It may be that I'm just not as strong as most people. I will have to think on these things.
FO300032043	Happy? Sure, I guess you could call it that.
FO300032044	I'm glad you are happy. That seems to me to be rather uncommon.
FO300032045	Many people I meet carry so much worry about the future and anger about the past I am surprised they can even move.
FO300032046	I will try to be more like you. Perhaps that is why our paths continue to cross. Thank you for sharing your happiness with me.
FO300032047	I've been worried about you. You don't exactly seem cut out for this place.
FO300032048	You've been worried about me? Oh, because of the trouble I ran into with the humans last time.
FO300032049	There is no point in carrying your worry around with you for so long. If I did that, I would never take one more step.
FO300032050	Now that's what I call payment.
FO300032051	You earned it. Rangers take care of their own. You watch your ass out here and come back alive!
FO300032052	Wow, thanks!
FO300032053	No problem. Once a Ranger, always a Ranger. Take care of yourself!
FO300032054	I don't know what to say. What do I owe ya?
FO300032055	Not a thing. Rangers take care of their own. You watch your ass out here and come back alive!
FO300032056	Nothing. That's not how it works. But maybe next time you'll think about helping out a fellow Ranger in trouble.
FO300032057	What are you doing, following me?
FO300032058	In a way. I tracked you using your Geomapper. Reilly sent me to find you so I could bring you this.
FO300032059	No problem. What are you doing out here?
FO300032060	Looking for you. I tracked you using your Geomapper. Reilly sent me to find you so I could bring you this.
FO300032061	Nice. So that's the thanks I get for coming all this way to bring you this?
FO300032062	Hey, you can't always count on me to save your ass.
FO300032063	Donovan! What are you doing in these parts?
FO300032064	Tracked you using the Geomapper. Reilly sent me to find you so I could bring you this.
FO300032065	Did you say a city of Ghouls?
FO300032066	Sure did. Underworld. It's right inside the Museum of History, then through the big skull.
FO300032067	Most of the residents ain't crazy about humans, but they'll sell to you, fix you up, so long as your caps are good. And you ain't a Ghoul hater.
FO300032068	"Other assholes"?
FO300032069	Yeah, you know. Those humans, like you. Well, maybe not like you, I dunno, but humans all the same.
FO300032070	Those other assholes.
FO300032071	Come on! Here you are in the Mall of our nation's fine capital, taking in the sights, visiting the monuments!
FO300032072	Face it. You're a tourist.
FO300032073	You're crazy to stand out here! Aren't you afraid of the Super Mutants?
FO300032074	My name's Willow, by the way.
FO300032075	What's with those things behind the glass?
FO300032076	The Glowing Ones? That's Ethyl. The other one is Meat. They used to be residents of Underworld.
FO300032077	Doctor Barrows is studying the link between normal Ghouls, Feral Ghouls, and Glowing Ones.
FO300032078	His research is truly fascinating.
FO300032079	Blessings to you, too. Surely, you would care to give a tithe for that wisdom?
FO300032080	Oh, yes, of course! Please, accept this. It's all I have, but surely I owe everything to the lessons in your holy guide. Bless you.
FO300032081	I never meant it like all that. It's just supposed to help you stay alive.
FO300032082	Yes, it teaches us how to live, and how to return to the paradise that was! Truly, it is our guide through this wasted land.
FO300032083	Please, take these as my thanks. So many of us owe our lives to your great work. Bless you.
FO300032084	No. Why don't you tell me about it? <Lie>
FO300032085	It's a glory of a book! It teaches us what to do, how to live, and how our people can return to the paradise that once was!
FO300032086	Read it? I helped write it!
FO300032087	Glory be! You're the great survivor!
FO300032088	Bless you, oh bless you for sharing your wisdom with mankind! You've given us all a chance to hope again!
FO300032089	You must be crazy. It's never a good day out here.
FO300032090	That's where you're wrong, my friend. I'm alive, I've got food, and humanity is hard at work surviving and rebuilding!
FO300032091	Haven't you heard the good news? Haven't you read the Wasteland Survival Guide?
FO300032092	Why are you so happy?
FO300032093	Why shouldn't I be? I've got food, I've got shelter, and I know humanity is on the rise again!
FO300032094	Haven't you heard the good news? Haven't you read the Wasteland Survival Guide?
FO300032095	Actually, I helped write that book.
FO300032096	Is that so? Well, thanks, stranger. You and that Moira girl done all right by me and mine. Nice writing!
FO300032097	Two meals a day doesn't sound like much.
FO300032098	Not to a fancy-pants like yourself, but it's a lot better than zero meals a day, and that was getting a might bit too common!
FO300032099	Now, excuse me, I best be getting back with this bounty of meat.
FO300032100	Oh, I am hunting. I'm hunting what you've got.
FO300032101	Too bad for you, I'm ready for your type, Raider!
FO300032102	Maybe the book's fine, and you're just an idiot.
FO300032103	Well, I'd have to be an idiot to listen to this piece of crap. Here, you think so much of it, you take it. Fat lot of good it'll do you.
FO300032104	I'm sorry to hear that. Is it really that bad?
FO300032105	Here, take a look. It's good for a laugh, but don't try to actually follow its advice. Not unless you're looking for a quick way to end it all.
FO300032106	Actually, I helped write that book.
FO300032107	Then I think you oughtta leave, before I decide to pay you back for all the bad advice. And take your damned book with you, too.
FO300032108	Book? What book?
FO300032109	Ain't you heard of the Wasteland Survival Guide? Bought one off a trader, and it's the reason my family's back up to two meals a day!
FO300032110	Just be glad you're still alive.
FO300032111	Yeah, and no thanks to this so-called Wasteland Survival Guide. It's a piece of crap, is what it is.
FO300032112	Serves me right for taking advice from some crazy girl's book.
FO300032113	What book?
FO300032114	This so-called Wasteland Survival Guide. It's a piece of crap, is what it is. Serves me right for taking advice from some crazy girl's book.
FO300032115	Sorry, miss, but we need to ask you a few questions.
FO300032116	We need to know where you got that suit.
FO300032117	I'm from Vault 101! Please, you've got to help me.
FO300032118	Of course. We are always ready to assist American citizens in distress. Can you tell us where your Vault is?
FO300032119	I've got the location right here on my Pip-Boy. Why?
FO300032120	Excellent. That's all we need from her. Open fire.
FO300032121	Fine, I like it better up here than I ever did down there.
FO300032122	Then I guess things worked out pretty well, huh? Take care of yourself out here. And thanks again - you've given the Vault a whole new life.
FO300032123	Well, don't let me hold you up.
FO300032124	Yeah, I guess I should be getting back. I'll tell Amata you're okay, she'll be happy to hear that.
FO300032125	Oh, and here: have some fresh water from the Vault. I guess it's pretty hard to find it out here. Take care out here, and thanks again.
FO300032126	I miss her, too. Give my warmest regards to the Vault, would you?
FO300032127	Oh, I will. They'll be glad to hear from you. Oh, and here: have some fresh water from the Vault.
FO300032128	I guess it's pretty hard to find it out here, and maybe it'll be a taste of home for you. Take care out here, and thanks again.
FO300032129	Doesn't really make a difference to me. I was exiled, remember?
FO300032130	I know. It's not fair, it really isn't, but it's just the way it has to be. I know Amata still misses you.
FO300032131	So, does that mean I can come back?
FO300032132	I'm sorry, but that still can't happen. As much as we owe you, there are still a lot of people who blame you for all the deaths.
FO300032133	It's not fair, I know, but it's the way it is. I know Amata still misses you.
FO300032134	I never expected to see you out here, either. I'm surprised you're alive.
FO300032135	Hey, you're not the only one who can get used to the outdoors, you know! The whole Vault's doing pretty well, as if you care.
FO300032136	Good to see you, Susie! Looks like you're doing well.
FO300032137	Thanks! The whole Vault's doing pretty well.
FO300032138	I'm just out taking care a little trading, now, but they've got the place in much better shape than when you left.
FO300032139	I've got to go now.
FO300032140	Come back and visit me some time.
FO300032141	You're obviously crazier than they are. Why would I listen to you?
FO300032142	I can't say I blame you. Its my mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
FO300032143	Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
FO300032144	What do you say Herbert, should I give them another chance?
FO300032145	Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
FO300032146	I'm not the killing type.
FO300032147	No, I suppose you aren't. My mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
FO300032148	Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
FO300032149	What do you say Herbert, should I give them another chance?
FO300032150	Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
FO300032151	You've become an important part of their life. Without you, they're lost.
FO300032152	So, they really need me that badly, huh? I guess I never thought of it that way. Awfully selfish of me.
FO300032153	Should we give them another chance, Herbert?
FO300032154	Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
FO300032155	Let's talk about something else.
FO300032156	Okay.
FO300032157	Which Treeminder do you get along with the best?
FO300032158	Actually, the kid is the nicest one of all. Yew's her name. She sneaks in here sometimes and just lets me talk about stuff I wanna talk about.
FO300032159	Bob really likes her too, cause she makes me happy.
FO300032160	How do the Treeminders normally handle other Outsiders?
FO300032161	Oh, you wouldn't believe how they handle them. They make them drink this gunk that Poplar makes.
FO300032162	Sometimes they just go nuts and start running around, and sometimes when they wake up and see me they run for the hills!
FO300032163	I'll tell you, Outsiders are almost as entertaining as the Treeminders!
FO300032164	Did you ever ask one of them to kill you?
FO300032165	They wouldn't listen to me at all! If I told them something simple, then it got done. Otherwise, Birch spent a week looking for a hidden meaning.
FO300032166	Plus, he used to just pop in whenever he wanted and started chanting this nonsense.
FO300032167	Sometimes I used to just sit there silently just to make him mad! That was fun for a while.
FO300032168	Had you ever asked one of them to kill you before?
FO300032169	They won't listen to me at all. If I tell them something simple, then it gets done. Otherwise, Birch spends a week looking for a hidden meaning.
FO300032170	Plus, he just pops in whenever he wants and starts chanting this nonsense.
FO300032171	Sometimes I just sit there silently just to make him mad. That was fun for a while, but even that's getting boring now.
FO300032172	Oh, don't get me started on them. I'm liable to talk about them all day! It even drives poor old Bob crazy.
FO300032173	Nevermind.
FO300032174	Let's go.
FO300032175	What is this place? Some kind of city?
FO300032176	It's Megaton. Have you been living in a hole or something? Everyone's heard of Megaton.
FO300032177	Timmy Neusbaum? Who's that?
FO300032178	Make him cry and then come back here so we can talk some more.
FO300032179	SuperJoke5
FO300032180	SuperJoke4
FO300032181	Kill the humans! Kill them all! Aggghhh!!
FO300032182	SuperJoke3
FO300032183	Humans who?
FO300032184	SuperJoke2
FO300032185	Humans.
FO300032186	SuperJoke1
FO300032187	Who there?
FO300032188	Do you sell any specialty items?
FO300032189	Do I ever! I've got the schematics for something called a Rock-It Launcher. I sell all the components, too, so you can make the weapon yourself.
FO300032190	In fact, if you ever need to make any custom weapons, feel free to use my workbench, here in the shop. All you need is the schematics and parts!
FO300032191	If this android "wandered" off, why would he want a new mind and face?
FO300032192	It's possible my android sought to forget his previous life. Wipe away all memory, all guilt. Trick himself into believing he really IS human.
FO300032193	So no, he may not be just an ordinary robot, but he's certainly not human, no matter how badly he wishes it so. I made him. I want him. End of story.
FO300032194	Why would an android feel guilt? Come on, Zimmer, what aren't you telling me?
FO300032195	By God, you're as annoying as you are clever. Very well. I'll tell you what you want to know, if it helps you locate my property.
FO300032196	The duty of this particular unit was the hunting and capturing of other escaped androids. Yes, others have escaped.
FO300032197	It's one of the side effects of having such an advanced A.I. Machines start to think for themselves. Fool themselves into believing they have rights.
FO300032198	Well, you found me. Now try and kill me, tough guy.
FO300032199	You!? You killed her!?
FO300032200	The Nuka-Cola Corporation had her killed! (Lie)
FO300032201	Crap! This has to be about the Nuka-Cola machine I got for her!
FO300032202	It had this label on it saying "Warning: If you tamper with this unit you will have to answer to the Nuka-Cola Corporation."
FO300032203	Now I bet they're after me! Oh god! I gotta hide. I gotta go!
FO300032204	Yeah, it's a shame. She was beautiful.
FO300032205	Wasn't she?
FO300032206	All I know is things are sure gonna be awfully quiet around here with her gone.
FO300032207	Ah well. I guess I'll go clean up the mess and take care of things around here.
FO300032208	Where was Vault 87 again?
FO300032209	Check the map in the lab for reference, if you like. The Vault is to the west of the city, far out in the Capital Wasteland.
FO300032210	Remember that you won't be able to just walk in, due to the radiation. You'll have to try and find another way to access the vault.
FO300032211	I expect that Lamplight Caverns is your best chance for success.
FO300032212	My father was looking for something called a G.E.C.K. Do you have one?
FO300032213	A G.E.C.K.? Goodness, no. Certainly not.
FO300032214	I must say that there are some who doubt such a device really exists, let alone works.
FO300032215	If, however, you share your father's determination, I may be able to assist you in locating one.
FO300032216	What the hell just happened?
FO300032217	There'll be more of them coming. We need to get out of here before they find us, or else your father died in vain.
FO300032218	The gate's open. Run for it!
FO300032219	What? No, I never said that.
FO300032220	Ain't got no use for one. Lost most of my hair a long time ago, y'see?
FO300032221	Ain't had enough to drink. Can't go nowheres.
FO300032222	Now's our chance! Let's go!
FO300032223	Freedom!
FO300032224	I'm interested in the Love Machine Theme.
FO300032225	Feeling a bit anxious, perhaps?
FO300032226	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300032227	Yuck, the thought of walking around naked's making me sick.
FO300032228	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300032229	I'm interested in the Love Machine Theme.
FO300032230	Feeling a bit anxious are we?
FO300032231	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
FO300032232	You're forcing me to do things against my nature, and I hate you for it.
FO300032233	I don't recall asking for your feelings on the matter.
FO300032234	If it has not been made perfectly clear to you, I am in control here. I dictate your actions, and the actions of those around you.
FO300032235	You will continue to do exactly as I say, or you will find yourself suffering from a sudden and inexplicable aneurysm.
FO300032236	And that's if I'm feeling generous.
FO300032237	For now, though, you will become the Pint-Sized Slasher. You will kill everyone in Tranquility Lane, and you will do this because I say so.
FO300032238	Behind the Abandoned House, in the dog house, are a knife and mask. You will use them to terrorize the residents of this quaint little street.
FO300032239	So it's not yours? Oops.
FO300032240	What is this doing here?
FO300032241	What am I supposed to be doing again?
FO300032242	Take on the role of the Pint-Sized Slasher, and kill everyone on Tranquility Lane. I'll be waiting.
FO300032243	Mabel Henderson needs to die. But in a creative, fun sort of way. I'm sure you'll think of something.
FO300032244	Visit the Rockwells. Observe their happy marriage, and then destroy it. But don't kill them; that'd spoil the fun.
FO300032245	You need to go find Timmy Neusbaum, and make him cry. It'll be funny. You'll see.
FO300032246	Zimmer thought you were an android. Don't worry, I set him straight.
FO300032247	The android is dead. See, here's an internal component. <Lie.>
FO300032248	Well. Here's 50 caps for your troubles. Try to buy yourself an education out here in this hell. Good day.
FO300032249	Look, Doctor Zimmer, we’ve been over this. We don’t know about your runaway robot, and we don’t care. This lab is dedicated to solving real problems.
FO300032250	Doctor Li is trying to save lives, and your constant interruptions are interfering with those efforts. Now please, stand aside!
FO300032251	You know, if you’re so smart, maybe you could help US? Hmm? But no, that never even crossed your mind. Go peddle your selfishness somewhere else.
FO300032252	Suit yourself.
FO300032253	Ignorance and facetiousness! That’s all you people are good for. Shiny paint job, indeed. You can’t even imagine the Commonwealth's accomplishments.
FO300032254	Fine. But I’m not leaving. Not until I’ve spoken to Doctor Li. I’ll be here when she’s ready to abandon her chemistry set and talk real science.
FO300032255	There's something you aren't telling me. Isn't there?
FO300032256	Oh, all right. So maybe I didn't wipe his mind, like he asked. But I buried it! Deep! Almost as good, really. But it's still there. Still accessible.
FO300032257	All you need to do is use the recall code. Just say to him, "Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet" and that will activate the hidden subroutines.
FO300032258	What if this evidence doesn't work? What if Harkness doesn't believe me?
FO300032259	Well, there is something else you could use. Look, I didn't really wipe his memories. Okay? I just sort of filed them away. But you can get 'em back.
FO300032260	All you need to do is use the recall code. Just say to him, "Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet" and that will activate the hidden subroutines.
FO300032261	Harkness should be told. You'd want to know if you were an android.
FO300032262	Maybe I am! Maybe I'm going to have my android army rise up against you and your human ilk!
FO300032263	I suppose you're right. But don't worry, I didn't really wipe his memories. I just buried them. But you can get them back.
FO300032264	All you need to do is use the recall code. Just say to him, "Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet" and that will activate the hidden subroutines.
FO300032265	Sorry Harkness, but this is the only way. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
FO300032266	Agggggghh!!!
FO300032267	Welcome back to reality, you filthy android. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
FO300032268	Agggggghh!!!
FO300032269	What do you know about the Commonwealth?
FO300032270	Most of it's a blasted nothing, just like here. But there's talk. Rumors, mostly. About a place called the Institute.
FO300032271	That's where Zimmer and that android came from. God knows what else they got goin' on in there, but it puts our tech to shame, that's for damn sure.
FO300032272	What do you know about this android Railroad?
FO300032273	Bunch of bleeding heart morons if you ask me. They're going to get themselves killed one of these days. And for what? Machine liberation?
FO300032274	But, they have brought me some really interesting tech over the years, so I guess they're okay. And that android! He was the chance of a lifetime.
FO300032275	So why'd you help the android?
FO300032276	Ha! Why do you think? I wanted to crack open that Commonwealth can opener to see what was inside.
FO300032277	There's stuff in there I'd only heard about, and even then I didn't believe it. I can see why that Zimmer feller wanted him back so bad.
FO300032278	So what do I call you, now? Harkness or A3-21?
FO300032279	In fact, for everyone's sake, let's just pretend I've always been Harkness. We'll keep the truth a little secret between friends. All right?
FO300032280	But I'm choosing to be human. It's my choice. The people on this boat look to me to protect them. So that's what I'm going to do.
FO300032281	So why did you do go ahead with the change? Was it worth it?
FO300032282	We deserve lives of our own. So that's what I did. I chose a new life, and gave up my old one. And now you've given me both to remember.
FO300032283	CitTalkAtEase.
FO300032284	At ease.
FO300032285	It is, Scribe Peabody. Thank you.
FO300032286	Indeed it does, Scribe Bowditch.
FO300032287	As you were.
FO300032288	Hail.
FO300032289	If I help you, is there some kind of reward?
FO300032290	Of course! If you help me, and thus the android, God and the universe will smile upon you. Is there any better compensation?
FO300032291	Anything else I should know?
FO300032292	Just understand that this android is now, for all intents and purposes, a man. He looks human, he acts human. He believes he IS human.
FO300032293	Can I join the Railroad?
FO300032294	Tell you what. You deliver that component to Zimmer and tell him the android is dead, and you can consider yourself a member in good standing.
FO300032295	What about human slaves? Don't you try to help them, too?
FO300032296	Yes, if we are able. But there are others in the Wasteland who assist in the plight of human slaves. Our android brethren have only us.
FO300032297	What's this "movement" you mentioned?
FO300032298	We call ourselves the Railroad. Our mission is the rescue and salvation of synthetic humanoids. Androids, as they're more commonly known.
FO300032299	This conversation's over, Ms. Watts. Now step aside.
FO300032300	Fine. Blow me off. Live in denial. But take this. It's an internal component from the very android you're searching for.
FO300032301	Don't ask how I obtained it. If you change your mind, if you decide you want to help, present the component to Doctor Zimmer in Rivet City.
FO300032302	Tell him the android is dead, and that was on the corpse. He'll believe you. He'll go back to the Commonwealth, and you'll have saved a man's life.
FO300032303	What would you have me do?
FO300032304	You really want to help? Take this. It's an internal component from the very android you're searching for. Don't ask how I obtained it.
FO300032305	Present it to Doctor Zimmer in Rivet City. Tell him the android is dead, and that was on the corpse. He'll believe you.
FO300032306	Do that, and Zimmer will go back to the Commonwealth, and leave that poor soul alone. Do that, and you'll have saved a man's life.
FO300032307	What I do with my own time is my own goddamn business.
FO300032308	Don't you realize what you're doing? The path you're on has the potential to ruin a man's life. Is that what you really want?
FO300032309	Look, whoever this missing android is, I just want to help. Okay?
FO300032310	Am I? You haven't talked to someone lately about a missing android? Or nosed around and found some information you should have left buried?
FO300032311	Who the hell are you?
FO300032312	Fine, let's cut to the chase. My name is Victoria Watts. I work for a movement whose goals are directly opposed to your own, apparently.
FO300032313	It seems you're trying very hard to locate an android my associates and I have tried very hard to hide. You can see how that puts us at odds.
FO300032314	PlayerDyingBreathEndgame
FO300032315	MQ04MabelRadio
FO300032316	Oh, dear. Is that old radio on the fritz again? I should turn it off.
FO300032317	I can't wait. What do you want me to do?
FO300032318	Your enthusiasm is inspiring. It's a shame you didn't arrive earlier.
FO300032319	Now, you will become the Pint-Sized Slasher, and kill everyone in Tranquility Lane.
FO300032320	Behind the Abandoned house, there is a dog house. Inside that dog house are the knife and mask you will take up.
FO300032321	LLPrincessVictorious
FO300032322	Ha ha! Now, scram!
FO300032323	Yeah, run along and cry now!
FO300032324	LLPrincessAngry
FO300032325	Get out of here, dummy!
FO300032326	Damnit, Lucy! Leave me alone!
FO300032327	Get out of here, you jerk!
FO300032328	Shut up before I pound you!
FO300032329	Among other reasons, I'm not a mean bitch like you. No, I'm a mean bastard! There's a difference!
FO300032330	Whoops, didn't mean to bug you, Miss Pwincess. Sowwy.
FO300032331	Didn't mean to bother you, Princess.
FO300032332	Sorry, Princess. Don't hurt me!
FO300032333	Nothing, I guess.
FO300032334	I guess I got lots of reasons. I mean, I'm alive, and we've got food and shelter, and I found this awesome rock yesterday!
FO300032335	Because I know if you keep on bullying people, I can always pee on your cave fungus and you'll never know.
FO300032336	Sorry, Miss Princess. Please don't get angry at me, okay?
FO300032337	Oh, probably because MacCready likes me more than he likes you. That seems like a good reason to me!
FO300032338	LLWhatsUp2
FO300032339	You know, the usual.
FO300032340	Not much, I guess. Apart from keeping you dumbasses in line, that is.
FO300032341	Just talking to morons who keep bugging me. Scram!
FO300032342	Fun times and laughs as always!
FO300032343	Cool junk and collecting, as always!
FO300032344	I was running so fast, I thought my legs were gonna fly off, but then they didn't, which makes sense, 'cause legs don't have wings. You know?
FO300032345	Just relaxing. Nothing much.
FO300032346	Nothing.
FO300032347	Just playing around, you know?
FO300032348	Keeping everyone from killing themselves. Same as ever.
FO300032349	Watching after the younger kids and seeing if they can't accidentally learn a thing or two. You know how it goes.
FO300032350	Not much. Still trying to find a way to turn this fungus into something that doesn't taste like toenails.
FO300032351	I got a new tooth today! It was just lying there and now it's mine!
FO300032352	Not much.
FO300032353	LLWhatsUp1
FO300032354	What's up, pal?
FO300032355	What's happening, pal?
FO300032356	Hewwo. What's up?
FO300032357	Hello, there. What're you up to? Not getting into too much trouble?
FO300032358	Hello. What's happening today?
FO300032359	What're you up to, today?
FO300032360	Hello. What's happening?
FO300032361	Hrmf. What have you got to be happy about?
FO300032362	Oh hey! What's happening? Something fun?
FO300032363	Hello. Anything interesting happening?
FO300032364	Hello. What's up?
FO300032365	Hey, what's happening?
FO300032366	Everything fine down here in paradise? What's happening?
FO300032367	Hey, what's up?
FO300032368	Sure, here you go and you don't owe me a single cap.
FO300032369	Well, that's awfully generous of you seeing as I never made a deal with you in the first place.
FO300032370	But I guess it's pretty decent of you not to sell it to someone else instead. Thanks, kid.
FO300032371	Fine, fine. Anything to get it! Here's your caps, now hand it over.
FO300032372	Nope, sorry. I'm holding onto it.
FO300032373	Fine, be an asshole. When you get hungry for caps, you know who to talk to.
FO300032374	I'm not giving you anything.
FO300032375	Fine. How about I pay you 200 caps for it? It's the same money I would have paid Grady.
FO300032376	Hang on a second. You want it, you need to pay for it.
FO300032377	Shrewd kid, very shrewd.
FO300032378	Okay. Seeing as I was going to pay Grady anyway, here's the caps I owed him. Now, lemme have it.
FO300032379	Sure, here you go.
FO300032380	Hey, thanks a bunch for bringing it to me. You could have been a jerk and sold it to someone else, but you didn't.
FO300032381	Ah hell, let me give you the rest of the caps I was gonna give Grady anyway.
FO300032382	I bumped into him a while back is all. (Lie)
FO300032383	You did huh? Well, if you ever see that lowlife again, tell him Ronald wants his damn package delivered or bring me back my caps.
FO300032384	I found him dead.
FO300032385	Holy crap! That son-of-a-bitch took my caps and ran and now he ends up dead?
FO300032386	Now I'll never get that package!
FO300032387	I have a package for you from him.
FO300032388	Holy crap! You have it?
FO300032389	Well hand it over! I've been waiting over a year for that damn thing!
FO300032390	Do you know someone named Grady?
FO300032391	Grady? Maybe. Why you asking?
FO300032392	Nope! Sorry!
FO300032393	If you're listening to this tape, then my brains are splattered all over a wall somewhere and you've got a job to do.
FO300032394	You need to retrieve the package and get it safely to Ronald Laren in Girdershade. Tell him Grady sent you.
FO300032395	To get the package, you'll need the key. I've stashed it inside an old fire hose case in some maintenance closet in Marigold Metro Station.
FO300032396	Good luck, and hopefully they won't find you too.
FO300032397	I'm keeping it, and I'd advise you to back off before I get angry!
FO300032398	All right, all right. My mistake. It obviously belongs to you.
FO300032399	Come and get it from me, if you think you can.
FO300032400	That was probably the dumbest thing you could have said. Fine, have it your way.
FO300032401	No way, it's mine!
FO300032402	I warned you, I was only going to ask once. Now I'm gonna take it from you!
FO300032403	How about you pay me for it?
FO300032404	I warned you, I was only going to ask once. Now I'm gonna take it from you!
FO300032405	Yeah. That's what I thought. Now scram!
FO300032406	Yes, I'm sure he's fine. No doubt when you leave the simulation, he'll be waiting for you.
FO300032407	Isn't it obvious? You've run the failsafe, disrupted everything. I have no power over you.
FO300032408	There's the door. Go.
FO300032409	Tell me about the G.E.C.K.
FO300032410	The Garden of Eden Creation Kit. It was for terraforming, for restoring the world after a nuclear disaster.
FO300032411	Unstable technology, and ultimately boring. Why re-make the old reality, when instead you could create any reality you choose?
FO300032412	Tell me exactly who you are. Who you really are.
FO300032413	And that now I'm trapped here, and it's all your fault.
FO300032414	My name is Stanislaus Braun. I am a Vault-Tec scientist. I created this simulation for Vault-Tec, but for myself as well.
FO300032415	It was my own design, my own perfection. A better reality than any other. Far greater than my work on the G.E.C.K.
FO300032416	Tell me about this place, about Tranquility Lane.
FO300032417	You know enough. You know this was my perfect simulation, my exquisite creation.
FO300032418	And now you've ruined it forever.
FO300032419	It is my greatest achievement. The best of the many simulations I've run in these 200 years.
FO300032420	I played with the others, but they bored me. This version never grew old. It amused me over, and over, and over again.
FO300032421	I came here for my father. Now where is he?
FO300032422	He's been right here the whole time, and you were too dense to figure it out. The dog, you see.
FO300032423	You'll just reset everything anyway. Who cares?
FO300032424	I CAN'T reset it, don't you see? The failsafe disabled the security protocols. They're all dead. For good!
FO300032425	It's all over. Now shut up, and answer my questions.
FO300032426	I just want things to go back the way they were.
FO300032427	I'm calling the shots now!
FO300032428	Are you kidding? If you get out, you can have all the booze you want!
FO300032429	You're hopeless. Forget it.
FO300032430	Forget what?
FO300032431	What's the deal with Barrett?
FO300032432	He's my assistant and my backup. In case things get rough. I wouldn't mess with him if I were you.
FO300032433	Can I buy some Ultrajet?
FO300032434	Hmmm, so you wanna live life on the wild side, huh? Okay. Go for it.
FO300032435	Yeah, as soon as you bring me some more Sugar Bombs.
FO300032436	Have you ever heard of The Family?
FO300032437	Sure. I stay away from them and they don't bother me. It's a good relationship. They live somewhere East of here.
FO300032438	If you're feeling foolish, I think there's an underground way through to their place deeper in the metro station here.
FO300032439	Here's all the Sugar Bombs I've got.
FO300032440	Nice work. The Ultrajet's coming along nicely.
FO300032441	Excellent! keep it coming.
FO300032442	Let me think about it a bit.
FO300032443	What is it with you people? Stop thinking so much. That's what got us all here in the first place.
FO300032444	Make it 30 caps each and you got yourself a deal.
FO300032445	Fine, anything to get what I need. Now scram, I got some preparing to do!
FO300032446	Good. Now get going, I have a ton of preparation to do.
FO300032447	No way. I'm not helping you make chems!
FO300032448	Fine, fine. Sheesh. Take it easy. You change your mind, gimme a shout.
FO300032449	Nothing's free in this world, Murphy.
FO300032450	Yeah, no kidding. I didn't think you were a freakin' charity.
FO300032451	It takes 3 things to make Ultrajet. Two of the ingredients I got plenty of. The other one is a little harder to find: Sugar Bombs.
FO300032452	For every box of Sugar Bombs you bring me, I'll pay you 15 caps. So you in?
FO300032453	That's it, Butch. You and me. Right now.
FO300032454	You've got to be kidding me.
FO300032455	Come on Tunnel Snakes, this twerp needs another lesson.
FO300032456	Yeah sure, what do you need?
FO300032457	It takes 3 things to make Ultrajet. Two of the ingredients I got plenty of. The other one is a little harder to find: Sugar Bombs.
FO300032458	For every box of Sugar Bombs you bring me, I'll pay you 15 caps. So you in?
FO300032459	Stop trying to talk your way out of this, zombie!
FO300032460	What the heck are you talking about?
FO300032461	Only trouble is it's almost impossible to gather the ingredients together.
FO300032462	Say, you might be able to help me with that!
FO300032463	Ultrajet? That some sort of super chem?
FO300032464	Only trouble is it's almost impossible to gather the ingredients together.
FO300032465	Say, you might be able to help me with that!
FO300032466	Yeah sure, I'm here for everything you got. Hand it over, zombie!
FO300032467	No! No way! You're not taking the formula from me!
FO300032468	What secrets?
FO300032469	The secret of making Ultrajet obviously!
FO300032470	Oh dammit, now the cat's out of the bag. Typical me.
FO300032471	Steal your secrets? Not at all.
FO300032472	Good. I was afraid I was gonna have to abandon my lab here. That would mean starting all over again.
FO300032473	It's not easy trying to make Ultrajet you know!
FO300032474	Not now. I'm busy
FO300032475	Suit yourself.
FO300032476	Nothing much. One of the littler kids had a rock Zip said looked dirty, but he barely even knows what is and isn't dirty in the first place, see?
FO300032477	Nah. Zip kept asking if I have any Nuka-Cola hidden anywhere, so I told him I kept a six pack hidden near a magic rock. He'll be busy for weeks, see?
FO300032478	I changed my mind. I'll go with you to Rivet City.
FO300032479	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you'll consider meeting me in Rivet City.
FO300032480	I changed my mind. I'm not going to go with you right now.
FO300032481	That's good to hear. Let's not waste any time.
FO300032482	Can I think about it?
FO300032483	Screw it, I'm going for the faceoff!
FO300032484	Well, you're a little shorthanded, but you showed up for the game. The least I can do is make sure it's a short period.
FO300032485	Ice 'em guys!
FO300032486	Make it 400 caps and it's all yours.
FO300032487	Nicely played; and I know talent when I see it. Here you go.
FO300032488	Okay team, let's get out of here.
FO300032489	Fine, I'll take it.
FO300032490	Now that's teamwork! Good choice.
FO300032491	Okay team, let's get out of here.
FO300032492	I think you're all crazy, and I'm getting out of here.
FO300032493	Penalty! No one tries to put one past Goalie Ledoux!
FO300032494	Ice 'em guys!
FO300032495	Well, "captain", are we gonna fight or try and make a deal?
FO300032496	That's up to you. We can make a deal or we can faceoff.
FO300032497	I'm puttin' 250 caps up on the scoreboard. What do you say?
FO300032498	Okay, if you say so.
FO300032499	Now look, you gonna sell us that formula or do we have to faceoff?
FO300032500	I'm puttin' 250 caps up on the scoreboard. What do you say?
FO300032501	I think you've taken a few too many blows to the head, weirdo!
FO300032502	Penalty! No one tries to put one passed Goalie Ledoux!
FO300032503	Ice 'em guys!
FO300032504	What's with the masks, anyway?
FO300032505	This is the mask of my icegang, Sudden-Death Overtime. I'm the team captain, Goalie Ledoux.
FO300032506	There was a time where every city had their own icegangs and thousands would show up to watch them all duke it out in giant arenas.
FO300032507	We aim to bring those days back!
FO300032508	Who are you and why are you talking like that?
FO300032509	The name's Goalie Ledoux and I'm captain of Sudden-Death Overtime, the last of the icegangs.
FO300032510	There was a time where every city had their own icegangs and thousands would show up to watch them all duke it out in giant arenas.
FO300032511	We aim to bring those days back!
FO300032512	Hey, take it easy, I was just passing through.
FO300032513	Don't take slapshots at me like that! We saw you come out of the Nuka-Cola Plant and we know you've got the formula.
FO300032514	Now you gotta make a decision. Go for the powerplay or sit in the penalty box?
FO300032515	None of your damn business!
FO300032516	Penalty! That's gonna be 2 minutes in the box for you.
FO300032517	Ice 'em guys!
FO300032518	I'm here to tell you Mercier is dead.
FO300032519	Mercier didn't make it? Damn! How do they expect us to play when we don't even have enough people on our team?
FO300032520	Well, as long as you brought the formula, I guess we're still in the game.
FO300032521	I've got the formula for Nuka-Cola Clear.
FO300032522	Mercier didn't make it? Damn! How do they expect us to play when we don't even have enough people on our team?
FO300032523	Well, as long as you brought the formula, I guess we're still in the game.
FO300032524	May I have the key to the Research Safe?
FO300032525	Certainly, allow me to whip up a copy for you.
FO300032526	There you are. Have a wonderful and productive day!
FO300032527	Clean water is rare, and most water carries germs and radiation. As a result, it's usually healthier to stay dirty.
FO300032528	Remember, never trust anybody over the age of 16.
FO300032529	Little Lamplight only has one law: you have to leave when you grow up. No delays, no exceptions.
FO300032530	When scavenging in the wild, remember to trust no one and to keep your pistol handy!
FO300032531	Remember this simple rhyme: "When in danger or in doubt, shoot to kill and then run out."
FO300032532	Oh, and Vault kid? I know you were seen in the vicinity. I hope to God you had nothing to do with this carnage.
FO300032533	Do I suspect some Vault Dweller intervention on this one? I certainly do. Good work, 101.
FO300032534	I've gotten word that a band of mercs called Reilly's Rangers were trapped on a DC rooftop, pinned down by Super Mutants.
FO300032535	I killed Junders Plunkett.
FO300032536	Well, it's about time someone put that bastard out of his misery.
FO300032537	And here's the reward for it. Spend it well, Lawbringer.
FO300032538	Where did you come from?
FO300032539	I'm sort of stuck here. Colin says that I can't leave until I pay off my debt to him. Of course, he charges me room and board too.
FO300032540	If you ever get to Underworld, tell Carol that I said hi.
FO300032541	On second thought, I think I'll pass.
FO300032542	Oh! Okay.
FO300032543	Guess I'll see you around then.
FO300032544	Nah. I was just messing with ya.
FO300032545	You are such an asshole.
FO300032546	Well, I hope it all works out.
FO300032547	Yeah. On my own as usual. Sigh.
FO300032548	Look, why don't you come back later. I don't need pity right now.
FO300032549	There's tremendous risk in what you do and I bet Theo knew that.
FO300032550	Thanks. It's nice of you to try and make me feel better about everything.
FO300032551	I just hope that I can get back to mapping the ruins soon. I have a lot of contacts that are demanding I finish.
FO300032552	It is what it is.
FO300032553	Yeah, but I led the guys right into a corner. Theo died because I decided to take shelter in the hospital.
FO300032554	I'm not so sure I'd be trusted leading anyone at this point.
FO300032555	I'm in hiding now. I'm recording this in the reactor level. They found one of older recordings and now they want me in the labs.
FO300032556	Luckily I had a friend in the security team and they told me to run. So here I am.
FO300032557	What the hell am I supposed to do now? Merrick and his team are obviously experimenting on people. Someone's got to put a stop to it.
FO300032558	Sykes and Cossler dragged some unconscious guy from the dorms into the labs. I tried to ask what was going on, but they just glared at me.
FO300032559	After they came back out of the containment area, they told me not to tell anyone what I saw or I'd regret it.
FO300032560	Sykes was even patting his 10 millimeter when he said that. I think they were threatening to kill me!
FO300032561	I staggered out of there and came here to get this all down. What the hell are they doing in this place?
FO300032562	Things are getting a bit weird up here on the laboratory level. I swear I keep hearing these crazy noises coming from the experimentation chambers.
FO300032563	When I asked about it they told me it's the animals they're testing on. What the heck are they doing to them?
FO300032564	I think I may look into it some more. It gets boring standing in the hallways and pacing back and forth.
FO300032565	I'm making these recordings as a diary of my life in one of Vault-Tec's newer vaults. They recommended we keep one, so I figured why not.
FO300032566	But let me start at the beginning. My name is Shelton Delacroix, and I'm a security officer here in Vault 87.
FO300032567	I'm assigned to the laboratory level, which sure beats babysitting the reactor room!
FO300032568	Hopefully, in a few more months, I'll be allowed to learn a little more. It's all so hush hush. But that's the way things are around here.
FO300032569	Anyway, I'm due on shift soon, so I'll record more later.
FO300032570	Yep, you're right. He really cares about you!
FO300032571	Awww, both of you are so sweet! How did a gal like me get so lucky in this messed up world to find you two?
FO300032572	Now you've gone and made me cry. (Cries a bit)
FO300032573	If this place has living plants, does that mean the water is safe to drink?
FO300032574	I'm afraid the water still bears the mark of man's greed. It's His reminder of what we once were.
FO300032575	Perhaps one day He will see fit to lift this punishment, but I fear we have yet to command His full respect.
FO300032576	Harold makes unusual requests.
FO300032577	The Great One does tend to speak in riddles, but if that is His way, then so be it.
FO300032578	My talks with Him have become quite puzzling of late. I think He's beginning to fear His future.
FO300032579	The Great One's influence is growing and soon it will break free of the confines of this secluded vale.
FO300032580	We can't allow Oasis to call attention to itself like that. It would be the end of Him.
FO300032581	We are the Family and together we will stand united!
FO300032582	We will organize, we will prepare, we will teach you to cope with your differences and we will keep you alive.
FO300032583	Well rest easy now, my brothers and sisters. It's time to stop all of the running, all of the hiding and all of the denying.
FO300032584	We can not allow the humans to hunt us down and kill us like dogs! We must show them we are a force to be reckoned with!
FO300032585	The adaptation we were given wasn't meant to be ignored or persecuted. It's our way of survival.
FO300032586	I submit to you that we are the victims of evolution; the next step in mankind's acclimation to this hellish existence.
FO300032587	Are we THAT different from those who hunt for meat to survive or from those who kill for territory? Of course not.
FO300032588	Every one of us has been branded with these insults at some point in our lives. But why?
FO300032589	Monsters! Villains! Criminals! Animals!
FO300032590	AndaleHelloResponseShortJenny
FO300032591	Aww, I'm blushing!
FO300032592	That's so nice of you to say! Thank you!
FO300032593	Oh, you're embarrassing me!
FO300032594	Why thank you!
