[Main]
bGTCFix = 1 ; Fixes the 64hz microstutter issue.
bFastExit = 1 ; Prevents the game from hanging on exit.
bRedoHashtables = 1 ; Improves performance.
bModifyDirectXBehavior = 0 ; Enables the DirectX section.
bEnableThreadingTweaks = 1 ; Enables the ThreadingTweaks section.

[Hashtables]
bResizeHashtables = 1 ; Optimizes the game's hashtables which reduces menu lag.

[GTC]
bFPSFix = 1 ; Main switch for the FPSFix section.

[ThreadingTweaks]
; These two settings focus on reducing cell loading stutter caused by game's asset loading locking the render thread.
iReplaceTextureCreationLocks = 2 ; Improves performance of texture loading. Mode 2 is more aggressive but can (rarely) cause crashes.
iReplaceGeometryPrecacheLocks = 1 ; Improves performance of geometry loading by making it multithreaded.

bTweakMiscCriticalSections = 1 ; Improves performance of some critical sections by temporarily busy waiting when already locked.
bAddPauseToSpinLocks = 1 ; Improves spinlock performance. Can possibly have opposite effect on some (usually very old - pre 2013-14) systems.
bReplaceDeadlockCSWithWaitAndSleep = 1 ; Possible fix for randomly occuring freeze and crash (most noticeable in TTW).

[FPSFix]
iMaxFPSTolerance = 300 ; Do not edit.
iMinFPSTolerance = 5 ; Do not edit.
bfMaxTime = 1 ; Fixes sped up physics and animations beyond 60 FPS. It's still recommended to limit the framerate below 120 to avoid some rare crashes.
bSpiderHandsFix = 1 ; """Fix""" for the "spider hands" bug.

[DirectX]
bUseFlipModel = 0 ; Enables Flip Model presentation mode for fullscreen-level latency, performance and VRR support in windowed mode. This setting applies only to D3D9.
bUseDefaultPoolForTextures = 0 ; Required if using texture mods, breaks Alt-Tab in fullscreen exclusive (bFull Screen = 1). Read the performance guide for more information on how to use this effectively - https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html. 
bToggleTripleBuffering = 1 ; The game is double-buffered by default which can cause halved framerates.


; Do not edit, used to store D3D9 addresses for the Flip Model toggle
