DDM00000001	The war froze it in time, like a big flashbulb going off. The Grand Opening - one big ending of humanity.
DDM00000002	Except - the Sierra Madre never opened.
DDM00000003	A chance for anyone to begin again.
DDM00000004	... but for all who came to its doors.
DDM00000005	The opening was supposed to symbolize a road to a brighter future, not just for the world...
DDM00000006	An invitation was a sign of... exclusiveness.
DDM00000007	The world's most famous stars and entertainers were invited to its Grand Opening.
DDM00000008	These Ghost People... they're the only ones alive around here?
DDM00000009	I warned you to cooperate. Now I'll have to begin again.
DDM00000010	Speakers and radios interfere with the bomb collar frequency, and can trigger the detonators... prematurely.
DDM00000011	It is an unfortunate side effect, one I did not anticipate. I was unable to calibrate the collars to block the signals - so you'll have to make do.
DDM00000012	How did you get me here again?
DDM00000013	Everyone asks that. Should be asking how they plan on leaving.
DDM00000014	It only takes putting a collar on one to begin the chain. One with a collar may chain another. And that one, another. Had traps all over the wastes.
DDM00000015	The chain ends with the super mutant. Although with him... the collar wasn't even necessary. He only needed... guidance.
DDM00000016	Dog... just calm down... there's no need to keep fighting.
DDM00000017	No... Dog no listen to you, no listen to your voice anymore - will tear you apart, feed on you.
DDM00000018	There are damaged speakers, and shielded ones... the damaged ones you can destroy at range - don't get close, you can't switch them off like a radio.
DDM00000019	Aren't you upset?
DDM00000020	I've... done worse. Much worse... and for more hopeless causes, and I will again.
DDM00000021	He wasn't trying to torture you, he needed to alter your voice to use an audio-lock.
DDM00000022	To the vault... of course. That makes sense.
DDM00000023	An audio-lock to where? To the Sierra Madre vault. It's voice-activated. And he wanted in.
DDM00000024	That makes sense. So... those bodies in the Clinic... all right. Dean always felt like the odd one out, and he kept... studying me.
DDM00000025	Elijah didn't put you in the Auto-Doc... Dean did.
DDM00000026	Dean? Dean Domino?
DDM00000027	Why would he want to torture me? If he wanted to do that, he could keep his singing career going... or keep staring at me.
DDM00000028	You said you got off lucky?
DDM00000029	Yeah... I saw records of other "patients," and what had been done to them. Some couldn't hear anything but static. Others, just... gibbering wrecks.
DDM00000030	Never going back... and Elijah was on his way here, so I couldn't stop to see if it was something I could fix...
DDM00000031	...if you can even fix what happened to me when they jabbed the electrodes into my skull and turned my head into a flashlight.
DDM00000032	Then I got here, and my voice got severed... now I have a new one. Another thing Elijah has to answer for.
DDM00000033	Can the Auto-Doc heal your scars?
DDM00000034	No... they run a lot deeper than that.
DDM00000035	While I was hunting Elijah in the Big Empty, he trapped me in one of those medical research centers buried there.
DDM00000036	It... did something to my head... and I got off lucky. It's difficult enough to read now, and somehow the leap between what's in my head and words...
DDM00000037	...it just ends up being a mish-mash of symbols, not letters. Can still do math, formulas, equations... writing poetry's out.
DDM00000038	I had some questions I wanted to ask you.
DDM00000039	All right. Just glad I can answer you now.
DDM00000040	Anything you can download off of it?
DDM00000041	Looks like you got almost everything, not much more I can extract... "doctor."
DDM00000042	I can see... check the root, recent diagnostics...
DDM00000043	Lot of Med-X was dispensed for... Vera Keyes. Guess that's her corpse there for certain... and why all those meds are scattered around in here.
DDM00000044	...here's the medical report. Looks like she had some sort of terminal condition... diagnosis isn't conclusive, must have been painful.
DDM00000045	I'm not even sure she knew, if these medical reports are enough. She must have been numb most of the time.
DDM00000046	Does that Auto-Doc there work?
DDM00000047	Yeah, still functional. Lot of garbage data on it, its basic procedures should still work fine.
DDM00000048	Whatever, love is transitory - or ended in gunfire.
DDM00000049	I understand how important a loved one can be.
DDM00000050	[She nods slowly, studying you. She seems to be gauging you again.]
DDM00000051	[She makes a slow circle motion after a moment, taps her wrist.]
DDM00000052	Give me a little credit.
DDM00000053	What, you think I don't understand love?
DDM00000054	[She raises an eyebrow, looks at you.]
DDM00000055	Unrequited? Or...
DDM00000056	[She shakes her head, draws the two fingers together, then shakes her head more emphatically.]
DDM00000057	You were more than girlfriends - lovers.
DDM00000058	[She nods, and looks at you a little surprised.]
DDM00000059	Oh- girlfriend.
DDM00000060	[She hesitates, then waves her hand.]
DDM00000061	Oh - girlfriend.
DDM00000062	[She hesitates, then waves her hand.]
DDM00000063	What, your wife?
DDM00000064	[She shakes her head, but rolls it side to side.]
DDM00000065	Uh... boyfriend?
DDM00000066	[She shakes her head.]
DDM00000067	Oh - girlfriend.
DDM00000068	[She hesitates, then waves her hand.]
DDM00000069	Family? Husband?
DDM00000070	[She frowns, shakes her head, and even more so at husband.]
DDM00000071	He cut you off from someone.
DDM00000072	[She nods.]
DDM00000073	I don't understand.
DDM00000074	[She repeats the chopping motion, slower, then draws the two fingers apart. She looks sadly at one of the fingers.]
DDM00000075	So why would you waste time looking for him?
DDM00000076	[SUCCEEDED] [She frowns, raises two fingers, and has them walk together. Then she looks down on the two fingers, and her face becomes angry.]
DDM00000077	[Then she chops her hand down, and draws the two fingers apart. One of the finger she points at herself.]
DDM00000078	Sounds like it's pretty important to you to find this person.
DDM00000079	[FAILED] [She pauses, looks at you for a second, then shrugs and shakes her head.]
DDM00000080	...and nuts.
DDM00000081	[She nods, frowns.]
DDM00000082	Someone smart.
DDM00000083	[She nods, then circles her ear.]
DDM00000084	The man on the Pip-Boy holotape, Elijah.
DDM00000085	You were looking for a Vault Boy?
DDM00000086	[She shakes her head, points at your Pip-Boy again and makes a talking motion with her hand.]
DDM00000087	You were looking for a man in a Vault.
DDM00000088	[She shakes her head, points at your Pip-Boy again.]
DDM00000089	An... angry, bearded... man.
DDM00000090	[She points at your Pip-Boy.]
DDM00000091	[She nods, looks concerned, taps the side of her head, and expands her hands.]
DDM00000092	All right, someone alive.
DDM00000093	Or a woman?
DDM00000094	[She shakes her head... then stops mid-way, frowns... then tilts her head, as if thinking. She seems lost in thought for a moment.]
DDM00000095	[She glances at you, as if caught, then she smiles slightly, but there's an edge to it. Then she shakes her head, slowly, once.]
DDM00000096	Man?
DDM00000097	[She nods. She makes a motion with her hands around her chin, drawing it down, and then she raises her hands and clenches them at the sky.]
DDM00000098	A robot?
DDM00000099	[She shakes her head and pumps her fist near her chest.]
DDM00000100	This charades shit is driving me crazy.
DDM00000101	[She frowns and raises her middle finger.]
DDM00000102	Wherever you were, it was hot out.
DDM00000103	[She shakes her head and rolls her eyes.]
DDM00000104	You were looking for someone?
DDM00000105	[She nods and raises a finger.]
DDM00000106	You were... looking for something?
DDM00000107	[Shakes her head and makes a motion of two fingers walking.]
DDM00000108	You were over the moon?
DDM00000109	[She shakes her head and rolls her eyes.]
DDM00000110	Look... we'll find a way to heal you, all right?
DDM00000111	[She doesn't look at you, continues to stare darkly in front of her.]
DDM00000112	[After a moment, she glances at you, then taps the back of her wrist. She nods in front of her.]
DDM00000113	You really need to relax. This entire place is a Pre-War paradise, you know.
DDM00000114	[She looks at you, surprised. Then she opens her mouth as if to laugh... silently.]
DDM00000115	[Almost as soon as she utters her silent laugh, she stops, looks pained, and her expression becomes dark.]
DDM00000116	A smile... now that's more like it.
DDM00000117	[Still smiling, she rolls her eyes, and then slowly taps the back of her wrist.]
DDM00000118	What are you shaking and nodding for?
DDM00000119	[SUCCEEDED] [Her face wrinkles more, and then she gives a reluctant smile.]
DDM00000120	Okay, okay, I get it. <Nod slowly.> Better than finger snaps.
DDM00000121	[FAILED] [She looks frustrated, then makes a dismissive wave.]
DDM00000122	Things would be a lot easier if you did one snap for yes, two snaps for no.
DDM00000123	[She smiles humorlessly. She then nods once slowly. Then she shakes her head slowly.]
DDM00000124	[She then looks at you, her face wrinkled in a humorless smile.]
DDM00000125	Fine, be a bitch, then.
DDM00000126	I'm not the one trying to communicate with hand motions.
DDM00000127	[She gives you a snarl, glances at your collar, makes a dismissive wave.]
DDM00000128	You can't protect the world from the world... it's useless.
DDM00000129	[She points at your collar, then hers, and shakes her head slowly... then cuts the air with her hand and her face becomes blank.]
DDM00000130	You're worried someone's going to find this place? Use it to hurt people.
DDM00000131	[She nods slowly, hands still locked on her throat. She looks pained for a moment, and she breaks from your gaze.]
DDM00000132	[Her fingers flutter, almost frantically, for a second, and she runs her hands along her scalp, then her throat - then the collar.]
DDM00000133	[She points at your Pip-Boy, almost with frustration... then gestures all around her, and her shoulders seem to sag.]
DDM00000134	[After a moment, she glances back at you, glances around her, then shakes her head slowly.]
DDM00000135	Why do you want to do that?
DDM00000136	[She looks at you, as if surprised. Then glances at your collar, wrinkles her face, and points at it.]
DDM00000137	[She makes a wide sweeping circle of the area, looking around... then brings both hands back to her, then to her neck, and holds it.]
DDM00000138	[Her hands still on her neck, she looks at you gravely, then shakes her head.]
DDM00000139	You want to... hunt here?
DDM00000140	[SUCCEEDED] [She looks impressed, nods.]
DDM00000141	You want to kill something here, then protect this place.
DDM00000142	[FAILED] [She looks frustrated, then makes a dismissive wave.]
DDM00000143	Why would you want to stay here of all places?
DDM00000144	[She frowns, makes a mock motion of loading a gun, then hefting it to her shoulder and taking aim at something in the distance.]
DDM00000145	[Then she pauses, makes a sweeping circle, then puts her arms in a circle around it, as if covering it.]
DDM00000146	Are you trying to break into the casino?
DDM00000147	So you're after the treasure then?
DDM00000148	[She frowns, shakes her head... pauses... then tilts her head slightly, nods slowly.]
DDM00000149	You aren't going to leave.
DDM00000150	[She nods.]
DDM00000151	Why can't you find your way back?
DDM00000152	[She slowly shakes her head. She points at the ground, then moves each leg outward, straddling the place where she's pointing.]
DDM00000153	But not you.
DDM00000154	[She nods once.]
DDM00000155	...to return here if I leave.
DDM00000156	[She nods.]
DDM00000157	I... have no idea what you're saying. Again.
DDM00000158	[SUCCEEDED] [She shakes her head, points at herself, then points at you, nods.]
DDM00000159	You're saying it'll be difficult to return here if we leave.
DDM00000160	[FAILED] [She looks frustrated, then makes a dismissive wave.]
DDM00000161	So once the collars are gone, we can just leave?
DDM00000162	[She nods slowly, as if thinking. Then she raises an eyebrow, looks skeptical, then shrugs.]
DDM00000163	[She points downwards, makes a circle around her, then back to the same spot... and then her finger drifts, circling, and she makes a mock-frown.]
DDM00000164	Do you know how to get out of here?
DDM00000165	[She points in the direction of the main gate. Then points at your collar, shakes her head, and locks her hands around her neck.]
DDM00000166	[Then her hands lash outwards, fingers splayed and she rolls her eyes back. After a second she turns back to you shakes her head.]
DDM00000167	I can't believe you'd want to stay here.
DDM00000168	You're not going to leave.
DDM00000169	What about you?
DDM00000170	Are you saying it's one or the other?
DDM00000171	[She frowns. Glances in the direction of the casino, then the exit, then back in the direction of the casino.]
DDM00000172	[She shrugs... without strength or conviction. She isn't looking at you when she does.]
DDM00000173	Me? What about you?
DDM00000174	[She slowly shakes her head, then points at the ground.]
DDM00000175	If I could leave, I would.
DDM00000176	[She looks at you for a moment, glances at your collar, shrugs. She then lightly grabs her neck with both hands, holds it for a moment.]
DDM00000177	[Then her hands fall away. She looks at you, looks at the exit and nods.]
DDM00000178	I couldn't even tell you why, I just... did.
DDM00000179	Looking to start life as a Prospector, figured this place was a good place to start.
DDM00000180	[She frowns, puts her hands on her hips and glares at you. After a second, she rolls her eyes.]
DDM00000181	[She then makes a mocking, slow intake of breath, and then winces. Then she glances at you, points in the direction of main gate.]
DDM00000182	Thought I may have stumbled on an Old World treasure cache.
DDM00000183	Needed supplies, thought it might lead me somewhere interesting.
DDM00000184	...I was curious where it led.
DDM00000185	[She looks at you for a second, studying you. Then nods.]
DDM00000186	[She points at you, then points at the casino, and she slowly shakes her head - then points in the direction of the main gate.]
DDM00000187	<Raise an eyebrow back.>
DDM00000188	[Almost against her will, she smiles. After a moment, the smile fades, and she points at the ground again.]
DDM00000189	None of your business.
DDM00000190	[She shrugs, then taps the back of her palm in the direction of the Fountain.]
DDM00000191	[She shrugs, then taps the back of her palm, pointing West and down.]
DDM00000192	Followed a radio signal here, a woman's voice.
DDM00000193	[She waits. After a second, she raises her eyebrow again.]
DDM00000194	I... don't understand.
DDM00000195	[SUCCEEDED] [She smiles, nods.]
DDM00000196	You want to know how I got here?
DDM00000197	[FAILED] [She makes a mock sigh.]
DDM00000198	Did you circle the area, or...?
DDM00000199	What? What about my feet?
DDM00000200	[She repeats the circling motion again. This time, she lowers her hand and circles her finger inward, until she's pointing at the spot between you.]
DDM00000201	[Still pointing at the ground between you two, she raises an eyebrow.]
DDM00000202	Now... wait, you're acting like you don't trust me or something.
DDM00000203	[She continues to look at you for a moment, studying you, then her eyes fall to your collar, then your Pip-Boy.]
DDM00000204	[She glances back up at you, then she circles herself and points at the ground between you.]
DDM00000205	You think I had something to do with this?
DDM00000206	I didn't bring you here.
DDM00000207	[She looks at you for a moment, studying you. She doesn't move. After a second or two, she frowns.]
DDM00000208	[She frowns, glances at your feet, then nods. She then raises an eyebrow, points at you, makes a circle, then points at your feet.]
DDM00000209	Did you get gassed like I did?
DDM00000210	You were knocked out?
DDM00000211	[She nods. She raises an eyebrow, points at you, makes a circle, then points at your feet.]
DDM00000212	Now... back to the Suites. And we'll sing the lock open.
DDM00000213	You have the last fragment, that is all I need. Now...
DDM00000214	Go to the main lobby terminal, thread the music sequence together.
DDM00000215	Another fragment... good. Almost have the entirety of what I need from the music archives.
DDM00000216	Once you have the last fragment, you can thread the archives together at the main floor terminal.
DDM00000217	Once you have the last fragment, you can thread the archives together at the main floor terminal.
DDM00000218	You've gotten one of the floors re-established, good... accessing the music archives now. Two more to go.
DDM00000219	Oh... it seems the casino has uninvited guests... the Villa inhabitants were pounding at the doors - now they've found a way inside.
DDM00000220	Deal with them - and don't try and leave yourself, or I'll let the collar do its work.
DDM00000221	Oh... it seems the casino has uninvited guests... the Villa inhabitants were pounding at the doors - now they've found a way inside.
DDM00000222	Deal with them - and don't try and leave yourself, or I'll let the collar do its work.
DDM00000223	Watch out for the Villa inhabitants, they're... difficult to kill unless you chop them apart... if you can, blow them up or disintegrate them.
DDM00000224	Outside, you may notice your vision'll pulse, get dizzy. It's the Cloud. Eats your insides, slowly. Too much exposure, death.
DDM00000225	Villa's comm speakers have aged poorly, like the Madre. Pre-War junk. The speakers emit a signal that'll set off your collar if you stay too long.
DDM00000226	Picking up signals near your location. Detonators. Watch for traps.
DDM00000227	Leave the Salida del Sol gate alone. You're not done with the Villa yet, so don't stray.
DDM00000228	Don't go through the gate to Puesta del Sol yet - gather the others first.
DDM00000229	This gate to the Sierra Madre's sealed, locked. For now. Do as I say, and it won't be locked for much longer.
DDM00000230	That's the way out - after you break into the Sierra Madre's vault. Try to leave, I'll set off your collar.
DDM00000231	Damn speakers at end of hall - red light means they're shielded. Must be a way to shut them off somewhere else.
DDM00000232	Picking up an emitter signature - watch for security Holograms, dangerous. Don't shoot them - attacking them is useless.
DDM00000233	I can hear the event firing off. Now get to the main gate of the Sierra Madre, quickly.
DDM00000234	Get there soon or the doors will seal, and you'll be trapped outside.
DDM00000235	Get there soon or the doors will seal, and you'll be trapped outside.
DDM00000236	Get the mute down the elevator and into the Manual Override Chamber.
DDM00000237	There - the Switching Station. That's where you'll need to bring the mute.
DDM00000238	You're at the Ghoul's Gala area... now, make him stay.
DDM00000239	The bell tower. That's where you'll trigger the Gala Event. It's a ways up. I'm sure you'll find a way to climb up there.
DDM00000240	And once you get near the top... look for a ladder. It's easy to miss.
DDM00000241	And once you get near the top... look for a ladder. It's easy to miss.
DDM00000242	You're at one of the Gala locations, you'll need to bring the mutant here. Only he has the strength to operate the levers, I've found.
DDM00000243	[Christine nods at you, then the Ghost Person on the ground, makes a neck-chopping motion.]
DDM00000244	He's not dead... it's a trick. Get an axe.
DDM00000245	Better make sure he's dead. Poke him with a stick or something.
DDM00000246	Must be a back entrance to the kitchen - check the main casino side corridors. Find it.
DDM00000247	Hurry up and deal with the FEV reject, he's of no use to us.
DDM00000248	If that Ghoul's still alive... correct that. Or break him.
DDM00000249	Floor's buzzing with emitter signatures. Watch out for Holograms.
DDM00000250	Find the mute and deal with her. She's somewhere on this floor.
DDM00000251	Your collar's ticking. Get out of that floor!
DDM00000252	The door to the vault is voice-activated. Which means we need the starlet's voice. Or recordings of it.
DDM00000253	The elevator to the casino vault is locked, find a way to open it.
DDM00000254	Now get out, before your collar blows!
DDM00000255	Get to the door before the collar explodes, move!
DDM00000256	Now, deal with the Ghoul. This has gone on long enough.
DDM00000257	Door's sealed. Must be a key to the backstage. Hunt for it.
DDM00000258	How did you get here from the Gala Event? And onto this floor?
DDM00000259	The Gala went off, the Switching Station opened up - thought the screeching in the Auto-Doc was bad, Station worse.
DDM00000260	Got outside, saw the light show, and it was enough to make me run to the casino.
DDM00000261	Also... it seemed like the lights and speakers were helping to guide me... guess your master wanted a back-up in case you died.
DDM00000262	As for being assigned to this floor... maybe it's because of my new voice. Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe it recognized me as a guest.
DDM00000263	How did you get to the main gate? Then get here?
DDM00000264	The Gala went off, the Switching Station opened up - thought the screeching in the Auto-Doc was bad, Station worse.
DDM00000265	Got outside, saw the light show, and it was enough to make me run to the casino.
DDM00000266	Also... it seemed like the lights and speakers were helping to guide me... guess your master wanted a back-up in case you died.
DDM00000267	As for being assigned to this floor... maybe it's because of my new voice. Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe it recognized me as a guest.
DDM00000268	How did you get from the Gala Event to here?
DDM00000269	Me? I was halfway off the rooftop, through the service tunnel and bee-lining for the gate before the light show started...
DDM00000270	...and before Vera finished her Gala speech... I knew what'd happen with "music" in the streets and lights in the sky... Ghost People. Lots of them.
DDM00000271	But that was your problem. Anyway, front gate was open, no way I was letting you get in first. I walk in... there's a flash... and I'm here.
DDM00000272	Must have been Sinclair's security... he always had a thing about letting any threats into the casino. Security system's twitchy that way.
DDM00000273	Me, though, I'm a guest here, so I guess I got the royal treatment after all.
DDM00000274	How did you get from the Gala Event to here?
DDM00000275	I was already was halfway off the rooftop, through the service tunnel and making a break for the gate before the light show started...
DDM00000276	...and before Vera finished her Gala speech... I knew what'd happen with "music" in the streets and lights in the sky... Ghost People. Lots of them.
DDM00000277	Also meant the front gate was open, and no way was I missing it after all these years. Then... I walk in... and...
DDM00000278	I'm in control. The Master won't help Dog now... and it won't help you.
DDM00000279	Not listen, Dog out of cage now.
DDM00000280	If you have the key in there, the "Old Man" can order Dog to open the cage.
DDM00000281	Don't let him spot you! If he does, talk him down before he has a chance to ignite the gas.
DDM00000282	Shut off the gas valves, or that idiot'll kill us all.
DDM00000283	That idiot's opened the gas valves! A single spark - or he sets off his collar, the casino's going to burn. Us along with him.
DDM00000284	What weapons are you good at?
DDM00000285	Dog is better at the baser instincts than I... I merely have the brain for it.
DDM00000286	His sinew and muscle are difficult to move consciously... he's always hungry, clumsy, heavy.
DDM00000287	What weapons are you good at?
DDM00000288	Dog good at punching... hitting people with metal bear jaw until they go quiet.
DDM00000289	Dog sometimes pick up club when thing need to hit is big, need to punch in many places.
DDM00000290	What weapons are you skilled with?
DDM00000291	Not one for fighting if we can avoid it. Still, wasn't bad at the pistol range and over the years, I've learned how to handle a knife...
DDM00000292	...and explosives a bit. A bit. Made a lot of mistakes along the way. Still have my fingers, though.
DDM00000293	Oh, is that all? Guess that'll do.
DDM00000294	[She makes a disapproving frown, shakes her head.]
DDM00000295	You seem like you've been well-trained.
DDM00000296	[She shrugs slightly, then waits.]
DDM00000297	Energy Weapons, Explosives, Melee, Unarmed, and Guns. Is that all?
DDM00000298	[She nods. Once.]
DDM00000299	What weapons are you skilled at?
DDM00000300	[Christine draws a jagged lightning bolt in the air, pantomimes throwing a grenade, and then pulls an imaginary knife from behind her back.]
DDM00000301	[Then she moves her feet shoulder width apart, holds hands up in a martial arts stance, then turns both hands into pistols, pantomimes rapid-firing.]
DDM00000302	[She then holds one pistol up, takes aim as if sighting along the barrel and does a single shot, ends with a nod.]
DDM00000303	Always in the mood for another drink. What's the recipe?
DDM00000304	Sounds... interesting.
DDM00000305	Good, well done... now, for the festivities, and your parts in all this.
DDM00000306	The owner of the Sierra Madre... for whatever reason... keyed the Grand Opening to the Gala Event itself.
DDM00000307	It needs to be fired off in order for the casino doors to open. As I've discovered, one person can't do it.
DDM00000308	So, get your team in position indicated on your Pip-Boy, then trigger it properly.
DDM00000309	You're so close now, don't let me down. Otherwise, I'll have to rely on the next team.
DDM00000310	What do you need me to do now?
DDM00000311	Gather the three others needed for this job, return them here. After that, I'll have more instructions for you.
DDM00000312	Take the others to their positions to trigger the Gala Event. After that, the doors of the Sierra Madre should open.
DDM00000313	Will exposure kill me?
DDM00000314	No... while it will erode your health, it will only bring you to the point of death, no farther. At that point...
DDM00000315	The air here is lethal only if you enter concentrated pockets of the Cloud. Too long inside one, you'll die, so be careful where you step.
DDM00000316	I've seen some survive concentration of the Cloud for short periods of time if healthy enough - others were too weak.
DDM00000317	Rebreathers, chemical suits... there is no protection against it, it decays all it touches. I've found fighting it useless.
DDM00000318	Where is my gear?
DDM00000319	The Sierra Madre has many... defenses, means of screening guests for illicit or dangerous items. Your arrival here, weaponless, was not my intention.
DDM00000320	The Casino, this Villa... it takes anything with even a trace of radioactivity, traces of unknown substances... and returns it home. The bunker.
DDM00000321	The process is automated, and the casino itself has other, similar "services." I was unable to find a workaround, except to send others in as tools.
DDM00000322	Why is my vision blurring?
DDM00000323	It is the Cloud covering the Villa. The longer you are outside, the more its toxins seep into your system... through the lungs and the skin.
DDM00000324	It will eat at you the longer you are outside... so wherever you go, move fast, or you'll soon find yourself too weak to move.
DDM00000325	It is the Cloud that surrounds the Villa. It shouldn't prove lethal in the time you are here... prolonged exposure would be hazardous, however.
DDM00000326	Fall asleep... and you will not wake up.
DDM00000327	Is there anyone alive around here?
DDM00000328	Yes... the inhabitants... avoid them if you can, they are difficult to kill.
DDM00000329	Whatever has created them, bullets, explosions, energy... it can make them inert for a time, then they seem to crawl back up, restored.
DDM00000330	Perhaps it's the Cloud... perhaps something in their physiology.
DDM00000331	How did I get here?
DDM00000332	I brought you here. There are mechanisms in place once the traps across the Mojave are sprung.
DDM00000333	For now, your sole focus should be the Sierra Madre, and how to get inside. Until then, you won't leave alive.
DDM00000334	What is this place?
DDM00000335	Unfamiliar with the legend of the Sierra Madre? The casino exists. You are one of the few who look upon it.
DDM00000336	Where you're standing is the Villa beneath the casino above. The wreckage... the Villa... lies in the shadow.
DDM00000337	The Villa is a dumping ground of failed construction... Pre-War junk that has aged poorly.
DDM00000338	I had other questions.
DDM00000339	I am short on patience. And you are short on time.
DDM00000340	Ask.
DDM00000341	No, I'm not helping you.
DDM00000342	Then you are of no use to me.
DDM00000343	I'm not going to help you.
DDM00000344	When you came into the bunker, you saw a victim, their head blown off for disobedience.
DDM00000345	The city is filled with other stories, many such stories. Is "no" your choice?
DDM00000346	What do you want?
DDM00000347	That structure you see above the Fountain - the Sierra Madre Casino... you need to break inside. A... heist. Too many years in the making.
DDM00000348	But to get inside, avoid its traps... you'll need to gather the team. As I've found, one cannot do it alone.
DDM00000349	Around the Villa are three other collars like yours - Collar 8, 12, and 14. Find all three and get them here, to the Fountain. Then, we'll talk more.
DDM00000350	And should you get any ideas about killing each other and taking the treasure of the Sierra Madre for yourself - a warning.
DDM00000351	All your collars are linked... one of you dies, you all die. If that's what it takes to make you cooperate, so be it.
DDM00000352	Collar? What are you talking about?
DDM00000353	It's like that Pip-Boy on your wrist, except filled with explosives. A little radio of the Old World, just needed some tuning.
DDM00000354	Do what I say, and the collar won't go off... refuse, try and run, disobey me? I'll kill you and find someone else.
DDM00000355	There's no escape from here until I let you go. The sooner you accept your situation, the better.
DDM00000356	Are you listening? Good. From now on, when I talk, listen - and follow my instructions.
DDM00000357	Play stupid, play clever, make the mistake of saying "no?" That collar on your neck'll go off and take your head with it.
DDM00000358	That's all I needed to know.
DDM00000359	Good. If necessary, I will guide you through the Villa's broadcast systems - if you get lost, return here, and I'll direct you.
DDM00000360	I've downloaded instructions on an audio log to your Pip-Boy in case you can't read... if you forget why you're here, let my voice remind you.
DDM00000361	Then go. The Sierra Madre may wait... I will not.
DDM00000362	Who are these people I'm gathering?
DDM00000363	One is a trusted ally... obedient, collar or no, although the collar helps. The other two... well, we'll have to see what the traps caught.
DDM00000364	All right. So find the other three people with bomb collars, bring them back here?
DDM00000365	I've downloaded the instructions and markers on your Pip-Boy... in case you forget. And yes, I have access to that device on your wrist.
DDM00000366	Get the other three here, after that... I'll have more instructions for you.
DDM00000367	Do this, I'll let you go. I'll let all of you go.
DDM00000368	Radios and speakers can set off my collar?
DDM00000369	Yes. But not immediately. You'll hear a beep from your collar's detonator - when you do, step back, scan the area, and find the signal source.
DDM00000370	There are damaged speakers, and shielded ones... the damaged ones you can destroy at range - don't get close, you can't switch them off like a radio.
DDM00000371	The damaged speakers are sparking, ha... hard to miss. The casings are resistant to vandalism - punching or hitting them will not destroy them.
DDM00000372	Radios and speakers?
DDM00000373	Yes, music was intended to be broadcast all over the Villa... over time, however, the radio signal has decayed and emits a different frequency.
DDM00000374	Speakers and radios interfere with the bomb collar frequency, and can trigger the detonators... prematurely.
DDM00000375	It is an unfortunate side effect, one I did not anticipate. I was unable to calibrate the collars to block the signals - so you'll have to make do.
DDM00000376	How are you speaking to me?
DDM00000377	Confused? Don't be. I'm commandeering the hologram technology of the Villa.
DDM00000378	Numbers, equations, circuits... all can be controlled, provided there's a connection, and the knowledge to use it.
DDM00000379	This Villa, the casino... a treasure trove of such devices. The Holograms included.
DDM00000380	Who are you?
DDM00000381	Someone who followed the call of the Sierra Madre, just as you did. Now that I've found it's more than a story... I intend to take what's inside.
DDM00000382	Maybe that's why you came. Why you followed the Pip-Boy here... and straight into one of my traps. Now, this is your reward.
DDM00000383	Is there any place safe to rest?
DDM00000384	Anywhere sheltered from the Cloud... inside buildings, tunnels... any place not exposed to the outside air.
DDM00000385	Anything the Cloud has touched has preserved it one way or another... but only the Holograms in the Villa truly remain.
DDM00000386	What Holograms are you talking about?
DDM00000387	The inhabitants? There's people alive here?
DDM00000388	What are the Vending Machines in the Villa?
DDM00000389	Assembly stations. Schematics are stored within... dispensers with unlock codes.
DDM00000390	They use the Chips scattered around as batteries... alloys and raw material embedded in the shell.
DDM00000391	They resemble the vending machines of the Mojave, but they are crafting devices of tremendous versatility. Once an Old World convenience, now...
DDM00000392	...now, they are a means of survival. Use the Chips to power them. Select from the holographic display, the device will assemble it.
DDM00000393	What is the Cloud?
DDM00000394	The Cloud is what blankets the sky here... you may smell it in the air, copper and sulfur... burns the lungs and seeps into the skin.
DDM00000395	As for its origins... I am not certain. Pre-War industrial pollutants... something in the Sierra Madre structure...
DDM00000396	It is unique across the wasteland... and deadly. It has kept this place preserved since the Great War.
DDM00000397	Can you tell me about the Holograms in the Villa?
DDM00000398	Why?
DDM00000399	Most Holograms perform specific functions. The Security Holograms, ever since the bombs fell, now perform their function.
DDM00000400	They will kill anyone they detect. They are immune to guns, weapons, EMPs... even energy weapons. Still, they have limitations.
DDM00000401	Their design limits their field of view, enough to avoid detection.
DDM00000402	Each has an emitter - destroy or disable it, and they cease to be a threat.
DDM00000403	Still... at least they still work as intended. Other technology here is more of a threat to you... notably, the Villa's radios and speakers.
DDM00000404	What are these Holograms?
DDM00000405	Ghosts... they fill the Villa. More in the Casino... much more.
DDM00000406	They carry out the functions the dead once did. They cannot be harmed... they only perform the same rote tasks until their power dies.
DDM00000407	They are of no consequence - except for the Security Holograms, the ones with the silhouettes of the armored Sierra Madre guards.
DDM00000408	What's FEV?
DDM00000409	A long story. FEV... a virus with an even longer story... it gave birth to the docile one, turned him into a Super Mutant long ago.
DDM00000410	Any suggestions for who I should get first?
DDM00000411	Yes... Collar 8, the FEV reject, the Super Mutant. He's docile, predictable, and provided he's not starving, should be easy to command.
DDM00000412	I lost contact with him some time ago... probably after he dragged you here from the trap. Find him, he'll follow you, collar or no.
DDM00000413	How am I supposed to find them?
DDM00000414	Your piece of RobCo trash will help you, I've ensured it. It can latch on to the signal of the collars...
DDM00000415	...and tune into their frequencies. The bomb collars come with radios embedded in them. You can eavesdrop easily.
DDM00000416	It was part of their design... to listen in. They can even screen out white noise from the environment to allow greater monitoring.
DDM00000417	You have got to be kidding. This place is filled with radio mines that can kill me?
DDM00000418	So I have to deal with them - or I explode?
DDM00000419	Forget it, then. I'll be on my way.
DDM00000420	I'll cooperate - if you can answer some questions for me.
DDM00000421	I've decided I'm not going to help you.
DDM00000422	When you came into the bunker, you saw a victim, their head blown off for disobedience.
DDM00000423	The city is filled with other stories, many such stories. Is "no" your choice?
DDM00000424	Never mind, then.
DDM00000425	I had questions.
DDM00000426	How did I get here?
DDM00000427	Hmm! Get here? You walked into one of my traps in the Mojave... following the Sierra Madre signal. Now, you're here, with that collar on your neck.
DDM00000428	Then maybe you better tell me why I'm here.
DDM00000429	I'm not alone, then.
DDM00000430	You've caught others?
DDM00000431	Who's the woman Hologram in the Fountain?
DDM00000432	I do not know. A Pre-War icon, perhaps. It is of no consequence aside from being a circuit I can utilize.
DDM00000433	If I can't punch them or smash them, that doesn't leave me many options.
DDM00000434	Aside from switching them off, what can I do?
DDM00000435	How are they different?
DDM00000436	"Security" doesn't sound safe to me.
DDM00000437	What is this rifle?
DDM00000438	It is a Holorifle, a weapon I constructed when I arrived... I have since made superior models - and modifications.
DDM00000439	For now, that tool will have to do until you find other weapons... and I suggest you do, the Holorifle's ammo is limited.
DDM00000440	Still, it should serve well enough. I fashioned it from the Holograms of the Villa and used it against the Villa's... living inhabitants.
DDM00000441	What do you mean?
DDM00000442	This place is well-preserved. Few who came here ever returned. All of the treasures of the Old World lie scattered about, virtually untouched.
DDM00000443	Search, hunt... craft what you can from what you find. The trash of the Pre-War era can keep you alive - food, knives, more. Use them.
DDM00000444	Even the Villa's toxins... and the residue it leaves behind... can be shaped into tools and weapons. Gather it as well.
DDM00000445	Also... there is one more thing in your possession, a rifle that will keep you alive, as surely as the collar will.
DDM00000446	Where is my gear?
DDM00000447	The Sierra Madre has many... defenses, means of screening guests for illicit or dangerous items. Your arrival here, weaponless, was not my intention.
DDM00000448	The Casino, this Villa... it takes anything with even a trace of radioactivity, traces of unknown substances... and returns it home. The bunker.
DDM00000449	The process is automated, and the casino itself has other, similar "services." I was unable to find a workaround, except to send others in as tools.
DDM00000450	Still... I have not left you defenseless, and the Sierra Madre's security in some respects, can help you if you are resourceful enough.
DDM00000451	How many of these victims did you bring here?
DDM00000452	Too many. This place is dangerous... and its quarantine measures, its hazards... have claimed many. Failures upon failures.
DDM00000453	Do you think I wanted to place collars on you to ensure compliance? No... if robots could have done this, I would've sent them.
DDM00000454	The Sierra Madre is a complicated lock. Cracking it open requires human hands.
DDM00000455	What's inside the Sierra Madre?
DDM00000456	That is for me to know. You get that far... you'll see for yourself.
DDM00000457	Are they all dead?
DDM00000458	The ones brought here live on only in what they've left behind, their marks - graffiti on the walls. And victims they've killed.
DDM00000459	Some tried to help... left supplies and healing for others who came. Their reward? They were tracked down, killed by others with baser instincts.
DDM00000460	Some of these murderers went as far as to leave traps behind them... turning markers for help into deathtraps for anyone following them.
DDM00000461	It killed some of them when they forgot where the traps lay... or when they desperately needed the assistance they had cut others off from.
DDM00000462	I'll help. What do you want me to do?
DDM00000463	Why would you do that?
DDM00000464	Because in some respects, breaking in to the Sierra Madre is easier than breaking human instinct. Greed.
DDM00000465	The Villa is filled with corpses. Some killed by the dangers here, some by me. Others... turned on each other.
DDM00000466	Once they realized the Sierra Madre could be theirs, they cared nothing for their freedom... their survival... or each other.
DDM00000467	So I need others to pull off this... heist. Who?
DDM00000468	So how do I destroy the radios and speakers then?
DDM00000469	Gunshots, energy blasts - even spears thrown with great force - can puncture their exterior.
DDM00000470	Shielded speakers can't be destroyed at all. You'll need to avoid them or switch them off via a terminal. I... I'll leave the method up to you.
DDM00000471	What do you mean?
DDM00000472	The real work? What was this, a warm-up?
DDM00000473	Perhaps you think this is a simple robbery. A cheap casino heist.
DDM00000474	No... this is a heist of the centuries. We're not plundering the Sierra Madre - we're plundering history, taking from the Old World itself.
DDM00000475	It won't let its secrets go easily... not without a fight. I wouldn't expect anything less.
DDM00000476	We'll head out, then.
DDM00000477	I'd suggest taking the FEV reject to his position first... although you may need his brutality and strength elsewhere first.
DDM00000478	As easy as the Villa was to navigate... the outlying areas of the Villa are far more dangerous, thicker with the Ghost People, traps, and toxins.
DDM00000479	Use your team as I use you... listen to your collar, watch where you step. You're no use to me dead.
DDM00000480	What is the Gala Event?
DDM00000481	A display of lights, fireworks... music in the streets, a Pre-War festival to mark the casino's opening. The bombs struck first.
DDM00000482	It is of no consequence, only firing the event is - get the three in position, then travel to your position in Salida del Sol and trigger the Gala.
DDM00000483	After that, the real work begins.
DDM00000484	How am I supposed to get to the markers on my map?
DDM00000485	I've unlocked the West and East gates to Puesta del Sol and Salida del Sol...
DDM00000486	...now that you've survived the Villa, I need to get to my position, you don't need me to hold your hand anymore.
DDM00000487	I'll keep monitoring you via the transceivers through the Villa... if I need to offer guidance, I will.
DDM00000488	Where can I find him?
DDM00000489	Travel West, toward the Villa Police Station - follow the radio frequency and the alarms.
DDM00000490	Although there's a great deal of interference at the source. Perhaps that's why I lost contact with him.
DDM00000491	No matter, aside from Collar 8, there should be weapons, armor at the police station. Go West, avoid the Villa inhabitants, bring the mutant back.
DDM00000492	So after your speech about control, now you're going to use the collars like Elijah did?
DDM00000493	You know what... you're right. I don't need to use the same methods to kill you, and I shouldn't... it would make me as bad as Elijah is.
DDM00000494	All right - forget the proximity frequency, we'll decide this ourselves.
DDM00000495	When we were sneaking, you mentioned Lou... who's Lou?
DDM00000496	Lou... ten... ant? Long ago. Smart. Gave us all things to do. Like watch. And kill. Gone now.
DDM00000497	Miss Lou. Miss the Base. Miss the Church. Don't like here. Don't want to talk about it any more, makes head hurt.
DDM00000498	If you don't stay here, I'll bring Dog out and leave him here.
DDM00000499	And what would that gain you? Are you so eager to slice off your hand to spite your arm?
DDM00000500	Sounds to me if I bring Ghost People here, you couldn't handle them.
DDM00000501	I can't trust Dog to do this properly. I can trust you.
DDM00000502	I need someone who can operate the switches - and stay in control.
DDM00000503	Because this requires intelligence, and I trust you to do this.
DDM00000504	I don't want Dog to have to deal with this, I prefer to deal with you.
DDM00000505	Really. And why is that? Dog is much more... docile. Obedient.
DDM00000506	Yeah, well, I'll make Dog help me. Can't be hard to figure all this wire stuff out.
DDM00000507	[SUCCEEDED] You think you can figure out what to... hnh. Of course you can.
DDM00000508	I'll stand at my post. Once you trigger the event... well, we'll see who makes it to the Sierra Madre.
DDM00000509	If that diagram over there holds the details, I can walk Dog through the instructions.
DDM00000510	[FAILED] No... you can barely give me instructions, let alone order Dog. Bark your orders somewhere else.
DDM00000511	If you know how to operate the switches, I need you to trust me to get through this.
DDM00000512	I'm not about to fight any more Ghost People just to feed you... or Dog.
DDM00000513	We don't really have time for this.
DDM00000514	If you don't... then I can't guarantee I'll remain in control long enough to help you. It is... your choice.
DDM00000515	So some of the "meat" inside them?
DDM00000516	All right, I'll go hunting, see what I can find.
DDM00000517	Two chunks of meat from their bodies should be enough. Hunt... quietly, so as not to draw more here.
DDM00000518	I expect you to do what you're told.
DDM00000519	If that's what it takes to make you listen, yes.
DDM00000520	So you want me to listen. To obey. No... I can't. Because Dog wouldn't let me. I can already feel him clawing at me.
DDM00000521	If you want me to remain, then I'll need to stay aware... enough to operate the switches properly.
DDM00000522	I... we just need to make sure that Dog doesn't surface before that happens. To do that... he'll need to be fed. That makes him stay in the Cage.
DDM00000523	I just want to kill him anyway.
DDM00000524	Maybe you're right, killing him is the best option.
DDM00000525	He came this way for a reason, and I want to know why.
DDM00000526	[She then slowly shakes her head and draws an "X" in the air.]
DDM00000527	I don't care. I'd rather reason with someone first than simply kill them.
DDM00000528	[She then slowly shakes her head and draws an "X" in the air.]
DDM00000529	I'm not out to kill anyone, I just want to get out of here.
DDM00000530	[Christine looks at you, then shakes her head, points at your collar, then the front gate and shakes her head.]
DDM00000531	I'd like to know why he did all this first and what's so important about the casino.
DDM00000532	[Christine's expression becomes furious, and she raises her hands, draws jagged lines in the air.]
DDM00000533	[She then points at you, then the direction of the casino, and makes the motion of two hands talking to each other.]
DDM00000534	[As one hand continues to talk, she moves the other hand to the wrist, and constricts until the other hand slows, stops talking.]
DDM00000535	Could always slap a collar on him and let him run into a wall of speakers.
DDM00000536	[Christine's expression relaxes slightly, and she nods.]
DDM00000537	I'm fine with killing the son of a bitch. As long as we can torture him first.
DDM00000538	[She nods grimly. She seems satisfied.]
DDM00000539	You mean business.
DDM00000540	He's responsible for the scars.
DDM00000541	You want to kill him.
DDM00000542	[She gives a nod. Then another nod, even slower.]
DDM00000543	Why are you looking for him?
DDM00000544	[She wrinkles her face, frowns, and looks angry. She touches her throat, traces the scar with her finger, then points the finger at the casino.]
DDM00000545	[She then points at your collars, points at the casino. Then she matches your gaze with a dark expression, then draws a slow line across her throat.]
DDM00000546	Elijah? You need to see Elijah.
DDM00000547	You're looking for the man inside the casino.
DDM00000548	[She nods.]
DDM00000549	You kind of... changed there for a second.
DDM00000550	[SUCCEEDED] [She looks like she's about to shake her head, stops, and then puts her hand over her eyes and squints, as if staring in the distance.]
DDM00000551	Don't ignore me - your whole body language changed there.
DDM00000552	[FAILED] [She glares at you a moment, then slowly shakes her head.]
DDM00000553	Um, do you want to talk about it, or...?
DDM00000554	[SUCCEEDED] [She looks like she's about to shake her head, stops, and then puts her hand over her eyes and squints, as if staring in the distance.]
DDM00000555	No, before we go any further, I need to know what the problem is.
DDM00000556	[FAILED] [She glares at you a moment, then slowly shakes her head.]
DDM00000557	You really want to get to him, don't you.
DDM00000558	[She ignores you for a second, still staring at the casino. Then she glances at you, and her face and stance relax slightly.]
DDM00000559	[She points at her collar, then the casino with an irritated look. She then folds her arms and raises an eyebrow.]
DDM00000560	He's broadcasting from the casino.
DDM00000561	[Christine looks at you, frowns. Then glances at the casino, her eyes narrowed. She stops breathing for a second, as if holding it in.]
DDM00000562	You can still do numbers and calculations.
DDM00000563	[She nods.]
DDM00000564	You can still do math, that's good to hear.
DDM00000565	[She nods, smiles.]
DDM00000566	Why... would someone remove your ability to write, or...
DDM00000567	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, slowly, and then makes the motion of typing and drawing X's and lines in the air, and then gives a thumbs up.]
DDM00000568	That's a specific form of brain surgery using electrodes. Pre-War.
DDM00000569	[FAILED] [She looks distant... then slowly shakes her head.]
DDM00000570	That's a rather specific form of operation.
DDM00000571	So... brain damage, or...?
DDM00000572	[She shakes her head... then stops, as if thinking.]
DDM00000573	Something to do with the surgery.
DDM00000574	[She pauses, then draws a jagged symbol like electricity in the air, then puts on an odd, staring face.]
DDM00000575	[She keeps the blank face for a second, then slowly blinks, looks around. She looks at her hands, shakes them, then lets them go limp.]
DDM00000576	This nodding, frowning, pointing you do is wearing me out.
DDM00000577	[SUCCEEDED] [Christine frowns, then pauses and traces one of the scars on her head with her finger.]
DDM00000578	[She then makes a motion as if picking up a pencil, tries to write, then shakes her head.]
DDM00000579	Can't you communicate some other way? Can you write?
DDM00000580	[FAILED] [Christine nods, frowns, then points at you, then points West. Then she glares at you.]
DDM00000581	Reach around to the chain on your neck, see if you can find a key.
DDM00000582	Go to the Fountain and wait for me there.
DDM00000583	Master, Dog waited a long time... brought you many people. If Dog finds more, will bring them to the Fountain, Dog promises.
DDM00000584	Fine. Let's go, follow me.
DDM00000585	Yes, Master. Dog waited a long time... brought you many people. Dog will follow.
DDM00000586	Already have a Dog with you... Dog will meet you at the Fountain. Maybe find food on the way.
DDM00000587	Shut up, reject, and give me the key. Now.
DDM00000588	Yes, Master. Here, Dog sorry, Dog... just... just let Dog out of the cage. Don't want to be here any longer.
DDM00000589	Just give me the key - you want out of the cage, don't you?
DDM00000590	Yes, Master... Master sounds different, quieter. Master... Dog doesn't want to be in the cage any more. Dog will be good this time, Dog promises.
DDM00000591	Now that you are awake, Master wants you to listen, Dog.
DDM00000592	Master, Dog is here. What does Master want?
DDM00000593	I need your obedience. First, I'm going to show you a trick.
DDM00000594	Does Master want Dog to fetch someone? Dog will hunt down whoever you want, bring them here.
DDM00000595	Dog, hidden on you is the key. Find it, and toss it to me.
DDM00000596	Dog... Dog doesn't have a... hnh. Here it is. Dog... Dog didn't know it was there. How did it get there?
DDM00000597	Surprised they could hear you over the alarm bell outside.
DDM00000598	[SUCCEEDED] Very good. Yes... it's another layer of white noise to ensure privacy. Unfortunately, it's also acted as a dinner bell for the residents.
DDM00000599	As long as the holographic greeter outside is active, however, I can get by them... the Holograms fascinate them. Ghost-worship, perhaps.
DDM00000600	...and the alarm sound outside helps as well. Your doing?
DDM00000601	[FAILED] Yes... interesting that. More like a dinner bell to some.
DDM00000602	What do you mean?
DDM00000603	The... inhabitants of the Villa. They are difficult to kill. They need to be chopped apart, hacked on the ground... disintegrated, if you can.
DDM00000604	They are difficult to kill... but not to devour. And Dog is always hungry.
DDM00000605	If he is with you, when they fall, he will fall on them, end them. If I am with you... fighting will be far more difficult.
DDM00000606	In that case, I will bring him along, I don't need you.
DDM00000607	And so... greed, practical or otherwise, has its day.
DDM00000608	Even if Dog is more helpful, we can manage.
DDM00000609	I am not sure you belong here. No, you don't belong here.
DDM00000610	Yet... you came this far. And I'm not interested in remaining here any longer. I'll unlock the cage.
DDM00000611	I can't convince you I'm not here for the Sierra Madre or the Old Man, so I'll prove it.
DDM00000612	Prove it... how? Words are worthless.
DDM00000613	I have the power to let Dog out of his cage. I'm going to prove it by not doing it.
DDM00000614	Hnh. No... no, you're not. Even though Dog's more docile... easier to control.
DDM00000615	You may regret this. This place... this place is where creatures like Dog can survive. The people that fill its streets...
DDM00000616	He is as vicious, more vicious than them. His hunger can help you more than I can. When I am in control... this shell is difficult to... fight in.
DDM00000617	Calm down. Follow me, willingly, I won't do it.
DDM00000618	No, you wouldn't. If you did, you won't escape this place alive. I'd shatter every one of your limbs to splinters and leave you here.
DDM00000619	You think I'm afraid of your collar exploding, killing us? No, I'll leave you breathing, then keep walking until my collar goes cold.
DDM00000620	I'll prop your broken body in view of the Sierra Madre so you can see what you came to steal... forever out of reach as you die.
DDM00000621	Goodbye, whoever you are... I'm going to let Dog out of his cage.
DDM00000622	No! No, no, don't! I'll make you suffer for this, I promise you.
DDM00000623	Although it may not matter... I suspect the Sierra Madre will be reward enough for ones like you.
DDM00000624	What if we go after the Old Man together?
DDM00000625	No... I don't trust you. Even if you're not working with him, you'll fall into the same trap he did.
DDM00000626	You may think you can take your revenge... that'll change. You'll start thinking there's a way to have it all.
DDM00000627	I want my freedom, too. You think I like having this collar on me?
DDM00000628	They all wanted their freedom at first. Then... they realized they could get inside the Sierra Madre.
DDM00000629	After that, their freedom wasn't important any more. They couldn't let go, just like the Old Man. So you say you want your freedom...
DDM00000630	No... even if you feel that way, it won't last. You'll forget, get greed-blind, and you'll turn.
DDM00000631	The Old Man's voice is on my Pip-Boy, just like yours.
DDM00000632	I can play his voice, yes. I have an audio log from him on my Pip-Boy.
DDM00000633	You... don't play it. If you do, I'll find a way to get out of the cage, end you. I'll murder you, crush your arms and legs until...
DDM00000634	If he hears the Old Man's voice, he'll do what the Old Man says.
DDM00000635	Dog... obeys. Yes. Why... do you have some means of contacting the Old Man?
DDM00000636	Do you want to die? Cooperate, or you're both dead.
DDM00000637	I could just tell Dog he has the key.
DDM00000638	Yes... you could. And once he was out, all starving and hungry... what do you think he would do then?
DDM00000639	Be careful what cage you open, because he won't go back in it without a fight. He'll tear you apart, he won't care if it kills you both.
DDM00000640	The key's in there with you - and Dog.
DDM00000641	Yes, but Dog doesn't know that. We don't share everything. Sometimes it's a blessing... sometimes... it causes difficulties.
DDM00000642	Now I think it's a blessing, it keeps you on that side of the cage. Now... you go fetch. Find your master, bring him here so we can talk.
DDM00000643	I could order Dog to come with me. I bet he'd obey.
DDM00000644	Dog? You're not talking to him now, are you? No, even if you could drag Dog out of his cage, you still couldn't get him out of this cage.
DDM00000645	I put him here for a reason... if he could have escaped, he would have. So here he stays.
DDM00000646	If you don't come with me, he'll set off our collars - yours and mine.
DDM00000647	Then I still win. I'd rather die in this cell than have Dog follow him any longer, follow his orders, his commands, desperate for recognition.
DDM00000648	The Old Man... he has the need to hold on, to the past, to the Madre... I'd rather be free, let go of this shell, than have it cage me any longer.
DDM00000649	Why did you surround yourself with all these radios?
DDM00000650	[SUCCEEDED] They were here when I arrived... so I made use of them, in a manner of speaking. More their... voices, really.
DDM00000651	These collars... they don't just track us. You can eavesdrop on them as well. Tune to a frequency, and you can hear everything someone is saying.
DDM00000652	So perhaps it's a good thing that Dog swallowed his collar. Anyone listening would find it difficult to hear past the... digestion.
DDM00000653	These radios, were you using them for signal interference?
DDM00000654	[FAILED] I was afraid Dog would get lonely. The voices, as static and whispering as they are... are still company.
DDM00000655	So... you're locked in there? Where's the key?
DDM00000656	[SUCCEEDED] The key? Why it's the Old Man, the one who brought us here.
DDM00000657	I hid the key on me so Dog wouldn't know... I just need the Old Man to show up, so he and I can talk.
DDM00000658	If Dog was in control when the Old Man appeared... well, he would just do whatever he commanded, as always. And I can't have that.
DDM00000659	You wouldn't have locked yourself in there without some sort of key to let you out.
DDM00000660	[FAILED] It's close, safe, as you know.
DDM00000661	[FAILED] It's close, safe. I did lock myself in, after all.
DDM00000662	Wait. So you... or Dog... doesn't know the key is on him?
DDM00000663	Dog and I don't share... everything. What I know, he doesn't.
DDM00000664	What he knows... what little he knows... I don't. For example, your arrival is a surprise. I wished that I could have remembered, I'm sure Dog knew.
DDM00000665	And when he's feeding, well... I sometimes have to find out about it later. Now all there is to do is wait for my intended guest.
DDM00000666	If you locked him... you... in, what if you couldn't get out?
DDM00000667	Oh, I have the key, always did. Hid it on the chain behind my neck before Dog came bursting out, eating everything he could.
DDM00000668	Wanted to make sure whoever came to fetch Dog spoke to me first, got within reach. Instead... I get you.
DDM00000669	So why did you bring me here?
DDM00000670	What is he doing here?
DDM00000671	Heard the call of the Sierra Madre, just like you did... exactly the same way.
DDM00000672	Finds out it's more than a story, comes to this shining poisonous grail, this jewel of the desert.
DDM00000673	Dog knows him more than I do. Dog's always nodding, always obeying him, because he's weak and hungry and greedy for master's affection.
DDM00000674	Scorched by the sun?
DDM00000675	The Old Man... this "Elijah," tried to hold the sun in his hands, arrogance, was cast down for it. Icarus' crime was to fly too high, Elijah...
DDM00000676	Elijah wanted to bring the sun down to him. Hnh! Arrogance.
DDM00000677	No idea, I was unconscious the whole time.
DDM00000678	I don't remember, only woke up when my Pip-Boy went active.
DDM00000679	Must have already been in the cage... already had the collar in me. You're lucky Dog didn't devour you... otherwise, we'd be closer than we are now.
DDM00000680	Why do you say that?
DDM00000681	I don't remember you... that isn't surprising. What is... is that it was when Dog was out of his cage... free, hungry.
DDM00000682	He knows not to eat anything he catches in the traps... after that, however... so he dragged you here, you got spared.
DDM00000683	Dog must have fed after you arrived... once he was fed, that allowed me out of the cage, and put him inside. Do you remember how long you were out?
DDM00000684	So you know the way back?
DDM00000685	The way back doesn't matter... try to leave, try to disobey, and your collar ends the journey faster than you can say, "begin again."
DDM00000686	You're clever, you'd be able to find a way back if you left the Villa. Dog can... I can find the way back, if "back" is where I even wanted to go.
DDM00000687	Until the Old Man lets you go, you're going nowhere. This beautiful paradise, with all its toxins and death... it's home.
DDM00000688	You brought me here to the Villa.
DDM00000689	Me? You think I want to haul bodies around the wastes like a Brahmin at the whip? No, Dog does it, when the Old Man says fetch, Dog fetches.
DDM00000690	You were in a man-trap, and Dog made his rounds, and dragged you here. When, I don't know. But... it must have been... recent. Before the cage.
DDM00000691	This Old Man, what do you know about him?
DDM00000692	Elijah. Human, weak like all of you are. Feeling age circling him like starved dogs, howling for blood.
DDM00000693	To me, he reeks of age and failure. And madness. To me, he is simply the "Old Man." To Dog, he is "Master." His name, meaningless.
DDM00000694	Running out of years, hopes and dreams running through his withered hands like sand from the Big Empty... and scorched by the sun.
DDM00000695	Why do you say I'm the same as the Old Man?
DDM00000696	You're not him anymore than I'm Dog. But that collar around your neck...
DDM00000697	...you're an extension of the Old Man's grasp, clumsy, perhaps, but a tool, yes. And once you get acclimated to the Sierra Madre...
DDM00000698	...then you'll feel the same overpowering hunger the Old Man does. And then you'll be him, not just his hand.
DDM00000699	Do you know how I got here?
DDM00000700	Of course I know. Even if I don't see it happen - down in the cage, I hear echoes of the footfalls, the click of the collars.
DDM00000701	Every time I see one of you, I know exactly how you got here - you couldn't help yourselves, anymore than Dog can help himself.
DDM00000702	You heard the voice, the promise, and then you walked right into one of the Old Man's traps. Then... then Dog comes for you, drags you here.
DDM00000703	Forget it. I had other questions.
DDM00000704	Maybe you shouldn't go around shoving Old World tech in your stomach.
DDM00000705	As if I had a choice. Sometimes instinct takes over, and that's when I go into the cage. It's like curiosity that way.
DDM00000706	After all, you wouldn't have put that collar on by choice... perhaps it was your curiosity that caused that hand to close on your neck.
DDM00000707	How the hell did you... or whoever... eat one of these collars?
DDM00000708	They... detach. When segmented, they look like nothing more than metallic Radscorpions... and if they're attached to neck flesh, warm, red...
DDM00000709	Dog doesn't care what's on the body he's crushing in his hands, he'll mangle it, twist it, make it fit until he's full.
DDM00000710	Dog can't help himself... hungry... greedy. And now the collar's inside, alive again. And we're trapped here until it goes cold.
DDM00000711	If that collar inside you is active, I didn't switch it on.
DDM00000712	Really. Yet it led you here, to me. And now you're here, and it's burning a hole in my guts. Maybe it's crying for its owner.
DDM00000713	If you weren't expecting me, who were you waiting for?
DDM00000714	Don't play stupid, I already have to mind one child. You must have figured it out by now.
DDM00000715	The Old Man obsessed with the Sierra Madre... riddled with greed. Hoped you might be him when I woke up. All you are is his hand...
DDM00000716	...you're the same kind of greed. Followed the radio, the broadcast, and now you're here, all confused. Not for long. You'll figure it out.
DDM00000717	I need to get you out of there.
DDM00000718	No... no, I don't think so. Even in here, I have more control than you do.
DDM00000719	I'm not leaving until the one who controls the collars shows... not his voice, not his hand, not his lackey... him.
DDM00000720	And when he comes to see me, we'll settle things. So go on, go back to your master, tell him I'm waiting for him. Dog may follow him - I won't.
DDM00000721	Why did you lock yourself in the cage?
DDM00000722	No... why did I lock him in the cage. I locked him in because I could feel him... getting hungry again. There wasn't much time.
DDM00000723	If Dog roams, he gets into trouble... eats things he shouldn't, listens to others he shouldn't... so he's safer in here. We're safer in here.
DDM00000724	I hoped if I locked him in here... the one he obeys would come for him. Instead, I get you.
DDM00000725	I was looking for someone with a collar like mine. Where is your collar?
DDM00000726	It's close. Closer than I'd like... Dog's been into things, needs to think before he eats, chew before he swallows. He's... eager that way.
DDM00000727	Now the collar's a part of me. Inside. I can feel its electronic heartbeat, clicking and burning down below... like before.
DDM00000728	It was cold and heavy before going in the cage... now you're here, and it's pulling and kicking again, tugging like a leash. Interesting.
DDM00000729	I can't leave until we get through this.
DDM00000730	Of course you can't. This cage is locked tight... from you and the Old Man.
DDM00000731	Sounds like Dog might be more willing to get out of the cage than you.
DDM00000732	Something tells me I could walk Dog through unlocking a door.
DDM00000733	So Dog could just open the door at any time?
DDM00000734	Wait, the casino already opened?
DDM00000735	So the Gala Event was triggered at least once?
DDM00000736	Uh-huh. Master ordered it. "Take places." Then... Master went away. Left Dog... Dog in cage.
DDM00000737	Casino open long time ago, not sure when... voice keeps putting Dog in cage. Haven't seen Master since, only hear voice on your arm and from walls.
DDM00000738	Um... do you want to talk about it?
DDM00000739	[SUCCEEDED] The lights were pretty. In the sky. Pointed at casino. And the casino opened up.
DDM00000740	Dog, think back to the lights, the pretty ones.
DDM00000741	[FAILED] Uh-uh. Dog... Dog wants to stop talking now.
DDM00000742	This is important - do you remember what happened exactly?
DDM00000743	Dog can't remember. Don't want to go, can't make him stay there.
DDM00000744	Dog, do you know why you have to go to the position on this map?
DDM00000745	We need to get you to the Gala Event. Get you to your place.
DDM00000746	Dog... Dog has heard that before. Was there pretty lights? There... were things to pull? Hard to pull, but Dog did. And... a cage.
DDM00000747	...and Dog was hungry there. Dog... was someone else there, with Dog. Then... then there was noise, then... lights... and streets... screamed.
DDM00000748	...Dog doesn't want to go to cage. It's inside Dog now, Dog can see the cage, hear the noises. The way to casino... it'll hurt you. Inside.
DDM00000749	I guess... the alarm outside sure is a racket, though.
DDM00000750	[SUCCEEDED] Very good. Yes... it's another layer of white noise to ensure privacy. Unfortunately, it's also acted as a dinner bell for the residents.
DDM00000751	As long as the holographic greeter outside is active, however, I can get by them... the Holograms fascinate them. Ghost-worship, perhaps.
DDM00000752	You're blocking the eavesdropping with the alarm outside, too. Nice.
DDM00000753	[FAILED] Yes... interesting that. More like a dinner bell to some.

DDM00000755	If I can't prove it to you, then forget this, I'm bringing Dog out.
DDM00000756	That's enough for now.
DDM00000757	Hnnh-hnn.
DDM00000758	Yes, Master.
DDM00000759	Nnnh-Hnnn.
DDM00000760	I need you to stay here and trigger the switches.
DDM00000761	Dog doesn't understand... too hungry, hard to hear words... Master, when can Dog feed.
DDM00000762	If Dog was fed like last time, Dog would listen. If the feeding was quiet.
DDM00000763	Maybe voice could make Dog stay, Dog not want to be in cage, Dog want to be free, find Master.
DDM00000764	Nnnh... getting tired of hearing your orders. Dog's clawing at the cage, hungrier than usual.
DDM00000765	You must need something, I can see it in your eyes. The Gala... of course. How could I forget?
DDM00000766	If you want me to... heel... if you want Dog to obey, then he'll need to be fed, like last time.
DDM00000767	Those scars on your body - where did you get them?
DDM00000768	Hurt self. Hurt makes the voice go away... it doesn't like pain.
DDM00000769	Dog doesn't like pain, either, but keeps voice quiet, so Dog will hurt self until voice dies. Dog hurt self enough, voice go away, never come back.
DDM00000770	Can you tell me how you got to the Sierra Madre?
DDM00000771	Here? Followed voice in air, then here... here as long as can remember. Don't like this place... hard to find things to eat sometimes.
DDM00000772	Better than the cage. Dog doesn't like being locked up. Voice in air didn't say anything about a cage and nothing to eat.
DDM00000773	Do you know how to wake him up?
DDM00000774	Sometimes when Dog gets tired. Or eats too much, gets full. Sometimes... when Dog goes to the cage... then voice wakes up.
DDM00000775	The voice locks Dog in when it comes up, always trying to keep Dog from food. Voice did it at the cage where you found me. Then Master came.
DDM00000776	What's the other voice?
DDM00000777	Other voice... don't wake him up. When voice wakes up, Dog goes to sleep and voice climbs up in Dog's head.
DDM00000778	The voice puts Dog in places... puts him in cages and locks him in.
DDM00000779	Where's your collar?
DDM00000780	Lost it. Got hungry. Made the other voice mad, madder than it ever was, mad enough to lock Dog up.
DDM00000781	I want to hear more about the Master.
DDM00000782	He takes care of Dog. He tells Dog what to do. Told Dog to come here, put collars on people.
DDM00000783	Sometimes people fight. Dog holds them until they go quiet, don't make any noise. If collars don't fit or go too quiet... find others for Master.
DDM00000784	Master makes the other voice go away - the other voice hates Master, Dog can feel it. Master's voice is like pain, protects Dog.
DDM00000785	Sounds like good trade.
DDM00000786	Master always feed Dog if not in cage. Master lets Dog do what Dog wants. Not like other voice in cage. Always mad with Dog, shouting at him.
DDM00000787	Where does the voice come from?
DDM00000788	Don't know where other voice come from. Wish would go away. Always trying to stop Dog, caging Dog.
DDM00000789	Voice started talking not long ago, Dog think... was always there. Start talking when Master showed up? Making Dog sleep, go to cage.
DDM00000790	Voice hates Master. It okay... voice always hide when Master around, go quiet, watch Master as he does things. Voice scared of Master, Dog thinks.
DDM00000791	Sound nice. It still there?
DDM00000792	Where Church now?
DDM00000793	Maybe you go back someday.
DDM00000794	All gone. All gone. It better now that found new Master.
DDM00000795	New Master tells Dog what to do, rewards Dog, like old Master. Dog goes get people, drag them here... like vat. Dog knows how to do that.
DDM00000796	If people fight, Dog hit them until they stop. And if more than one, Dog can eat them, so Dog hunts hard for as many as he can find.
DDM00000797	Must been hard to see you.
DDM00000798	Why you want to look like ground?
DDM00000799	When put it on, hard to see. Hard to see... Dog was told not to be seen then. Same as now, except different.
DDM00000800	Dog and others... had to hide in Base. And Church. The Master was there. Master was... spoke like many people. Smart. Like Lou-Lieutenant.
DDM00000801	Dog misses the Church. When got dark, no people, Dog could sit on floor and look up at ceiling. Could... take off wrist-collar then.
DDM00000802	Nuh-uh!
DDM00000803	Is true. Dog wore it right on his hand, where bear trap is now... he thinks.
DDM00000804	I had other questions for you.
DDM00000805	More? Don't push your luck.
DDM00000806	You're a brave one. Sure you're ready for the answers?
DDM00000807	What do you eat?
DDM00000808	Dog eats whatever he can catch. Sometimes they run, but Dog is strong, moves fast.
DDM00000809	Sometimes... makes voice mad when I eat... Master doesn't mind.
DDM00000810	Voice in the air?
DDM00000811	Dog hears many voices... one in air. The... other one. And Master. Master is the nicest. Gets mean, mad sometimes. But lets Dog feed.
DDM00000812	Master was quiet for a long time until Dog heard him on your arm... did you eat him? Dog gets hungry, too. Being hungry makes the voice... mad.
DDM00000813	Don't like it here, either.
DDM00000814	Me hear voice, too? Then got here, bad place.
DDM00000815	Dog trapped here, too. This place not like West. Air like copper wire. Gut heavy, hurts, beeps sometimes.
DDM00000816	Back West... in bone cities... Dog wore a collar on wrist, turned him into color of ground, turned him into color of sky.
DDM00000817	I had other questions for you.
DDM00000818	Dog is getting tired, Master. When can Dog eat?
DDM00000819	Too much talking makes Dog's head hurt. Getting hungry.
DDM00000820	Can you tell me about the voice?
DDM00000821	Your name is carved on your chest. Is that part of it?
DDM00000822	Yes... no... don't know what the word means, everyone says the same, except the voice. The voice says it backward.
DDM00000823	Is that why you have a bear trap locked on your arm?
DDM00000824	Dog put his hand in it, hurts. Made the voice go away, now can't get it off. Don't want it off, hurt keeps voice sleeping... bleeding.
DDM00000825	It also keeps others quiet, too. Dog hits them with metal bear teeth until their voices stop, makes Master's voice come back.
DDM00000826	<Lie> Just... stay here in the courtyard, I'll go get food.
DDM00000827	All right... for a moment there, I thought... hnh. I'll wait here then, come back when you've found a carcass. Or three.
DDM00000828	If I bring food, will that calm Dog down?
DDM00000829	It always does... makes him sleepier. Weaker. Easier to keep out of trouble. As for the type of food...
DDM00000830	Make sure it isn't struggling, if you can. It's hard enough to choke down half of what I suspect he eats. And make sure it's not a bomb collar.
DDM00000831	Yeah, well, I'll make Dog help me. Can't be hard to figure all this wire stuff out.
DDM00000832	[SUCCEEDED] You think you can figure out what to... hnh. Of course you can.
DDM00000833	I'll stand at my post. Once you trigger the event... well, we'll see who makes it to the Sierra Madre.
DDM00000834	If that diagram over there holds the details, I can walk Dog through the instructions.
DDM00000835	[FAILED] No... you can barely give me instructions, let alone order Dog. Bark your orders somewhere else.
DDM00000836	Have orders for you - for going, staying, all that.
DDM00000837	Dog is listening.
DDM00000838	The Master sounds like he treats you well.
DDM00000839	Could I find my way back?
DDM00000840	Maybe. Not sure you could find way back once leave. Dog has to smell and hunt for path back here sometimes... Cloud keep moving.
DDM00000841	It okay... no one ever leave except Dog... and Dog not want to leave. You here until Master lets you go.
DDM00000842	Do you know the way back?
DDM00000843	Might find way back if Master lets you go. If he not want you to go, he makes head red spray. Then Dog has to find another one.
DDM00000844	To leave...? Go through gate, walk. Hard to find way, Dog can do it, too hard for most to come here. Why so quiet in streets.
DDM00000845	Did you bring me here?
DDM00000846	Dog fetches. Dragged you here... Dog thinks. You not struggle like others. Trap makes you sleep, make your voice go to cage.
DDM00000847	Dog doing what he was told. Tried to catch as many as he can, can eat the others.
DDM00000848	No eat you, though. Master talk through you, like voice inside Dog. Dog missed hearing Master, not hear Master for long time.
DDM00000849	Can you tell me about the other voice inside you?
DDM00000850	Can you tell me more about the Gala Event going off?
DDM00000851	Do you know how long ago?
DDM00000852	If the casino already opened, what are we doing here?
DDM00000853	Don't know. Dog keep bringing people here.
DDM00000854	So Master vanished around that time.
DDM00000855	Master went away until you show up with him on your arm.
DDM00000856	Dog, do you know why you have to go to the position on the map?
DDM00000857	Hard to pull things...? Dog has to pull very, very hard to... are we going there?
DDM00000858	Dog not want to stay and pull things... hard to do... and cage there.
DDM00000859	What does Dog know?
DDM00000860	Ask him. Or better, don't. It wouldn't be an interesting conversation, much like this one.
DDM00000861	What's Elijah doing here?
DDM00000862	Heard the call of the Sierra Madre, just like you did... exactly the same way.
DDM00000863	Finds out it's more than a story, comes to this shining poisonous grail, this jewel of the desert.
DDM00000864	Dog knows him more than I do. Dog's always nodding, always obeying him, because he's weak and hungry and greedy for master's affection.
DDM00000865	I want to know more about the man who brought us here.
DDM00000866	Where is your collar?
DDM00000867	Did getting hit in the head cause you to start acting this way?
DDM00000868	[SUCCEEDED] Trauma... yes, in a manner of speaking.
DDM00000869	You have multiple personality disorder. Some trauma caused this?
DDM00000870	[FAILED] No... sometimes it simply wakes voices up.
DDM00000871	Why can't you control him?
DDM00000872	The instinct is stronger than me. Dog is stronger than me. He's just a child... he knows when he does wrong, he just can't help himself.
DDM00000873	I don't know when I first spoke, or when I first started thinking for myself, it was so long ago. I... slept for a long time... before...
DDM00000874	...I want to believe I was the one in control. Once. I don't know anymore. Then Dog got a new Master. A new voice. And I woke up, to protect him.
DDM00000875	You care about him.
DDM00000876	He's my brother - kin. Without him, I wouldn't exist. Maybe I was nothing more than his conscience, trying to rein him in. Useless.
DDM00000877	I... I just need him to show restraint, let go of the needs, the hungers. Ease the burden... just once, so I can have my thoughts to myself.
DDM00000878	Does not being in control bother you so much?
DDM00000879	[SUCCEEDED] I've watched over Dog for so long. Tried to stop him from... hurting others, killing others, quiet that mindless howling instinct of his.
DDM00000880	He doesn't understand, he has the brain of a child... he knows when he does wrong, he just can't help himself.
DDM00000881	You're trying to protect Dog. Having Elijah control him, hurt him - you want to protect him.
DDM00000882	[FAILED] No... because all I need to do is bide my time. I'll settle this... myself, as I always planned.
DDM00000883	Can't you do anything?
DDM00000884	Do anything? Me... me, Dog puts in the cage, hurts himself to try and drown out my voice, when all I want to do...
DDM00000885	...aah... hrrr, never mind, useless. Finally had to start fighting back, screaming on my own. Had to take matters into my own hands, lock Dog up.
DDM00000886	What does Elijah make Dog do that angers you so much?
DDM00000887	Gather others, drag them here... fetch, like an animal... and hurt them if they resist.
DDM00000888	Dog doesn't even blink, even hear their cries when he's twisted their arms full circle... fragile things, screaming on the ground...
DDM00000889	To listen to him... commanding Dog... to hurt others... and Dog just nods, eager and willing to serve.
DDM00000890	Sounds like it makes you mad.
DDM00000891	Mad? Mad doesn't even begin to describe... there's not a word for the hate I feel inside. It's consuming... twists every thought to red.
DDM00000892	After all that's laid ruin to the world... again and again, I thought at last, we could be free... thought Dog could be free.
DDM00000893	No... no, the world's always got another cage, waiting, keeping everything you want... just out of reach.
DDM00000894	Well... true enough. Sure uses the word "Master" a lot.
DDM00000895	[SUCCEEDED] The "Master" - Elijah... reminds Dog of someone from long ago. His leader, commander. Commanders.
DDM00000896	The Master was a strong personality... personalities as well. Dog is slavish, was conditioned to serve the Master until death.
DDM00000897	The Old Man... Elijah merely came along and opened that door in Dog's mind. Now Dog does whatever the Old Man wants.
DDM00000898	Why did you put emphasis on the word "Master" before?
DDM00000899	[FAILED] Habit. Conditioning. It doesn't matter.
DDM00000900	Why does that make him go away?
DDM00000901	Dog is afraid of me as long as the Master isn't around.
DDM00000902	We need to discuss tactics - and positioning.
DDM00000903	Orders - for me. This should be good.
DDM00000904	How do you switch back and forth between voices?
DDM00000905	All it takes is the right... command. Whenever Dog hears the... his Master giving orders, I go back in the cage.
DDM00000906	So that leash on your wrist... and the one on your neck. I won't truly be free to... express myself until every trace of that voice is destroyed.
DDM00000907	Still... if you ever want to speak to me, bark my audio log at him, the one in the police station. That'll call me out.
DDM00000908	He can't have possibly have set up a deadman's switch like that.
DDM00000909	Really. As much hatred as I hold for him, he is much, much smarter than many I've met... no offense meant, of course.
DDM00000910	He seems to not only understand the workings of Pre-War tech, he seems to breathe it. And... these collars, commandeering your Pip-Boy...
DDM00000911	Are the marks of someone who makes mistakes - but he's not leaving much to chance when it comes to ensuring our compliance.
DDM00000912	Then how are the collars active again?
DDM00000913	[SUCCEEDED] Interesting... so it seems you have another link we don't. And... you're to blame for this.
DDM00000914	Yes... he wears a Pip-Boy on his wrist, just as you do. If he's feeding commands and signals, then I would be careful.
DDM00000915	He's most likely installed a contingency switch in the Pip-Boy. If the signal gets cut off, or you try and remove it... well, then we'll all die.
DDM00000916	The Pip-Boy could boost the signal. If Elijah has a Pip-Boy, that would explain it.
DDM00000917	[FAILED] That I don't know. The collars came back to life... I'm not sure how.
DDM00000918	I felt it when you woke me up... that kicking in my gut, the collar was coiled with a charge again, like a snake.
DDM00000919	What are you talking about?
DDM00000920	Ask Dog. It doesn't matter... it's in the past, as much as I try to forget it, it's always... with us.
DDM00000921	So what happened then?
DDM00000922	Dog happened. When the collars came off... he got... hungry. And all my work, all my effort... wasted because of his hunger, his greed.
DDM00000923	Does the casino block the signal?
DDM00000924	It should have... the casino's construction is unusual. Signals in there get... scrambled, some alloy in the architecture... I don't know.
DDM00000925	I wasn't sure until the collars de-activated that I had won. Trapped him in his cage. Dog... I... could be free.
DDM00000926	Couldn't he have commanded you to rescue him?
DDM00000927	No... I saw to that...
DDM00000928	If he got trapped, why didn't he set off the collars?
DDM00000929	Because he couldn't. As soon as he made his way into the casino, it sealed up...
DDM00000930	...and the casino's construction allowed me an opportunity to escape. The collars... unhooked. I... was free.
DDM00000931	If the casino opened up, then why are we here?
DDM00000932	Because something got left inside. The Old Man... Elijah.
DDM00000933	He's trapped in there. As I hoped he would be.
DDM00000934	He said the casino opened up.
DDM00000935	Very good. As for the casino... yes, it did.
DDM00000936	Something about lights and colors, not much else.
DDM00000937	There was more. Only he truly recalls, though... and should. I won't spoil it for you, especially when we have more... pressing matters.
DDM00000938	Dog said he triggered the Gala Event once already.
DDM00000939	He did, yes. A team did, with collars linked just like yours. Did he tell you everything, or just about the pretty lights?
DDM00000940	Do you know anything else?
DDM00000941	Dog might know more, you should ask him. Beware the answer, because I think Dog got hungry, he couldn't help himself.
DDM00000942	I tried, I always try, and he... he keeps giving in.
DDM00000943	What do you know about the Gala Event?
DDM00000944	The Gala Event is the way to bring the Old Man out. He won't show himself until the casino doors are open.
DDM00000945	So triggering the Event is key... and the key. The question becomes... can we trust each other to do this? We'll see.
DDM00000946	If we go there, you'll have to give me control. If you bring Dog out, then... I'll make sure you pay in blood.
DDM00000947	I heard electricity and radios can cause, uh, voices in people's heads.
DDM00000948	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... Hrrr... That's the easy explanation, the one humans use. Pre-War technology, as if it's the cause of all ills, mind and body.
DDM00000949	I needed to come out of the cage to protect Dog. From clever humans... like you.
DDM00000950	In Super Mutants, brain damage is usually the result of prolonged Stealth Boy usage.
DDM00000951	[FAILED] Perhaps. Or maybe I was here all the time, watching. Waiting for you.
DDM00000952	Any reason why you're assigned to this point on the map?
DDM00000953	Maybe it's familiar, comfortable. Practice makes perfect.
DDM00000954	And as much as it bruises my ego, some things require... brute strength. In the right combination.
DDM00000955	Besides, none of your assembled band of thieves look able to rip a 200 year rusted power switch down like a machete to fire up an entire town.
DDM00000956	I don't know what you're talking about.
DDM00000957	[She sighs silently, then shakes her head and motions to the West.]
DDM00000958	I... can only type with two fingers?
DDM00000959	[SUCCEEDED] [She slowly nods, looks impressed.]
DDM00000960	Neither Dean or Dog have the technical aptitude to man the Switching Station?
DDM00000961	[FAILED] [She sighs silently, then shakes her head and motions to the West.]
DDM00000962	Why do you think he wants you to go the Puesta del Sol Switching Station?
DDM00000963	[She frowns, then makes a motion as if typing at keys... then she points at you, raises her left wrist and pantomimes talking into it.]
DDM00000964	[She points at you, then her, looks right and left, raises two fingers, tries to type, pauses, and slowly shakes her head.]
DDM00000965	You sure seem eager to go.
DDM00000966	[She points at the Fountain, then at your Pip-Boy... pauses, then points at her collar, then yours.]
DDM00000967	[She encircles her throat with her hand, then slowly releases it. Then she motions again to the West.]
DDM00000968	<Wait.>
DDM00000969	No worries, I'll just stand here like a piece of furniture until you're done.
DDM00000970	Careful, that's my arm, all right?
DDM00000971	[Her finger stabs through the red buttons, narrowing in on the local map. She scrolls to the Sierra Madre's main gate, frowns, backs out.]
DDM00000972	[She calls up the local map of the Puesta del Sol Switching Station, zooms in. Her intent expression loses some of its edge as she notes the marker.]
DDM00000973	[She looks up at you, points at marker on your Pip-Boy, points West and tilts her head.]
DDM00000974	I had to get shot in the face for this. Get your own!
DDM00000975	I don't want you messing with this.
DDM00000976	[Christine snarls, makes a dismissive wave, and goes back to studying the Fountain intently - then looks at the casino, then the Fountain again.]
DDM00000977	What? What do you want?
DDM00000978	[She frowns, and snaps her fingers at your Pip-Boy.]
DDM00000979	No fucking way am I giving this to you.
DDM00000980	<Show her the Pip-Boy.>
DDM00000981	[Christine studies the Pip-Boy intently, turning your arm around as if your wrist's a sensor module she just found.]
DDM00000982	[She doesn't seem interested in the screen - she studies the exterior, then the casing. She seems to be making sure it's intact.]
DDM00000983	He leaves audio logs, too.
DDM00000984	[Christine holds out her hand, and motions at your Pip-Boy.]
DDM00000985	We need to trigger the event like he says.
DDM00000986	That's the hologram projector in the Fountain. What of it?
DDM00000987	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, and raises her hands, palms facing each other, then rotates in a 180 degree arc and back again.]
DDM00000988	You think he's using the Pip-Boy? To establish the projector connection?
DDM00000989	[FAILED] [She rolls her eyes, opens her mouth to speak, then stops, her face tensing up in frustration.]
DDM00000990	What? What is it?
DDM00000991	That's our captor. He likes giving orders.
DDM00000992	[She circles her finger around the Fountain and moves her fingers and thumb together rapidly, as if talking.]
DDM00000993	[She frowns, stops moving her hand, then points at the Pip-Boy at your wrist.]
DDM00000994	You make a pretty lousy transmitter, you know.
DDM00000995	[She glares at you. After a second, she pauses, and smiles slightly, shaking her head. She then makes a circle of the skyline with her finger.]
DDM00000996	He'd have to be broadcasting from somewhere nearby.
DDM00000997	Think he might be close, then. Any idea where?
DDM00000998	[She surveys the area, focusing upwards. She glances at the casino, frowns. She then looks West, then East.]
DDM00000999	She's been broadcasting all this time?
DDM00001000	The bombs fell, and the emergency signal went out.
DDM00001001	So... it's not an invitation, it's a call for help.
DDM00001002	Yeah. The Sierra Madre's last song, one only a few people are ever going to hear. A little sad, but what can you do?
DDM00001003	What do you mean about the Sierra Madre broadcast?
DDM00001004	Well, Vera's beautiful voice doesn't run on casino power, exactly. Her broadcast is tied into the emergency broadcast signal for the Sierra Madre.
DDM00001005	You know, in case of attack? Well, guess what - the night of the Gala Event, the emergency signal went out all right.
DDM00001006	But because the broadcast had been hooked up to the Gala Event, instead of an emergency signal, you get Vera's voice on the radio. Great, huh?
DDM00001007	Why would security shut down for the Gala?
DDM00001008	How is the Gala tied to the casino? That makes no sense.
DDM00001009	The Gala Event's tied into the casino's generators?
DDM00001010	Right, look - so, not everything about the Villa was the pinnacle of bright ideas.
DDM00001011	In order to pull off the Gala, old Sinclair had to get creative... the Sierra Madre announcement, for example. Not just for the casino, not at all.
DDM00001012	The Gala's tied to the casino, draws on its power. Might cause it to reset itself, open the doors for a bit like it was supposed to.
DDM00001013	Any advice to getting through this?
DDM00001014	Well... considering my life's on the line, too, yeah, a few things.
DDM00001015	First off, keep everyone together. Keep checking behind you, make sure your partners are following... don't let them wander.
DDM00001016	Also, don't go running crazy everywhere. Almost every inch of this town is lethal. So if you're not sure, take it real slow.
DDM00001017	And speaking of slow, don't go shouting, or attracting attention. Go quiet. The Ghost People find you, it's over.
DDM00001018	What happened to the people who came to the Villa?
DDM00001019	Dead. Either got killed by one of the Villa's attractions, locals, or the beautiful weather.
DDM00001020	Can tell you right now - they didn't stick close to each other, and when they did, they let down their guard at the wrong moment.
DDM00001021	Some left signposts to others, trying to help them out - just led to them getting killed by someone a little more greedy than they were.
DDM00001022	So the visitors all killed each other?
DDM00001023	Sure. First, they figure they can get out, escape. Then they start thinking it over, start thinking about how they can have it all.
DDM00001024	They start weighing the odds, taking risks... and then taking each other out. Bomb collars or not.
DDM00001025	Although... it's odd, the bomb collars weren't linked before like they are now. Guess someone learned what the problem was.
DDM00001026	I found some medical records in the Villa Clinic. You brought her in for treatment, right?
DDM00001027	The Clinic? Yeah, I did bring her in. Before the Gala... well, before the first Gala Event. A few lifetimes ago.
DDM00001028	She was a stress case, throat was shot, all nerves. When she wasn't doped up on Med-X or Superstimming her pain away...
DDM00001029	...look, never mind. I don't want to speak bad about her. She was a classy woman, good singer, and if she couldn't act her way out of a box...
DDM00001030	...she was Sinclair's world, and that's all that mattered. He didn't need to know any of that, any of her history.
DDM00001031	So you met her before she met Sinclair?
DDM00001032	Introductions? You knew her before?
DDM00001033	Of course. What, some kind of surprise to you that I knew people once? Used to have my name in lights, all right?
DDM00001034	Knew a dozen Veras, or whatever her name was. Uh... "Vera Keyes." Figured I could pay Sinclair back, introduce the two...
DDM00001035	...guy was a slouch in the dame department, had to pick up the slack somehow.
DDM00001036	Can you tell me about her?
DDM00001037	Vera was a big star, back before the Bomb. Not the best actress, but... well, she had other talents. Nice voice, nice legs.
DDM00001038	For some reason, Sinclair... he built this place... she caught his eye. Once he was hooked, that was it, had to have her.
DDM00001039	So made the introductions, and guess what? He builds this place for her, like some kind of Cleopatra obsession. Wasn't always a deathtrap.
DDM00001040	Before, you mentioned the Hologram at the Fountain - Vera? Do you know her?
DDM00001041	What happens during the Gala Event?
DDM00001042	Oh, it'll light up the casino, light up the sky... set the speakers in the Villa to play beautiful, soothing music.
DDM00001043	...and when I say soothing music, I mean with the speakers being the state they are, things'll be screaming, all right. Think air raid sirens.
DDM00001044	That means it'll wake up everything in town like a hornet's nest. Not sure what a hornet is? Forget it - basically, trouble.
DDM00001045	Interesting? Interesting how?
DDM00001046	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... maybe the drain in power, that'll cause the security systems to shut down enough to let us in. But... getting back out?
DDM00001047	No, the place'll close up tighter than an opening at the Fronds. Or Danny Parker's sphincter when he has to tip a doorman.
DDM00001048	Why... it sure is interesting. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
DDM00001049	[FAILED] Interesting... in the sense that having some light show open the Sierra Madre? Interesting to me, who would have thought?
DDM00001050	And the woman? The Auto-Doc victim - what about her?
DDM00001051	Little Miss Silence...? Maybe she needs to be in some place where she can be seen, but being heard isn't important?
DDM00001052	What about Christine?
DDM00001053	Christine, that her name? Nice name. I mean, you can't see it on posters, but... never mind.
DDM00001054	I don't know. She might need to hold some place where speaking isn't important. Like stage tech? Lighting? Got me.
DDM00001055	And me? I've had prime billing in Europe, New York... and this gig doesn't feel like that.
DDM00001056	Don't get me wrong, I can hold an audience, conduct a score from the rooftops, but I'm guessing I'm the odd man out in this whole heist.
DDM00001057	Any idea why he wants you there?
DDM00001058	Partner, I'm not sure this guy's operating with a full deck. My bet? Process of elimination, lowest common denominator.
DDM00001059	He figures the "Strong Man"'s needed somewhere, even if it sounds like the Strong Man's two minds about it.
DDM00001060	Plus, I'm guessing wherever ol' Doggy Boy's needed doesn't need smarts. I hope not, or we're royally jones'd.
DDM00001061	According to the marker, you're slated for a spot in Puesta del Sol.
DDM00001062	No... looks like a rooftop in Puesta del Sol. In better days, nice view. Now? It's the last place anyone wants to stand when this event goes off.
DDM00001063	That place during Spring, Summer, and Fall, a little bit in Winter, is a prime resort spot for Ghost People. Not the best of neighborhoods.
DDM00001064	If we're going there, I'm not going alone. And if you have any bright ideas about telling me to stroll over there - or leave me there? No thanks.
DDM00001065	"Vera" Hologram? You know the holographic woman?
DDM00001066	Yeah - don't you? Or... guess Vera Keyes got lost along with the rest of the holo-archives when the bomb hit, huh?
DDM00001067	Ghost in name and image. Still a looker, though. Got to hand it to Sinclair, sure can pick 'em. Well, or get picked. Whichever.
DDM00001068	Know anything about this Gala Event we're supposed to trigger?
DDM00001069	Supposed to be the Grand Opening of the Sierra Madre. Lot of lights, music, the works.
DDM00001070	And he's going to use the Gala Event... to open the casino? But... that's... interesting.
DDM00001071	Can't take any chances, though... you may be some victim who simply stumbled down here. If so, can't let you let Dog out... no, not yet.
DDM00001072	If you're who I think you are, you came to fetch Dog, use him to drag others here. Now I'll use you - and that Pip-Boy you're wearing.
DDM00001073	You're smart. Clever. The key to Dog's cage is simple. Take my voice to the cage above. Let me speak to the beast inside.
DDM00001074	Then you and I... we can talk.
DDM00001075	That's it... signal frequency's hot, let's see how you deal with this.
DDM00001076	Switching frequency, asshole.
DDM00001077	Switching frequency, bitch.
DDM00001078	Need to reset this damn thing... switching the frequencies... come on, come on...
DDM00001079	Resetting signal... resetting signal.
DDM00001080	Think you can run? The longer you try and keep your distance, this scanning frequency will flush you out.
DDM00001081	Seeing what I can do to shut those turrets down from up here... come on... come on...
DDM00001082	...got it, two of 'em down... can't shut down the others - he's cut off access. Dammit! Put him down, bury him - whatever it takes!
DDM00001083	Is... is this thing on? You hear me down there? Trying to help you out here... disable the speakers, play a little music...
DDM00001084	...and that's more like it, got a beat you can swing to. And they won't set off your collar any more - just hit that guy where it hurts.
DDM00001085	You think you've escaped?! You can't outrun me, you were always under my control! Do you hear me?! Do you hear me?!
DDM00001086	You won't get out. I'll bring the whole Sierra Madre down on you, bury you here with all the others.
DDM00001087	Think you can escape? No, that hand on your throat is mine, always was.
DDM00001088	Hey, those are my emergency supplies! Uh... I-I mean... I know we're in a bad spot here... just, uh, leave me something, all right?
DDM00001089	Yeah, go on... help yourself. Why not?
DDM00001090	Leave me something, will you?
DDM00001091	Never should have left those stupid handprints. Dead giveaway.
DDM00001092	Gala
DDM00001093	END MUSIC 
DDM00001094	I'm not following you.
DDM00001095	Odd Man out... dead weight. Someone you need holding the toolbox, the nurse passing the scalpel, the chauffer driving you to the concert.
DDM00001096	Any guy with hands is who he needs up on that rooftop. Guess he thinks I don't rate, looking like I do. Poor him.
DDM00001097	Is there one console that runs them or several?
DDM00001098	Keep going. What else?
DDM00001099	That's the radios and speakers - what about a central sound system?
DDM00001100	The speakers are all controlled by a central console. It's the farthest from the only door out of here...
DDM00001101	...so you'd need to do a full circuit of the corridor to get to it. Once there, you'll need to shut it down, and I don't have the code.
DDM00001102	If you have the code, you can turn off all the speakers, make them settle down. Getting backstage should buy us time, just take it slow.
DDM00001103	Good thing you mentioned that before I ran back there, "partner."
DDM00001104	Look, I'm in danger here, all right, not exactly thinking with a level head, so cut me some slack. Please.
DDM00001105	One problem at a time. Take a breath, try and remember.
DDM00001106	Calm down, think. Do you know specifically where?
DDM00001107	Uh... let's see. Um, once you break right, watch each turn in the corridor, one'll be on your right past my dressing room - and up.
DDM00001108	Oh, my dressing room - may have left the radio on, right by the table... uh, if you could just shut it off instead of blowing it u... uh, never mind.
DDM00001109	And there was a speaker in the prop room, too - on the wall between the entrances. And... well, walk slow - there's bound to be more.
DDM00001110	What about the speakers in here?
DDM00001111	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... yeah, so what? We got bigger problems with the Holograms... no, no, wait, you're right.
DDM00001112	The Theater piped music and sound backstage, which means those little squealers are in the corridors back there, too.
DDM00001113	Dean, the theater speakers are wired to a central sound system, right?
DDM00001114	[FAILED] What about them? The speakers won't kill you if you leave them alone, don't worry about them, just get backstage.
DDM00001115	This casino's security system is pissing me off.
DDM00001116	You are preaching to the choir. Sinclair and his security... don't even get me started. Those Holograms...
DDM00001117	Uh... anything else you can tell me that'd help? Anything?
DDM00001118	[SUCCEEDED] Uh... right. Uh... let's see... when you get the door open, there'll be an exit door dead ahead. Don't take it.
DDM00001119	It's most likely filled with toxins from the vents. So hug the wall, make as much space between you and the door... or it's Cloud Nine in a casket.
DDM00001120	Past that... is my dressing room. Under the table there's a footlocker. It's tucked back a bit, so you might miss it. Inside, a gun, some ammo.
DDM00001121	Not much help against the ghosts, still, if you're about to give up, call it quits? Throw it to me so I can eat a bullet first.
DDM00001122	I need a little more than that to go on if we're going to break out of here.
DDM00001123	[FAILED] Anything else? I've told you all I can think of! Now, come on, get going.
DDM00001124	All right, I'll head for the door on the left.
DDM00001125	Good, go, and don't get yourself killed - do that, and we're both done.
DDM00001126	All right, I'll break to my right, head for the locked door.
DDM00001127	Good, go, and don't get yourself killed - do that, and we're both done.
DDM00001128	Look... just get rid of them, all right? Tried to slip off stage, then they all started changing color and raising their hands... not a good sign.
DDM00001129	So how do I get you out of there?
DDM00001130	Trust me - as soon as you can, run to the door to the left - use the key you got out of the music rag there, and camp out.
DDM00001131	As bad as things are, it's going to get a lot worse if either of us pops - so get backstage... until we get a better plan.
DDM00001132	I didn't see any security coming in - only the speakers.
DDM00001133	Wait, what Holograms? What are you talking about?
DDM00001134	Look... those ghosts are going to come out of the wings behind you in a second, the security types, not the "friendly" bald types.
DDM00001135	And if you got in here, the door's probably locked tight behind you - so don't back up or run for the exit, you're not going to make it.
DDM00001136	All right, makes sense. Where's the music?
DDM00001137	The Holotape should be where I left it... no, wait. It's... it's in Vera's dressing room, probably. May... may be a key to her room on my desk.
DDM00001138	Anyway... snag the key out of my room, and look around Vera's room, the Holotape has to be there. As for getting it to the projection booth...
DDM00001139	Well... sometimes Vera used to watch from the projection booth, so she must have had a master key... look around her room, might be there.
DDM00001140	Yeah, but if I run, what about the Security Holograms?
DDM00001141	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... yeah, right. So... let's see... security's here because the show hasn't started. Guests aren't allowed in, so...
DDM00001142	...guess we need to start the show. Okay... so when they were setting this place up... we had rehearsals...
DDM00001143	...and heh... Sinclair even set up hologram recordings of the shows so we could watch and critique our performances before a fake audience. Whatever.
DDM00001144	Thing is, when the recording queued up, a nice, calm, appreciative audience appeared in the Theater - no security with their head-blasting zap rays.
DDM00001145	So, find the music, get it to the projector room upstairs, then play it...? Might reset security, worth a shot.
DDM00001146	Getting backstage is a temporary measure if I can't find the security terminal.
DDM00001147	[FAILED] One thing at a time - and buying time is what we need, all right? Think in the now, it'll sort itself out. I hope.
DDM00001148	So I go to the locked door, right?
DDM00001149	[SUCCEEDED] What? Oh, my left - your right. So, yeah, run to the door on your right. Heh, almost got you killed there. Us killed there.
DDM00001150	Wait - I need to head to the door to your left or my left?
DDM00001151	[FAILED] Right, the locked door to the left. Watch out, the guards are going to materialize in any second, crouch and take it slow.
DDM00001152	That's all I wanted to know. I'll head out, see what I can do on my end.
DDM00001153	What were you blackmailing her with?
DDM00001154	What wasn't I blackmailing her with. Chem use, indiscretions, more chem use... the usual Hollywood tune.
DDM00001155	Like Sinclair, people are the architects of their own misfortunes. Leave themselves wide open for someone to waltz right in and take what they want.
DDM00001156	As long as they take a single step into the trap. Get a few pictures, get a little dirt, and that person's your piano.
DDM00001157	Vera? Med-X was her thing, even Superstimmed herself for the after-rush. Sick.
DDM00001158	What did you want her to do?
DDM00001159	Sinclair built this whole town to accommodate her. Same with the casino's voice lock. He wanted to make sure she had access to everything.
DDM00001160	And since I already had access to Vera... well, that meant I had access to the vault, too.
DDM00001161	Were you blackmailing Vera Keyes to break into the Sierra Madre?
DDM00001162	"Blackmail" is such a strong word. I asked her, she said yes, then... she started to get cold feet.
DDM00001163	I blame Sinclair... he was such a victim, that maybe she felt it would be too easy... it doesn't matter.
DDM00001164	I found this Holotape in your safe.
DDM00001165	Yeah? Little bit of two-reel memories... we're here to steal from the Sierra Madre, not from each other.
DDM00001166	Sinclair?! Sinclair, I'm trapped. Please, oh god, the security systems won't let me out, they're keeping me here.
DDM00001167	Sinclair! Sinclair!
DDM00001168	We all pay for what we've done. I'm so sorry, Sinclair. Sorry, I... I should have trusted you.
DDM00001169	I'm going to die here, amongst the ghosts. I... I'm still being recorded by the holographic system.
DDM00001170	The doors, they... they sealed. I... I can hear the other guests, screaming to be let out, to let go.
DDM00001171	Let go? Let go of what?
DDM00001172	I came so far to be here... now, now I just want to leave. Please... let me leave.
DDM00001173	Sinclair? Sinclair, where did you go? Why did you leave me here? Why...
DDM00001174	Sinclair, is that you?
DDM00001175	...would you stop? Such a kidder.
DDM00001176	This is Vera Keyes, auditioning for Love Sets Sail... god, this script. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to have the w...
DDM00001177	...is that a plane over head? Those bombers are nothing but big hornets buzzing around the sky these days...
DDM00001178	...is it gone. All right. This is Vera Keyes, auditioning for "Love Sets Sail."
DDM00001179	"Malcolm... ever since our freighter went down, I feel like my heart's fallen to the bottom of the ocean along with my... ugh"
DDM00001180	...along with my career. God... heh... all right, all right...
DDM00001181	Pretty as a picture.
DDM00001182	Uh... Dean, I... didn't hear you come in.
DDM00001183	I'm not wearing my dancing shoes, so I walk a little softly now. What, you think I was a Chinaman, come to cut your American throat?
DDM00001184	Dean, really.
DDM00001185	What... no hug? Come here.
DDM00001186	Dean, I'm getting ready.
DDM00001187	You sing like a bird, pop the safe, and we're as through as through can be.
DDM00001188	Dean... I just... about tonight, I... I don't know.
DDM00001189	You don't know? I ask one simple favor of you, and you tell me "no?"
DDM00001190	I didn't say no. I just said that... I don't think...
DDM00001191	You're right, you don't think.
DDM00001192	I don't need you - I'll send you back to the farm, worse off than you were, because you'll have seen the Sierra Madre, and had to let it all go.
DDM00001193	I could have gotten any leggy dame out of Hollywood to get out here and play Sinclair's heart strings.
DDM00001194	You just happened to be the one I caught, and it was really your own fault, a little too much into the chems and meds, and...
DDM00001195	Aw, shhh, don't cry. Look, I'm not trying to hurt you. Just one last little job, a little less dirty, a little less messy. He trusts you, Vera.
DDM00001196	And so do I. After this, I promise you, all those other Holotapes, they'll go away.
DDM00001197	Of course, Dean.
DDM00001198	Everyone's still alive on each floor - including you.
DDM00001199	Still trying to find out. Not sure.
DDM00001200	All right... even if they all end up dead, though, you say there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives.
DDM00001201	Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal to tie it all together? Easy. Just a little legwork.
DDM00001202	Christine is dead. Dog... well...
DDM00001203	Dead? For the love of... chopping up her voice box was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
DDM00001204	Still... there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives, right? Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal?
DDM00001205	Christine is alive. Dog... well...
DDM00001206	Forget that walking stomach, not interested in being his lunch... just glad the girl's all right. Where is she? Is she here?
DDM00001207	Wait... no, if the Sierra Madre assigned people to floors, she's got to have been sent to Vera's room, right? That's irony for you.
DDM00001208	Perfect, couldn't have worked out better. So - what, you're heading to the main terminal now that you've got this floor unlocked?
DDM00001209	<Lie> If Christine's throat surgery was your plan, too late, she's dead.
DDM00001210	[SUCCEEDED] Dead? After all I went through... after all that hauling her body through the streets?
DDM00001211	[FAILED] Really... "partner." Now, now... you can't pull one over on Dean... but you tried, didn't you?
DDM00001212	So you don't want to share... keep her from me, huh? All we have to do is make her sing, and it's all ours.
DDM00001213	Although... why lie to me? I'm hurt. I mean, we don't even need her if you get the terminals live, and the music kicking.
DDM00001214	If you were using Christine's voice box to smuggle Vera's voice in, she's dead.
DDM00001215	And here I thought I was being clever. Teach me to hold my cards a little closer to the chest... whole heist was a gamble anyway.
DDM00001216	Still... there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives, right? Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal?
DDM00001217	Wait, you were trying to smuggle one inside? Where is it?
DDM00001218	It's safe. I hope. Right now, let's focus on getting everyone else to safety, all right? Everybody else all right?
DDM00001219	So - what, you're heading to the main terminal now that you've got this floor unlocked?
DDM00001220	Hnh. You got a point. You better not let me down. Try and get into the Sierra Madre without me? You'll wish you hadn't.
DDM00001221	All right... look, if the Holograms are here to keep me company, then... I don't mind staying here for a while.
DDM00001222	But listen... when this thing goes off, try and get into the Sierra Madre without me? You'll wish you hadn't.
DDM00001223	The terminal can tie the fragments together, just need to wrap it up.
DDM00001224	Now that I've got the signal established to this floor, yes.
DDM00001225	All right - well, thanks for bailing me out.
DDM00001226	Yes, that's the next step. You going to be all right?
DDM00001227	I'll be fine, don't worry about me. Go on ahead, I'm going to try and unwind.
DDM00001228	If it means I can get out of this alive, yes, that's why I'm here.
DDM00001229	At least you're honest, can't blame you. I'd have done the same if there was a trigger to my head... or a collar on my neck.
DDM00001230	No - believe it or not, I wasn't going to leave you to die.
DDM00001231	You know... people can still surprise me. All right, I believe you. You got spine. Guess the bombs left a little human goodwill behind.
DDM00001232	The one who put these collars on us wanted me to deal with everyone first.
DDM00001233	Figures... wish he'd show himself, although I'm betting he's not doing that until we've cracked the vault.
DDM00001234	That means we'll still need a copy of the song to get into the vault... and after all I went through to smuggle a copy inside.
DDM00001235	Wait... you said this guy wanted you to deal with all of us first? What, is everyone else here?
DDM00001236	If by "recording inside," you meant Christine, she's dead.
DDM00001237	Figured that out, huh? Clever.
DDM00001238	<Lie> If by "recording inside" you meant Christine, she's dead.
DDM00001239	Dead? For the love of... Chopping up her voice box was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
DDM00001240	Christine is dead. Dog... well...
DDM00001241	Dead? For the love of... this whole heist was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
DDM00001242	Christine is alive. Dog... well...
DDM00001243	Forget that walking stomach, not interested in being his lunch... just glad the girl's all right. Where is she? Is she here?
DDM00001244	Wait... no, if the Sierra Madre assigned people to floors, she's got to have been sent to Vera's room, right? That's irony for you.
DDM00001245	Perfect, couldn't have worked out better.
DDM00001246	Wait - you said you have one inside? Where's the song recording you have?
DDM00001247	It's safe. I hope. Right now, let's focus on getting everyone else to safety, all right? Everybody else all right?
DDM00001248	The one who put these collars on us wanted me to deal with everyone first.
DDM00001249	Figures... wish he'd show himself, although I'm betting he's not doing that until we've cracked the vault.
DDM00001250	That means we'll still need a copy of the song to get into the vault... and after all I went through to smuggle a copy inside.
DDM00001251	Wait... you said this guy wanted you to deal with all of us first? What, is everyone else here?
DDM00001252	<Lie> I'm not sure how to do it yet. You said you had a recording outside?
DDM00001253	Well, yeah in the Villa. But I have one inside, too.
DDM00001254	We can talk about that later, though, it's not important right now... you came for me, any sign of the others?
DDM00001255	The song still exists in fragments in the Sierra Madre archives on each floor.
DDM00001256	Guess Vera echoes down through the ages, then. Sierra Madre hasn't completely forgotten her.
DDM00001257	So that's why you showed... you wanted what was in the music archives on this floor, hook up the signal. Nice.
DDM00001258	As long as I re-establish a frequency to each floor, I can rebuild the song.
DDM00001259	The key is a song by Vera Keyes.
DDM00001260	What? Are you sure? That song... that stupid song of hers... no, that makes perfect sense.
DDM00001261	And it was always playing here in the casino... dammit, if I'd only brought a recording inside... so, what, you're trying to recover it?
DDM00001262	What are you doing with a key to her room?
DDM00001263	Do I have to spell it out? Come on. Time's wasting, and those Holograms are going to be on us any second.
DDM00001264	...got it, two of 'em down... can't shut down the others - he's cut off access. Dammit! Put him down, bury him - whatever it takes!
DDM00001265	...and that's more like it, got a beat you can swing to. And they won't set off your collar any more - just hit that guy where it hurts.
DDM00001266	I can handle a 200 year old washed-out lounge singer, trust me.
DDM00001267	I guess I'll try the key and see.
DDM00001268	We'll talk about this more when we're face-to-face.
DDM00001269	Really? You're a terrible liar. See you soon, Dean.
DDM00001270	Of all the... where the hell are those stupid Holograms already? Even if you get back here, you won't live long, trust me.
DDM00001271	...that plan sounds pretty clear to me. Got it.
DDM00001272	So as long as I make sure I don't run for the exit...
DDM00001273	What... what now? Try and come back here?
DDM00001274	No, you belong out in the audience... I mean, not like... uh... you could get backstage. That key you snagged, it won't work.
DDM00001275	...head backstage, destroy every speaker, grab every key, then shut down security...
DDM00001276	I'm that predictable, am I? You're probably right.
DDM00001277	I guess I should have figured you'd have an escape plan. Clever.
DDM00001278	I'm not a betting man, I've come too far to leave it to chance.
DDM00001279	Really? What makes you think you can slip out?
DDM00001280	Way I figure it, you'll try and run for the exit, and only I know where the key is - and where the safest place in the whole theater is: backstage.
DDM00001281	You, you're trapped down there, and you couldn't shut off the speakers, unlock the doors, or cancel security if you tried.
DDM00001282	What about the collars, huh? Kill me, and...
DDM00001283	[SUCCEEDED] No... no... the collars... I know what happened now. Sure, mine activated... but it feels different, the electronic tapdance inside.
DDM00001284	I can kill you and still make it out while security is busy frying you to a crisp. Hands are clean, then smooth sailing to the Sierra Madre.
DDM00001285	And the collars? You sound awfully eager to kill someone whose life is tied to yours.
DDM00001286	[FAILED] No... I know how the collars behave now, in here anyway. At least the Sierra Madre gave me that.
DDM00001287	I should be thankful, in a second, it'll give me another gift - with any luck, security'll leave enough of your ashes for an urn on my mantle.
DDM00001288	Fine with me. Come on, let's settle this.
DDM00001289	Oh, I'm not going to fight you - I'm going to let security show you out. Didn't see anyone come in? Well... they'll be here soon.
DDM00001290	Security? What security?
DDM00001291	Didn't see anyone come in? Well... they'll be here soon.
DDM00001292	And go on, run for the exit door, this'll be fun to watch.
DDM00001293	Come on, Dean, turning me to ash? Hardly the way to end a beautiful partnership.
DDM00001294	It's a shame... I regret it. Still, you dames are all the same - things get a little hot, you get cold feet. That's why I'm still alive. You? Well...
DDM00001295	I'm not sure.
DDM00001296	That's... hmm. Never mind, doesn't change anything. The Sierra Madre's still waiting for us to crack it open.
DDM00001297	Why did you need her?
DDM00001298	Because she could get closer to Sinclair than I ever could. He built this place for her... well, after the two "chanced" to meet.
DDM00001299	I think she was sick, yes. Found a medical report in her Suite.
DDM00001300	What are you talking about? Medical report? Vera wasn't...
DDM00001301	...the Med-X and Superstims. And here I thought she was trying to numb herself to the lights.
DDM00001302	Sinclair must have known, though. He was dense, not in that way. But... that doesn't make any sense. If she was sick, dying...
DDM00001303	...then why build this place? Why start a damn casino and have her be the lock?
DDM00001304	I'm positive you have it. Now, I'll just kill you and take it.
DDM00001305	What? Hey, hey... now... w-wait... I... ah, forget it. Time for the hard way.
DDM00001306	Give me the key, Dean, and you walk.
DDM00001307	No, based on your response, I'm sure of it.
DDM00001308	All right, all right... look, I'll hand it over, I promise. No need to get all upset. We can both come out ahead in this.
DDM00001309	I bet I can figure out how to unlock the exit without you.
DDM00001310	[SUCCEEDED] Lucky guess... you sure about that? Because if you make a mistake... well, Sierra Madre's got us both.
DDM00001311	You're not a betting man, which means I'm betting you have the key to the exit on you.
DDM00001312	[FAILED] Yeah, you're a gambler. Me, I don't take chances. Trust me, only one of us has a sure out.
DDM00001313	That's all I wanted to know. Ready to die?
DDM00001314	Always asking questions when you should be shooting. You're a piece of work, I'll give you that.
DDM00001315	I found this Holotape in your safe.
DDM00001316	You don't just stop robbing casinos, do you? What's that tape... oh, the one with Sinclair's woman, Vera.
DDM00001317	What about it? You want me to give you a standing ovation?
DDM00001318	Has the Cloud decayed your brain? Forget the Sierra Madre!
DDM00001319	I'm not interested in killing you.
DDM00001320	Are you really that stupid?
DDM00001321	I waited an entire lifetime! Sitting in that Villa, watching it all fall apart - Sinclair's Sierra Madre towering over everything? Untouched?!
DDM00001322	Then you show up, thinking you can just take it all from me, you and the old man running the show? I planned all this, I made it all happen, not you!
DDM00001323	Sure, yeah, I have the key on me. I made other keys, too, to unlock the casino and ruin Sinclair, finally. After all these years...
DDM00001324	No... now... now I think ruining you and all your plans would be enough for me. Kill me, I still win, you're never getting in the vault.
DDM00001325	Forget it, I'll just kill you and take it.
DDM00001326	Quit stalling, hand it over.
DDM00001327	Are you going to give me the key or not?
DDM00001328	Look... I give you this key, and there's nothing to keep you from just killing me and running. And as I see it...
DDM00001329	...I just gave up my ace in the hole. So... the only chance I've got left is making sure you don't leave.
DDM00001330	And there's no way in hell I'm letting you get to the Sierra Madre vault instead of me. Not after all this time.
DDM00001331	You must know me enough by now to know I'm not going to put you in danger.
DDM00001332	Oh, right, after all the "we'll both blow up if you don't do as I say" talk we first had. Not put me in danger? Right.
DDM00001333	Yeah... yeah, you're right. You didn't have to switch on those Holograms, and you did.
DDM00001334	Even when you first showed up in the Villa, you didn't threaten me, were just willing to cooperate to get through this. Hnh.
DDM00001335	I think you can count on the Holograms, okay?
DDM00001336	[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. You got a point.
DDM00001337	Vera's stayed powered up since the bombs fell... those Holograms will, too.
DDM00001338	[FAILED] Really? You're not the one standing up here waiting for the Ghost People to show, all right?
DDM00001339	Just trust me, all right?
DDM00001340	[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. You got a point.
DDM00001341	Don't trust me? Then trust our collars. I die, you die. Got it?
DDM00001342	[FAILED] Trust you? Right. You're not the one who has to sit up here and wait for the Ghost People to show.
DDM00001343	Look, what do you want to do this?
DDM00001344	[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. You got a point.
DDM00001345	I'm not about to trade your life for mine, got it? Remember the collars.
DDM00001346	[FAILED] What do I want? I want a little more insurance than some Old World Villa construction to guard me, all right?
DDM00001347	Dean... a man with cold feet isn't someone I'd share a bed with.
DDM00001348	Wait, hold on. I didn't say I was scared. Heh, heh. Cold feet? Don't be ridiculous. I've played to worse crowds than this, I can hold the fort here.
DDM00001349	If you don't do this, I'll go shut off the Holograms now.
DDM00001350	What? You wouldn't. I mean... no, wait, you would. You don't bluff, ever since you first showed up in the Villa and we chatted.
DDM00001351	No... you wouldn't. You're not the type. Even when you first showed up in the Villa, you didn't threaten me.
DDM00001352	You just let me talk, not even letting on that our collars were linked, when all you had to do was tell me that to get me to come along.
DDM00001353	So... no, I don't think you'll shut them off. You don't threaten people, not your way.
DDM00001354	Do what I say, or I'll break both your legs and leave you here.
DDM00001355	If I break your legs, you can't leave - only scream. Here, in the middle of town.
DDM00001356	No, it only means I wouldn't come back for you. Ever.
DDM00001357	You wouldn't... no, yeah, you would. I would. If I thought you screaming wouldn't attract more of the locals.
DDM00001358	All right, I'll stay here. For now. But you leave me high and dry, make a run for the Sierra Madre? You'll pay for it, I promise you.
DDM00001359	All I need is your hands to hold the wires.
DDM00001360	I could break both your legs, leave you here on the roof.
DDM00001361	You wouldn't. You need me to strike up the sparking chords there. Breaking my legs isn't any way to get me to dance.
DDM00001362	Both of us dying wasn't my plan.
DDM00001363	I don't need to kill you, you know.
DDM00001364	What? What are you talking about?
DDM00001365	Okay, let me see if I can reactivate the Holograms.
DDM00001366	If I remember correctly, there should be two Holograms you can switch on in the area... just don't remember how.
DDM00001367	Do that, and I'll consider waiting on the rooftop. Maybe.
DDM00001368	I switched on two Holograms to cover the courtyard, those should protect you.
DDM00001369	You powered the Holograms up? Well... yeah, that's pretty good protection. Sure worked at the fountain, Vera kept the Ghost People away.
DDM00001370	But, uh... how do I know the power won't suddenly go out? And... I don't know, this still sounds risky to me. For me.
DDM00001371	I could just throw you off the roof. What about that?
DDM00001372	You're full of it - you kill me, we both die. You wouldn't dare.
DDM00001373	So you leaving me here? No dice, not going to happen, and nothing you can say will change my mind.
DDM00001374	What if I can guarantee they won't come into the courtyard below?
DDM00001375	[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. If the Hologram systems still work, that'd do the trick.
DDM00001376	Okay... all right, you call up some of those Old World stiffs, that'd be an audience I wouldn't mind having below.
DDM00001377	The Villa has Holograms everywhere. If I switch on some to cover the area...
DDM00001378	[FAILED] Yeah, and how can you guarantee that? I'm not waiting here alone, trust me.
DDM00001379	I mean, if I had a few of those Holograms... or a few hundred... surrounding me, maybe. I'd settle for two, enough to cover a quick exit.
DDM00001380	All right. What's it going to take?
DDM00001381	Take? It's not going to take anything because you couldn't offer me anything to stay here.
DDM00001382	The Ghost People'll come out of the woodwork when the Gala Event starts blaring, and when they see me trapped up here? It's curtains for Dean.
DDM00001383	If I clear out all the Ghost People in the area, will you change your mind?
DDM00001384	No, you want to know why? Because there's more beneath the streets, in the buildings, and oh - everywhere else.
DDM00001385	They hear anything out of the ordinary, especially "music" screaming through the speakers when I close the connection? They'll be here, fast.
DDM00001386	Look, I need you to stay here and do it.
DDM00001387	In the middle of town here? Alone? On a rooftop, with a big lightshow in the air?
DDM00001388	Tell you what - why don't you just give me one of those Space Age Cosmic Knives so I can slit my wrists, be less painful checking out that way.
DDM00001389	If re-connecting the speakers is part of the Gala Event, yes.
DDM00001390	Look... I strike up the speaker system, there's going to be ghosts all over this place. Any change in the sounds around here...
DDM00001391	...the Ghost People are not big on talking, they are big on listening. Hunting. Killing. More vicious than music critics, trust me.
DDM00001392	I could just jab both wires into you, close the circuit that way.
DDM00001393	Really? You don't strike me as the type, especially after our little "how can I cooperate" chat at my home.
DDM00001394	Real funny. Although you know, after your "collar talk" in the Residential area, I believe you.
DDM00001395	That's the plan. Are you going to be able to do it safely?
DDM00001396	Well... "safely?" Around here, that word doesn't come cheap.
DDM00001397	Safely? What, after your sweet-and-ruthless talk when we first met, now you care about my safety? Right.
DDM00001398	There's a Hologram guarding the courtyard below, you're covered.
DDM00001399	Unless he's got a friend, no dice. Nobody relies on a single escape route unless they want to get caught.
DDM00001400	Unless he's got a friend, no dice. Nobody relies on a single escape route unless they want to get caught.
DDM00001401	Let me hunt around, maybe there's something I can do to protect the area.
DDM00001402	You can look all you want... I still feel safer with a pair of Hologram escorts to make it through the area.
DDM00001403	How do you make it?
DDM00001404	Scrape some Cloud Residue off the walls, mash it in a Tin Can with some Junk Food from the machines, then hold your nose and down it.
DDM00001405	There's Electric Hot Plates around if you can't find a campfire to mix it at. Also, there's other recipes you can do with the Cloud Residue...
DDM00001406	...although it might take a hardier survivalist than me to brew them. I stick to martinis.
DDM00001407	Scrounge supplies? Like what?
DDM00001408	I still need to eat. At least I think I do. The Villa provides... even if it's not as glamorous as the Cantina Madrid.
DDM00001409	Once I... well, realized what you could scrounge up around here, I had a lot of time to experiment. Not the best chef, but...
DDM00001410	...well, here's the mix, if you can stomach it. I call it a "Sierra Madre Martini."
DDM00001411	I found one of your stashes. Why did you leave them around the Villa?
DDM00001412	Why? Survival. I still needed to leave the Residential Area to scrounge up supplies, and I don't like taking chances.
DDM00001413	The Villa's dangerous. So I left weapons and stims in case I got in a tight spot. Then, of course, you show up, putting your mitts on everything.
DDM00001414	I suppose this qualifies as an emergency, so I'm not complaining. Much.
DDM00001415	You can use these somehow? To make... make Sierra Madre Chips?
DDM00001416	Maybe if I find what you're talking about, you can let me know.
DDM00001417	Can you teach me how to do it?
DDM00001418	[She nods. She then makes a series of hand motions to represent weight and amounts - enough so you think you could do it on your own.]
DDM00001419	You need a battery... a Fission Battery... and Scrap Metal? And you can counterfeit the chips?
DDM00001420	[She nods, impressed. Then she points at you, then her and makes a circle.]
DDM00001421	Maybe if I find whatever objects you're trying to describe, this might make more sense.
DDM00001422	I have no idea what you're talking about.
DDM00001423	[SUCCEEDED] [She smiles, nods.]
DDM00001424	[She points at your Pip-Boy, makes a motion of opening it up and removing something from it.]
DDM00001425	[She then raises her hand and makes the motion of smashing it and holding up the remains.]
DDM00001426	You can make more of those at a Workbench. With the right materials.
DDM00001427	[FAILED] [She frowns, then thinks for a moment. She then points at your pack, and taps the back of her wrist.]
DDM00001428	Yeah, there's more. All over.
DDM00001429	I don't understand.
DDM00001430	[She frowns, looks frustrated for a moment, thinking.]
DDM00001431	[She stands still for a second, then stops, and slowly makes the motion of bending down and scooping something up.]
DDM00001432	[Then she holds the imaginary object in her hand, as if heavy, and puts it in front of her, as if on a table.]
DDM00001433	[She then hefts what looks like a small box, and pours it on top of the object, looks at it, then reaches down and holds up a small "O."]
DDM00001434	[Christine points at your pack, then points at the Fission Battery and the Scrap Metal.]
DDM00001435	You... can make more?
DDM00001436	[SUCCEEDED] [She smiles, nods.]
DDM00001437	You can... scrounge more somehow.
DDM00001438	[FAILED] [She frowns, looks frustrated for a moment, thinking.]
DDM00001439	We really don't have time for magic tricks right now.
DDM00001440	[She frowns, shakes her head.]
DDM00001441	You want... a small circle?
DDM00001442	[She frowns, shakes her head.]
DDM00001443	Here's a Sierra Madre Chip. I'll need that back.
DDM00001444	[She examines the chip for a second, raises it to her eye, then turns it to the side, gauging its diameter and width.]
DDM00001445	[She runs her finger over the surface slowly, checking the engraving. She then tosses the chip back to you.]
DDM00001446	[She then pretends to look around, sees something on the floor, then pretends to bend down and pick it up. She then looks at you and nods.]
DDM00001447	I don't have any Sierra Madre Chips on me.
DDM00001448	[She nods, then waits.]
DDM00001449	Do you know what those machines around the Villa are?
DDM00001450	[Christine shakes her head, then pauses, and makes a small circle with her thumb and forefinger.]
DDM00001451	[She points at you, and makes the motion of putting something in her palm.]
DDM00001452	Can you show me where?
DDM00001453	Dog can... see where back of collar is? Follow down, to lower back - hit neck, middle back, right on spine, crack. Then they not get back up.
DDM00001454	Dog hits them, then Dog eats them... easier to make quiet twice that way.
DDM00001455	How do you do it?
DDM00001456	Dog knows where to hit them, make them stay down... base of neck, lower back, hit it hard enough, life snaps out of them.
DDM00001457	That all seems lethal. Sort of.
DDM00001458	[SUCCEEDED] Dism... disin... chop legs off while stand up, eat when fall down. If not that, make them electric ash.
DDM00001459	So... dismemberment and disintegrations take them down.
DDM00001460	[FAILED] All make them stay down. Most of time.
DDM00001461	Do you need to eat them to make them stay down?
DDM00001462	No... if you rip their arms off... or legs, mask people stay down. Easier to rip off legs and arms when they fall on ground, just keep hitting them.
DDM00001463	If can't make them fall down and rip off legs, make them ash. Saw one caught in electric sparks so much, he turn into burnt pile. Not get back up.
DDM00001464	Why do you eat the Ghost People?
DDM00001465	Dog doesn't like to eat them always, sometimes so many.
DDM00001466	Doesn't that make the voice mad?
DDM00001467	Voice doesn't get mad when Dog feeds on the people here. Voice not like Ghost People, worried there are too many to eat, too many knives.
DDM00001468	Started eating them because wouldn't go quiet when Dog smashed them with bear jaw. Only want one.
DDM00001469	Got Dog angry, others kept cutting him and slicing him with knives when he tried to make one go quiet with teeth.
DDM00001470	So Dog started crushing them, then when they stop twitching, then eats them. Then they not get back up with hssss-chkk noise, Dog not like that.
DDM00001471	Dog can tell when they not yet dead... twitch a bit, make low noise, then noise when they get back up, listen.
DDM00001472	I watched you devour one of the Ghost People.
DDM00001473	Dog doesn't like to eat them always, sometimes so many. Keep stabbing Dog, cutting him.
DDM00001474	Do you know how the Ghost People taste?
DDM00001475	Taste like plastic and copper. Gas inside, in pockets, hssss when teeth sinks into them.
DDM00001476	<Lie> I'll go hunt for food, you just stay here, and wait.
DDM00001477	All right... for a moment there, I thought... hnh. I'll wait here then, come back when you've found meat from two of the bodies.
DDM00001478	You need to trust me if we're going to get through this.
DDM00001479	No, you'll throw me in the cage when you need to, just like at the Police Station. Trust you? No... you've made trust... difficult.
DDM00001480	I'm not staying here and doing what you "order" me to do. Not again... and the sequence here? Just see if Dog can figure it out on his own.
DDM00001481	What kind of food should I bring back?
DDM00001482	Dog has torn apart a number of the inhabitants of this town... while he doesn't prefer them to... other flesh... it'll do for the time being.
DDM00001483	Find some of the inhabitants... it'll require some hunting on your part. Kill them, take some of the remains inside them, bring it back here.
DDM00001484	They're not easy to kill. But... I have faith in you, and the beast must be fed if you want him to stay in this cage.
DDM00001485	I need you to trust me. I let you out of the cage in the Police Station.
DDM00001486	You're right... but trust? Trust is such a... harsh word. I prefer... mutual need. It's more honest.
DDM00001487	No, I can help you. These wiring diagrams... I know how to operate the switches in sequence to make fire appear in the sky.
DDM00001488	I... we just need to make sure that Dog doesn't surface before that happens. To do that... he'll need to be fed. That makes him stay in the Cage.
DDM00001489	Worried about being attacked if left here? The gate looks strong enough.
DDM00001490	This Villa was built to decay, but parts... parts were well-defended, indeed. There was a method in the layout, you can... see it.
DDM00001491	The terminal outside... one of those means this place was designed... properly. No, if locked, it could hold others out... and even Dog inside.
DDM00001492	Do you know how to operate the switches?
DDM00001493	I do. And after you threw me in the cage at the Police Station, I have no intention of telling you.
DDM00001494	I do... the diagram there tells me what I need to know.
DDM00001495	If you won't do it, then Dog will, like he did at the police station.
DDM00001496	No... this time is different. The key is different.
DDM00001497	I bet I can get Dog to stay here, if you won't.
DDM00001498	Really... an amusing thought.
DDM00001499	If you needed his teeth to devour those metal switches, chew up the diagram, then let him out.
DDM00001500	There's a sequence, precise and clear as a knife, that must be followed. And it requires more than instinct to operate.
DDM00001501	No, you need me, here - out of the cage.
DDM00001502	I need you to stay and operate the switches for the Gala Event.
DDM00001503	You can lead me to water... no, being trapped in this courtyard while lights are flashing and sirens are screaming...
DDM00001504	I can survive one or two of the inhabitants... more than that, even Dog would have to work to keep full without being carved to pieces.
DDM00001505	And the gate here... if it somehow got locked, it'd be the holding cell at the Police Station again, except with no way out.
DDM00001506	He wasn't trying to torture you, he needed to alter your voice to use an audio-lock.
DDM00001507	An audio-lock to where? To the Sierra Madre vault. It's voice-activated. And he wanted in.
DDM00001508	That makes sense. So... those bodies in the Clinic... all right. Dean always felt like the odd one out, and he kept... studying me.
DDM00001509	He was trying to figure out if I recognized him... and see if my throat healed. I'll deal with you first, then I'll deal with him.
DDM00001510	I didn't put you in that Auto-Doc. Dean did.
DDM00001511	Dean? He put me in there? No, I don't believe it. He didn't have any reason to torture me. You, on the other hand...
DDM00001512	Even with the differences in the Villa, I don't want to fight.
DDM00001513	[SUCCEEDED] No, I believe you. All along, you were watching out for yourself. I understand.
DDM00001514	But I wonder what you would have done if there hadn't been these collars. Would you have gotten me out of the Clinic at all?
DDM00001515	So as long as we're "in this together," and it's a choice between you and me? I know what you're going to choose.
DDM00001516	I'm not gonna wait for that to happen - again. I'm tired of being controlled.
DDM00001517	We're inside the casino. We don't need to fight anymore, it's useless.
DDM00001518	[FAILED] I believe you. And that's not the point. That collar... I believe you got caught by Elijah, too. I don't think it changes who you are.
DDM00001519	How you behaved in the Villa... all that was you. And as bad as these collars are, maybe it kept you from being worse.
DDM00001520	And that's the worst part about all this. That it takes something like that to keep you from hurting someone else.
DDM00001521	You know I didn't put you in the Auto-Doc, right?
DDM00001522	You, Elijah... it doesn't matter. Both of you have run out of places to hide.
DDM00001523	There'll be a second or two of lag while you switch it. That's long enough for me to kill you.
DDM00001524	We'll see. I don't think you're gonna have the time.
DDM00001525	Done talking? I want to put your little theory to the test.
DDM00001526	What are you talking about?
DDM00001527	You'll find out.
DDM00001528	Try and run, it won't matter, the signal will find you. Get too close to me, then the signal'll lock on. You can't get away.
DDM00001529	But... your collar's still on. So you're not free.
DDM00001530	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, it helps... as long as I need to control your movements.
DDM00001531	You can modify the detonator signal. I don't see how that helps you.
DDM00001532	[FAILED] Free? I have more freedom of movement than you do, and that's all I need.
DDM00001533	Is that like a science thing?
DDM00001534	[SUCCEEDED] I did. And it means I can control your movements.
DDM00001535	You found a way to modify the collar's radio frequency.
DDM00001536	[FAILED] You'll find out.
DDM00001537	If killing you will shut you up, let's do this.
DDM00001538	You've had your voice back for only a little while, and I'm already sick of listening to you.
DDM00001539	Silence suits me fine. When your master shows, I'll deal with him, too.
DDM00001540	What are you planning to do?
DDM00001541	When we first met, I thought I recognized the collar technology. Just needed some time to experiment with it.
DDM00001542	I noticed the signal lag as soon as you arrived on the floor. Collar detonator signal's down to a dull thud, more like a heartbeat than a screech.
DDM00001543	You think you can kill me, then make a run for the exit before my dead man's signal catches you and blows that collar. Not gonna be that easy.
DDM00001544	The Suites here gave me enough tools and enough time that our frequencies... I can push and pull that collar of yours however I want.
DDM00001545	Thought you'd leave me in that elevator? I haven't forgotten what you did in the Switching Station, not for a second.
DDM00001546	Trapped down in that room in the dark, listening to that sound, like saw blades. I could barely breathe... couldn't even scream!
DDM00001547	Was like being operated on in that Auto-Doc in the Clinic... all over again.
DDM00001548	Come to throw me in the Auto-Doc? Toss me back in the Clinic where you found me?
DDM00001549	Did you know the Stimpak reservoirs ran out within an hour of being in there? I was in there for two weeks, and it kept... repeating the procedure.
DDM00001550	No Med-X, no stims, just... that sound, feeling the scalpels... cut. Now... we're going to see how you like it when someone else is in control.
DDM00001551	I can switch the proximity of the detonation frequency. Try and run? I'll have the signal seek you out, blow up your collar from a distance.
DDM00001552	Come in close, maybe get the upper hand? I'll set off the proximity detonator, and your collar'll blow.
DDM00001553	[She points at the casino, makes a movement with her hands as if talking, and then repeats the squinting gesture.]
DDM00001554	[Christine waits, studying you.]
DDM00001555	We're not heading to the police station, are we? Ghost People hunt there.
DDM00001556	Hnnh. City smells bad in some places, so bad it makes people fall down.
DDM00001557	Careful, the Villa's filled with pockets from the Cloud. Lethal.
DDM00001558	[Christine sniffs the air, then touches her neck and frowns. She gestures at the air and taps her wrist.]
DDM00001559	[Christine's eyes narrow. She raises an index finger, as if listening, then points ahead grimly and pulls back an imaginary trigger.]
DDM00001560	[Christine looks at the machine and frowns. She points at the narrow slot on the side and raises an eyebrow.]
DDM00001561	[Christine studies the area, then the Police Station. She pretends to unload a weapon and holds up the imaginary cartridge, waving it.]
DDM00001562	Sinclair's little surgery carts. Kept them around for his lady friend.
DDM00001563	The police station... Ghost People love this place, no idea why. Might be the Holograms nearby.
DDM00001564	Those machines... Sinclair's little gifts, lasted longer than he did. If you need food, stims... put in a chip, hold out your hand.
DDM00001565	Pretty circle on machine, all glowing.
DDM00001566	Those machines feed on Sierra Madre Chips. There's codes that unlock other things, too.
DDM00001567	"Begin again - but know when to let go."
DDM00001568	I dealt with the other two in our team, now I need you to open something.
DDM00001569	What? Open something... my voice. That's why it's hers... someone wanted to use me as a key.
DDM00001570	All right, I can do that... hope you're ready.
DDM00001571	What would you use them for?
DDM00001572	I can't argue that.
DDM00001573	Sources of food, supplies... medical assistance, ammo... make more collars, even print currency. Make a nation.
DDM00001574	The Cloud allows me to wipe the slate clean. Collars ensure cooperation. Holograms - defense. The Vending Machines provide... everything else.
DDM00001575	The Sierra Madre can kill nations and build them, using its technology with the right applications.
DDM00001576	If you secure that, that's all you want?
DDM00001577	No, there is one last thing I want from the Sierra Madre. Its bounty. The machines that fill its streets, its corridors.
DDM00001578	They provide, provide almost anything. Perhaps in the Pre-War era, they were commonplace, things to dismiss.
DDM00001579	Now, they are far more valuable. You know it. They helped keep you alive.
DDM00001580	Working as murderous deathtraps, sure.
DDM00001581	Properly? Are you kidding me?
DDM00001582	The Holograms here kill trespassers. That's what I want. Dump one of those emitters in the middle of any battle, there's no defense.
DDM00001583	It's like holding light in your hands. Can't fight it... only watch it burn. Just one is a portable army. Arm it - anyone stands against you, dies.
DDM00001584	I don't understand how an Old World casino helps you do any of that.
DDM00001585	The Cloud is unique in my travels. Its proximity to the Sierra Madre isn't a coincidence.
DDM00001586	Right now it protects this casino, preserves it. It can be used to preserve other Old World relics - and cleanse them, at the same time.
DDM00001587	And as much as I've researched hologram technology, the Big Empty facility was clear - only the Sierra Madre got Holograms working... properly.
DDM00001588	What do you want from the Sierra Madre?
DDM00001589	What do I want. Weapons. Security. A citadel of my own.
DDM00001590	The Madre's all these things. It's a fortress and a weapon. A chance... to... "begin again."
DDM00001591	Once I unlock its archives, I can carve the Mojave into any shape I choose.
DDM00001592	I've never heard of the place you're talking about.
DDM00001593	Big Empty's a treasure box, a scientific graveyard of Old World misery. Like the Sierra Madre... there's treasures there, sleeping. Some, awake.
DDM00001594	The Holorifle, the Saturnite alloy... the hologram technology, hibernation chambers, Securitrons, the collars...
DDM00001595	...even the suits attached to those things stalking the Villa... that's only the surface of what's there. Right now, the Sierra Madre is what I want.
DDM00001596	If they're Pre-War tech, where did you get them?
DDM00001597	A place far from here, called the Big Empty. Almost didn't make it out.
DDM00001598	Were two others there... a woman. And a man, a courier. The woman was familiar... the other... I don't know what happened to him.
DDM00001599	Where did you get the collars?
DDM00001600	The collars. They're Pre-War tech, I suspect this great land had... compliance issues before the war.
DDM00001601	It's one of a series of models. The one on your neck? Special, easier to make adjustments. Unreliable in other ways, notably radio interference.
DDM00001602	This is the past you're walking through. Few have ever seen it. No one else ever will.
DDM00001603	I worked hard to get here, it'll give me what I need before I leave. And it'll always welcome me back.
DDM00001604	Now... look for a way to wake this ghost up, remind it it's got guests.
DDM00001605	You inside. Can you hear me? Power's fluctuating... emergency power. Oh! You are in.
DDM00001606	Good... thought that might be the end of you. Unfortunately, your... "friends" also found their way here. Knocked unconscious... just like you.
DDM00001607	Wondering what happened? You were hit by casino security. Detects anything foreign - radioactive, it subdues the "visitor," moves them if needed.
DDM00001608	Hnh... getting interference from old recordings... the guests who were trapped here... eh, shut that noise off...
DDM00001609	Looks like the casino moved your "friends" around once inside... might be useful. Or not. Wonder if they came to help or kill you. Still...
DDM00001610	My signal should work through the speakers, now that you're inside. Heh, heh! Welcome to the Sierra Madre, in all its glory.
DDM00001611	This is what the Old World stood for, even with bombs about to rain down on them. Now look at it.
DDM00001612	Beautiful... now its guests are all dead. Better this way. Quiet. How the Mojave should be.
DDM00001613	Now - with the casino sleeping, it's got places closed off - won't let you go yet. We'll get there, trust me, just need to wake it up.
DDM00001614	Casino's woken up, paying attention to us. Good.
DDM00001615	Wondering what happened to your team...? Looks like they got moved to other floors. Interesting, maybe that's why... hmmm, yes... yes.
DDM00001616	Perhaps the casino recognized specific guests... or guests with a voice or look close enough for them to be... assigned to that floor. We'll see.
DDM00001617	Had hoped with the power restored, the systems would fully awaken... especially the sound archives.
DDM00001618	But no... your teammates' collars on each floor are interfering with the systems.
DDM00001619	It's the white noise filters embedded in their construction... they're blocking the casino speakers, the music.
DDM00001620	You'll need to recalibrate... or destroy... each collar. To do that, you need to get close, re-set the signal - or blow their heads off.
DDM00001621	I'll leave the choice up to you - my preference? End them now. They're of no use.
DDM00001622	After all, it's safe to kill them now, provided you make it quick.
DDM00001623	You see, the collars don't work inside the Sierra Madre... well, between floors. Else, I'd set off the collars, be done with it.
DDM00001624	So find them, deal with them, as long as you're fast and can get off the floor after killing them.
DDM00001625	The floors... whatever they lined this place with, interferes with the collar frequency... so if you kill them, you should have some time to run.
DDM00001626	Uh... just not sure how long, may not be consistent. More... less... whatever, it doesn't matter.
DDM00001627	What we need is in the basement, we need to go to the top first and ride our fortunes down. After we deal with your team on the other floors.
DDM00001628	You woke it up... good. Emitter frequencies... lighting up everywhere...
DDM00001629	Damn recordings... dead echoes in the frequencies...
DDM00001630	Casino's security is shutting down... opening up its vendor and gambling programs in the back casino... Heh! Still might be something for sale.
DDM00001631	Maybe something can help you now - security's shut down. After you're done looking around, head to the lobby, and we'll deal with your... friends.
DDM00001632	[Christine looks around, then nods toward a terminal on the far side of the room.]
DDM00001633	See? That... wasn't so bad, was it?
DDM00001634	[Christine points to an electrical box on the wall, and twists her hand.]
DDM00001635	Guess we're going the long way around.
DDM00001636	[Christine nods at the toxic cloud below, then makes a walking motion with her fingers and slowly shakes her head.]
DDM00001637	Looks like we'll have to go through this pea soup. I can get you across.
DDM00001638	I found the phrase for elevator's audio lock.
DDM00001639	You did? Looks like even the Old World can't keep you out when you've got a mind to get in.
DDM00001640	You'll have to wait just a little longer.
DDM00001641	Fine. I hear my collar beeping though, I've got the route to the exit all mapped out.
DDM00001642	[Christine shakes her head as you approach the edge of the catwalk. She turns away from the catwalk and begins looking around.]
DDM00001643	Heh... now, come on, you open up. Open up, damn you.
DDM00001644	Open the vault... I can make it worth your while, think about what you're throwing away. I have other weapons, other technology I can share with you.
DDM00001645	And the Big Empty... I know the way there. I know some of its secrets... if...
DDM00001646	The collars... the collars were a mistake, I see that now. Why would I kill you? After all you've done... after all we've done together.
DDM00001647	Are you listening to me?!
DDM00001648	Everything down here... I swear... so much you could use, you could rule the wastes with what's down here...
DDM00001649	...make your own army, re-shape the world, and if others disagree... put collars on them, I can show you how.
DDM00001650	Don't you leave me here. You can't do this to me. 
DDM00001651	Eh? Getting dark in here. Machine... machine's losing power, no. I still have Pip-Boy light... maybe... maybe... no, no, that doesn't work.
DDM00001652	Where... where is the door. Can't find the door.
DDM00001653	Calm, been in worse situations... find a way out... somehow, then find that Courier...
DDM00001654	Maybe Veronica... no... no, she thinks I'm dead.
DDM00001655	Must be someone... maybe that other courier, one with the flag on his back... maybe... no... no, said he'd never come to the Sierra Madre...
DDM00001656	No way out. Can't... can't end like this.
DDM00001657	You. I know you can hear me. When you die, Courier... I'll be waiting. Your grave's going look just like this vault.
DDM00001658	When you die... I'll be waiting here... at the Sierra Madre. Waiting.
DDM00001659	When you die, I'll be waiting...
DDM00001660	What, you need surgery done? Let's get out of here... those speakers on the wall are making my nerves do a dance.
DDM00001661	Watch for Hologram security, not as nice as the lady at the fountain, trust me.
DDM00001662	What are we doing here? We're not going to find a doctor on call at this hour, trust me.
DDM00001663	Place is haunted, got ghosts walking in it.
DDM00001664	I don't believe you.
DDM00001665	You think I wanted to send you here without weapons, healing? No, the Sierra Madre lays you bare, strips and stores all your worldly possessions...
DDM00001666	...it's automated to move things as the builder saw fit, Sinclair - even the guests. It's what divided your team, me, assigned us to "our floors."
DDM00001667	No contraband, nothing foreign in his paradise - even common Pre-War vending machines were banned from the Villa.
DDM00001668	So the casino stripped me of my gear?
DDM00001669	The Villa did, as an extension of the casino, yes - and then sent it back to the owner's residence. Here, "begin again" is more than a slogan.
DDM00001670	Do you know how to get out of here?
DDM00001671	Of course. I walked all this way. If you're worried... I'll give you a map back - or show you the way out when this is all over.
DDM00001672	What happened to my gear?
DDM00001673	It lies in the bunker - or whatever mantrap caught you. It's the Sierra Madre, its security systems strip guests to their garments.
DDM00001674	It has... prejudices against outside material, "contraband." Almost anything with a radiation signature.
DDM00001675	The New Vegas casinos do the same thing, manually. Although preventing bloodshed, not radiation poisoning, is their main concern.
DDM00001676	If Dog put a collar on me, why didn't he say so?
DDM00001677	"Dog?" Hnh. Appropriate. It's what I called him. You've met him. You know why he forgot - his brain was ruined by FEV, his memory, wreckage.
DDM00001678	He may know the way back, somewhere, deep down. I doubt it. He tracks by smell and instinct. Still, he could be trained.
DDM00001679	So someone else with a collar placed one on me? Who?
DDM00001680	The mutant. Heh! He swallowed one of the collars... after that, he was mine. The collar wasn't even necessary.
DDM00001681	All his kind, they exist to be given orders. They're soldiers - simple, stupid. I ask him to fetch, he did... even without the threat of death.
DDM00001682	Even when I stopped speaking to him, he continued to leave the Villa, gather victims from the mantraps, out of habit.
DDM00001683	He must have found you in one of them. If so, he's probably forgotten - he only remembers my voice.
DDM00001684	He put the collar on you, dragged you here, because he doesn't know any better. It's in his nature, greedy and child-like.
DDM00001685	How did you get me here?
DDM00001686	Everyone asks that. Should be asking how they plan on leaving.
DDM00001687	It only takes putting a collar on one to begin the chain. One with a collar may chain another. And that one, another. Had traps all over the wastes.
DDM00001688	The chain ends with the super mutant. Although with him... the collar wasn't even necessary. He only needed... guidance.
DDM00001689	Now that I'm here, are you coming down?
DDM00001690	I'm sick of talking to some image on a screen. If you're going to come down, do it.
DDM00001691	No. I am not going to take the chance while I'm so close... not this close, no. Not again... I can wait... afford to be careful.
DDM00001692	You... you're locked down there. This is the only entrance, and I have free rein of the Sierra Madre. I have time... more than you.
DDM00001693	Besides, there might be more traps. I'll send more scouts in... yes, others. You're... resourceful, don't want to leave anything more to chance.
DDM00001694	What happened?
DDM00001695	So you answered madness with madness?
DDM00001696	When your life is tied to another's, sacrifice and cooperation - they can be conditioned, learned, and you can focus on the matter at hand.
DDM00001697	Greed can be beaten. Contained. Controlled. You know it better than anyone... or I hope you do. It doesn't matter.
DDM00001698	What are you talking about?
DDM00001699	Every time, even with collars clutched at their necks... they would betray each other, kill each other, to get inside the Sierra Madre.
DDM00001700	It... it was insanity. They could've had it all, it was so close. And... and they kept turning on each other, again and again.
DDM00001701	Cracking the Sierra Madre was difficult... but cracking greed, that was more difficult. So the dead man's switches went in.
DDM00001702	You're nothing more than a killer that aspires to mass murder.
DDM00001703	You think I'm a murderer. If I was, I'd have set off your collar long ago... the collar ensures compliance, encourages... cooperation.
DDM00001704	Think about it. Would you truly have gotten into the casino without those collars? No, human nature is against us, always.
DDM00001705	Did you know... did you know that I had to keep adjusting the collars, keep changing the rules to make this moment possible?
DDM00001706	How did you find out about the Sierra Madre?
DDM00001707	It started with... a setback. Fires, blood, beneath the sun... a sun so close you could touch it.
DDM00001708	Moments like that, however, failures... can provide the brightest clarity.
DDM00001709	Then we better get to killing them.
DDM00001710	Hnh. Perhaps... perhaps I was too quick to put a collar on a potential ally.
DDM00001711	Very well. I'll come down... and show you what the Sierra Madre has in store.
DDM00001712	I don't care about the Republic, they're yours to kill.
DDM00001713	I know that. Their days were numbered since they occupied Hoover Dam.
DDM00001714	[NCR] If you want to kill NCR, that's fine with me.
DDM00001715	I've read your Pip-Boy. Seen what you've done...
DDM00001716	If you wish to end them... I could use someone like you. Resourceful. Uncompromising. NCR has many soldiers... many citizens.
DDM00001717	You want to attack NCR? All of NCR?
DDM00001718	Attack? No, not attack them. Wipe the slate clean. Make the Mojave like it was meant to be... undisturbed by man.
DDM00001719	I'll send the Cloud, the Holograms. Bring ruin in my hands until only I stand atop the HELIOS One tower again.
DDM00001720	I'll scour Hoover Dam with the Cloud, rain its walls with spears from the sun... with an army of Old World ghosts behind me, Holograms all.
DDM00001721	I'll kill them until it's only me, me alone... in a quiet world. In a world that's nothing like what happened at HELIOS One.
DDM00001722	You're Veronica's mentor. The Elder who lost HELIOS One.
DDM00001723	Veronica... she... survived HELIOS. She would. Resourceful.
DDM00001724	As for "losing" HELIOS One... that was the only outcome, aside from retreat. NCR, swarming like ants over Old World relics... Hoover Dam... HELIOS...
DDM00001725	I won't let those... children seize anything else. Hardin... McNamara... can't stop them... won't. So I will, with the Old World as my weapons.
DDM00001726	What the hell are you motioning about?
DDM00001727	I have no idea what your problem is.
DDM00001728	[Her face becomes angry. She points at the elevator, points downward, then wraps her arms around her and shakes her head.]
DDM00001729	[Perception] It reminds you of being trapped in the Auto-Doc.
DDM00001730	[She turns to you, relieved, and nods... then she turns away, and her face crumbles. She makes motions with her fingers, then clenches her fists.]
DDM00001731	What's wrong?
DDM00001732	[Christine studies the elevator frame, raises her hands... then sets them down... then raises them up again.]
DDM00001733	[She gives a silent sigh of exasperation, and frowns at the elevator, and her hand brushes the side of her face, tracing the scar.]
DDM00001734	Get in that elevator or I'll make those scars on your face a pleasant memory.
DDM00001735	[Christine takes a step back from your gaze... her eyes widen in alarm, she takes one step, then two toward the elevator.]
DDM00001736	I mean it. Stay alive until I get back.
DDM00001737	I'll be back for you, okay?
DDM00001738	[Christine tilts her head slightly, glances at your collar, then your Pip-Boy. She opens her mouth, frowns, then closes it.]
DDM00001739	[Her face looks sad, and she taps her chest once, slowly. She nods at you, then the exit.]
DDM00001740	Yeah, "thumbs up" - you better appreciate it.
DDM00001741	We'll get through this.
DDM00001742	All right, be ready.
DDM00001743	[She narrows her eyes, determined, and gives a last nod.]
DDM00001744	Not in a hand-holding mood right now.
DDM00001745	[She frowns, then waves you away and focuses on the terminal.]
DDM00001746	<Take her hand.>
DDM00001747	[She holds it, meeting your eyes intently for a few moments. She gives your hand a gentle squeeze, then releases it and smiles slightly.]
DDM00001748	Are you going to be okay here?
DDM00001749	[She nods... then gestures at your hand, offers hers.]
DDM00001750	I'm not one for church, but there's a bell tower to the north that has a nice view of the Sierra Madre. Well, did, anyway.
DDM00001751	Now, there's a view. Hello, beautiful.
DDM00001752	Bones. Dog not like bones, don't taste good... unless meat on them.
DDM00001753	Cage over there with things to pull, hard to pull, Dog can do it. Done it before? Not remember.
DDM00001754	Surprised these homes weren't robbed blind, folks leaving the key out like that. If only the Sierra Madre'd done the same.
DDM00001755	[Christine taps her collar, makes a sweeping gesture at the area, then begins to pulse her fingers outward, faster and faster.]
DDM00001756	You smell gas? I smell gas. Might be a valve nearby, we can use it to torch any locals that come near us.
DDM00001757	Place with hard to pull things is over there... "W" on your wrist thing? Weh-st. West.
DDM00001758	For now, just say the words, and let's settle this so we can go home.
DDM00001759	Don't tell me where you're going - I'll find you after this.
DDM00001760	I... never mind. Let me get the vault open... "Begin again... but know when to let go." Sounds like you.
DDM00001761	Fine. If you can't let him go, you don't leave me much choice.
DDM00001762	He won't escape, I swear.
DDM00001763	Christine, please, let go of this. Let me deal with him.
DDM00001764	All right. All right, I'll... but I'll need to leave this floor. He'll pick up my collar, and...
DDM00001765	Then I need to keep you from doing it.
DDM00001766	I... I didn't want this to happen. Ending him is more important than saving you. For what it's worth... I'm sorry.
DDM00001767	If you try and kill him, I can't let you do it. If you die, you'll kill us both.
DDM00001768	I can't. It's my mission, has been. This has to be done.
DDM00001769	Let him come through the suites, follow me. If he escapes, you'll still be here, waiting.
DDM00001770	You have to promise me. Promise me you'll deal with him... if I see him, I...
DDM00001771	If he kills you, I won't be able to get out.
DDM00001772	I know. And he will kill me, I can't get the collar off. Even if I could, I need to be sure - see his eyes, his face, when he dies.
DDM00001773	Do you trust me? If you do, let go of this.
DDM00001774	I can't let go. Every time I've thought about it...
DDM00001775	I've lost him so many times. He needs to die... what happened here, with us? He's... he's done so much worse.
DDM00001776	Are... are you all right? Something seems off.
DDM00001777	[SUCCEEDED] I...
DDM00001778	That's why you're waiting. You're going to kill him.
DDM00001779	[FAILED] No... no, you have it wrong. Look, it's now or never, all right? Let me open the elevator.
DDM00001780	He'll come here, to the Suites - when he does, let him go through.
DDM00001781	I... can't let him leave here. Look, you've done so much, and he's not going to show himself until you go down there.
DDM00001782	That's what I'm counting on.
DDM00001783	"Begin again, but know when to let go." Let's see what happens.
DDM00001784	We'll see. I'll take care of him.
DDM00001785	You ready? The sequence is: "Begin." "Again." "Let." "Go."
DDM00001786	The target's the vault, not the casino, right?
DDM00001787	Guess it's the object of someone's obsession - or affection.
DDM00001788	I believe he loved her, wanted to protect her. Too much.
DDM00001789	Love makes people do strange things. Won't argue that. It can drive you crazy sometimes if you can't... connect.
DDM00001790	If they loved each other, and they were together... I suppose that's all that mattered.
DDM00001791	But she's in that side room, dead, because the casino wouldn't let her leave. And who knows where he is.
DDM00001792	If we stay here, the Cloud and the Holograms will answer that.
DDM00001793	What does that mean?
DDM00001794	I've got you to come down after me, it'll respond to your voice.
DDM00001795	I... just wanted to make sure you're ready. When you go down there, that may be it for us... we won't be needed anymore.
DDM00001796	The one who made these collars, he'll follow you down there. And he won't let you leave. He's not one for sharing, never was.
DDM00001797	I have no idea, let's unlock it. The phrase is contained in the lyrics to a song.
DDM00001798	All right. If you go down there, are you prepared... what if you don't come back?
DDM00001799	Maybe it was a trust issue? He built this place for her, it feels like.
DDM00001800	It's possible. This place is immense... and it still has power, food dispensers, security... was it all for Pre-War guests? Or for her?
DDM00001801	This place... I'm not sure, it doesn't feel like a casino. Not entirely.
DDM00001802	I know. The sealed doors, the security... it's almost a fortress. Think that's why we're being ordered to come here and crack it open?
DDM00001803	I need you here, so sit tight.
DDM00001804	I dealt with the others, and I've got the key phrase.
DDM00001805	Surprised that Super Mutant didn't eat you... and don't get me started on Dean.
DDM00001806	So... I just rasp out some words, and the vault opens? That woman, the starlet... she didn't build this place, why would the builder do that?
DDM00001807	[Christine stops, glances at the speaker, then glances at your collar, frowning.]
DDM00001808	Great. How romantic.
DDM00001809	[She looks puzzled for a second, then glares at you and motions you to move on.]
DDM00001810	Yeah, speaker static makes our heads blow off, right.
DDM00001811	[SUCCEEDED] [She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
DDM00001812	You can interfere with the detonation signal from the speakers?
DDM00001813	[FAILED] [She frowns, shakes her head.]
DDM00001814	...but only between us.
DDM00001815	It's just your frequency.
DDM00001816	[She nods, once, then again, points at the two of you, then the Pip-Boy.]
DDM00001817	Got it, let's move on.
DDM00001818	[She nods, and motions for you to go ahead.]
DDM00001819	Does that work with any other collar?
DDM00001820	[She frowns, slowly shakes her head - she opens her mouth, then makes the motion of tuning a dial, then points at herself.]
DDM00001821	You... uh...speakers make a tempo... or...?
DDM00001822	[SUCCEEDED] [She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
DDM00001823	You can interfere with the Speaker's detonation frequency somehow?
DDM00001824	[FAILED] [She frowns, shakes her head.]
DDM00001825	What? You can make the speakers stop or something?
DDM00001826	[She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
DDM00001827	You can dampen the signal somehow?
DDM00001828	[FAILED] [She frowns, shakes her head.]
DDM00001829	I don't understand.
DDM00001830	[She tries to open her mouth and nothing comes out. Her eyes narrow and her hands ball into fists.]
DDM00001831	[She touches her collar, then shakes her head in frustration and nods at you to go ahead.]
DDM00001832	Come on, we need to keep moving.
DDM00001833	What? What now?
DDM00001834	It's a decayed speaker. If we stay too long near one, it'll go off.
DDM00001835	[She taps the collar and then opens and closes her hand really fast.]
DDM00001836	[She taps her collar, then opens and closes her hand really fast.]
DDM00001837	[She points at your Pip-Boy, her collar, and then your collar. After a second, then she opens and closes her hand slower.]
DDM00001838	[She points at your collar, then hers, then nods at your Pip-Boy. She makes a triangle motion, then the same slow pulse as before with her fingers.]
DDM00001839	There's something else I wanted to know.
DDM00001840	What happened next?
DDM00001841	After that... I wandered, alone. Saw the storms of the Divide, walked among the Ciphers of the West. Traveled to the Big Empty.
DDM00001842	I heard the signal. The woman's voice, the Sierra Madre, promising a chance to begin again, reverse my fortunes. All... nonsense.
DDM00001843	I tracked the signal. Came here, scouted the city... using other hands. Kept dying on me, killing each other. You - you got the farthest of all.
DDM00001844	Before this goes any farther, I had questions.
DDM00001845	If you want me to wait, I'll cooperate. The Sierra Madre doesn't matter to me.
DDM00001846	Hmm... compliance. Good. The others... fought, argued. If they had only obeyed...
DDM00001847	I see the collar has done its work, I can hear it in your voice. Stand and wait outside the Vault, where I can see you from the elevator.
DDM00001848	Foresight, whatever it is, won't help you spot me.
DDM00001849	[SUCCEEDED] I've had enough... enough of others stealing from me.
DDM00001850	I've gotten past everything the Sierra Madre's thrown at me. You're no different.
DDM00001851	[FAILED] As long as you're wearing that collar, you're not far from me. A press of a button, and I'll find you - I'll just listen for the explosion.
DDM00001852	Yeah... well... I'll pick this lock, no matter how tough.
DDM00001853	[SUCCEEDED] I've had enough... enough of others stealing from me.
DDM00001854	You know the Sierra Madre's a huge combination lock. Me? I've almost cracked it.
DDM00001855	[FAILED] Take all the time you need. I suspect the Sierra Madre is more than proof against bobby pins and crowbars.
DDM00001856	So there is a lock? Good. Wasn't sure until you said so.
DDM00001857	Find a way inside - you can try. The Sierra Madre is a patient thing, and it has outlasted many who've come to its doors.
DDM00001858	The punishment often equals the reward for those without the foresight to see what's in store. I'll let you test the security, see how you stand up.
DDM00001859	The size of the lock doesn't matter, only the contents.
DDM00001860	Fine, stay up there and wait. I'll keep busy down here.
DDM00001861	As long as you can find me, you mean.
DDM00001862	[SUCCEEDED] Hiding in the Sierra Madre... an interesting thought. I'd come to see it more as a prison.
DDM00001863	Hide, flee... it doesn't matter. The Sierra Madre is patient. I can be as well. You won't get any farther inside, and you won't escape my sight.
DDM00001864	You'd have to find me first. The Sierra Madre basement's bigger than you'd expect.
DDM00001865	[FAILED] As long as you're wearing that collar, you're not far from me. A press of a button, and I'll find you - I'll just listen for the explosion.
DDM00001866	If it has a lock... and it should... I can pick it. Somehow.
DDM00001867	[SUCCEEDED] This casino isn't some caravan safe. And the lock that secures the Sierra Madre vault doesn't hold all its secrets.
DDM00001868	I already managed to unlock the elevator and get down here before you. Better hurry.
DDM00001869	[FAILED] Take all the time you need. I suspect the Sierra Madre is more than proof against bobby pins and crowbars.
DDM00001870	Time is a commodity you don't have.
DDM00001871	But all of that - all of that wasn't an obstacle, it drove you here.
DDM00001872	You're right, you have everything - except the vault.
DDM00001873	If you seek to goad me... impatience and greed led you here, not me, it doesn't control me as it does you.
DDM00001874	I won't fall prey to another trap - either the Sierra Madre, or yours. There is no trust between us, and there will be no trades, either.
DDM00001875	No traps, just a trade, you and the vault, me and the exit.
DDM00001876	[SUCCEEDED] I... I have earned it, fought for it. Paid for it in blood, mine, others - countless times.
DDM00001877	Greed implies you want more than you deserve. You've earned this.
DDM00001878	[FAILED] Let you go? To crawl back to whatever caravan whore spawned you? No, she was perhaps more talented in deals than you.
DDM00001879	But... look, I want to cooperate, all right? Come down.
DDM00001880	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. The collars... yes. Technology solves so many ills.
DDM00001881	The collar's done its work, or we wouldn't be at this point.
DDM00001882	[FAILED] Enough talking, save your energy. You'll be down there for a while.
DDM00001883	I've cooperated so far. You've made sure of that.
DDM00001884	Both of us working together has allowed us to get this far.
DDM00001885	You're right, it will be different - has been different.
DDM00001886	True... the collars... have worked better than I'd hoped. With adjustments.
DDM00001887	Still... I'm not eager to leap into another trap - the Sierra Madre's or yours. This experience has taught me human nature is... unreliable.
DDM00001888	You say your freedom is important to you - so did the others that fill the Villa, before they turned on each other.
DDM00001889	Look, let me out, you get in the vault, we're both happy.
DDM00001890	[SUCCEEDED] That signal... that siren's call... lured me in, yes. And being trapped in the Sierra Madre, perhaps forever...
DDM00001891	That has made me more - cautious. I have my freedom, access to the bottom of the casino, and you, under my control. Heh... I can wait.
DDM00001892	You followed the signal, too. You want what's down here, I want out. Let's deal.
DDM00001893	[FAILED] If you want to appease me, then do so in silence. I'll come for you, in time. Irritate me, and I'll silence you forever.
DDM00001894	What can I say to convince you I just want to go?
DDM00001895	[SUCCEEDED] I've lost much in the past by... falling to my instincts. This time... this time will be different.
DDM00001896	You've already waited too long for this moment, there's no need to wait any longer.
DDM00001897	[FAILED] Silence and patience will convince me. I'll come for you, in time. Irritate me, and I'll silence you forever.
DDM00001898	Having you wait up there forever with no way down sounds more appealing all the time.
DDM00001899	Throwing a wrench into the works is what I do best.
DDM00001900	If that's what it takes to fix this, that's fine with me.
DDM00001901	Even... even if you damaged the mechanism... there's a chance of repairing it. It might take years... but it's possible.
DDM00001902	Well... then you'd need some way of transmitting that, right?
DDM00001903	[SUCCEEDED] Huh... clever.
DDM00001904	I'll clip the wires to this intercom, then the Pip-Boy.
DDM00001905	[FAILED] Indeed... and how would I reach you, let alone speak to you. Perhaps you're not as resourceful as I suspected.
DDM00001906	Um... are you sure of the frequency?
DDM00001907	[SUCCEEDED] Huh... clever.
DDM00001908	There's noticeable lag of several seconds for the collar to go off - and a warning.
DDM00001909	[FAILED] Quite certain. How you managed to come all this way amazes me - perhaps it was luck.
DDM00001910	Safeguards? If you're a gambling man now, stay up in the casino.
DDM00001911	Destroying even a single fragment of data is more than you could stand.
DDM00001912	Maybe too many safeguards, as you've discovered already.
DDM00001913	But, you recognize the value of what's down there. You would no sooner destroy what's inside the Sierra Madre than destroy yourself.
DDM00001914	Persist in threatening me... or the Sierra Madre's secrets, you're of no use to me, I'll set off your collar now.
DDM00001915	Wait until I get my hands on the computers, we'll see.
DDM00001916	[SUCCEEDED] You might destroy access to the data... not the data itself. Besides, there would be safeguards in place.
DDM00001917	All it takes is destroying a single terminal or holotape.
DDM00001918	[FAILED] There's nothing you can do that I cannot undo... or recover. And I have the time now, thanks to you.
DDM00001919	I'll trash the electronics, the vault wiring, maybe.
DDM00001920	[SUCCEEDED] The elevator. Then you'd be trapped for certain, no probability of escape.
DDM00001921	Forget the Vault. The elevator's only a single control box.
DDM00001922	[FAILED] The vault would be as shielded against vandalism just as the casino itself was. No... any damage you could cause would be minimal.
DDM00001923	You... you don't have any way to transmit down here.
DDM00001924	[SUCCEEDED] Huh... clever.
DDM00001925	Between floors? I don't think so.
DDM00001926	[FAILED] Really? No, I don't think so. I can afford to wait, and your threats... meaningless.
DDM00001927	Oh, so you're willing to risk it?
DDM00001928	Denying you the Sierra Madre vault would be worth it.
DDM00001929	Sounds like I'm dead anyway, the way you're talking.
DDM00001930	Kill yourself, and you decide this now. I can shut down your signal, prevent the collar from going off.
DDM00001931	I... I'm pretty sure I can do some damage down here. Somehow.
DDM00001932	[SUCCEEDED] The collar? Even if you could trigger it... no, you'd die.
DDM00001933	We'll see how "protected" the Vault is when I detonate this collar.
DDM00001934	[FAILED] Really? No, I don't think so. I can afford to wait, and your threats... meaningless.
DDM00001935	Then I'll find a way to unlock the secrets of this vault, take them for myself.
DDM00001936	You've gotten far. Any farther, try to breach the vault, you'll become a corpse.
DDM00001937	What's inside is mine. Anyone else touches it... tries to take it from me... they'll answer for it.
DDM00001938	I'm not interested in the vault, I only want to leave.
DDM00001939	Then all you need to do is wait, be patient. Hnh... you may be down there for a while. Just as I was, trapped inside the casino.
DDM00001940	Consider this punishment for following the Sierra Madre signal in the first place. So eager to rush ahead... now, enjoy your reward.
DDM00001941	Unless you come down here, I'll destroy the vault, everything in it.
DDM00001942	No... I don't think so. It'd most likely trigger other security measures... if you hurt the Vault at all.
DDM00001943	The builder of the casino built it to last - the Sierra Madre withstood the war. I'm sure the Vault is protected as well.
DDM00001944	Besides, you wouldn't have followed the signal if you didn't want this place's secrets for your own. You're curious... past the threats.
DDM00001945	[Christine nods at the Vending Machine, then makes a sweeping gesture with both arms and draws them to her chest.]
DDM00001946	[Christine's eyes dart around at the walls and the ceiling. She glances at the exit, then takes a slow breath. Sweat appears on her brow.]
DDM00001947	I am all about keeping low in this section of town... so let's see about creeping by the locals, all right?
DDM00001948	Tired of being inside. Want outside, get food inside Dog.
DDM00001949	Nice spot for sunning. Well, if the sun ever touched here.
DDM00001950	If your marker's right, think the roost we're looking for is to the southeast.
DDM00001951	[Christine frowns, looks upward, then back at you. She nods her head upwards, then makes the motion of holding a gun at the ready.]
DDM00001952	Why leave a bear trap here, so high up. Someone's arm must have lost it.
DDM00001953	Ah, aren't the trees lovely this time of year, all blooming and green...
DDM00001954	[Christine flicks her finger back and forth quickly like a switch, then nods to the north.]
DDM00001955	This is the place you need to go when everyone is in place. Until then... nothing more than a diseased view of the Sierra Madre.
DDM00001956	Can you hear me...? Damn transceivers... let me link the collars to the speaker in the tower... then... there.
DDM00001957	[You hear banging from the speaker, as if someone is hammering on a wall with their fists.]
DDM00001958	[You hear a tapping from the speaker... a series of sharp taps, then a slow, two taps.]
DDM00001959	I'll pull the switches. And when I find you, I'll pull your head from your body.
DDM00001960	Ready. The both of us. I'll keep Dog locked in his cage... you just open the Sierra Madre.
DDM00001961	Dog is scared... wants out of cage. Cage you put me in. Will pull levers, be good, just let Dog out.
DDM00001962	Dog is ready to be good, pull switches, see the lights.
DDM00001963	What are you waiting for? Rubbing it in? Strike up the band already.
DDM00001964	Careful when you do... you think the Villa's bad now, you haven't seen anything yet.
DDM00001965	Come on, partner. So close now, stage is set, strike up the band.
DDM00001966	Just get ready to run when you do... I sure will. Think the Villa's bad now... you haven't seen half the hell this town can raise.
DDM00001967	There's no need for any of that, let's get out of here.
DDM00001968	If you try to burn the voice out of you, this casino will be destroyed, and us along with it.
DDM00001969	Dog is tired of voice inside, tired of being in another cage, again. Try to...
DDM00001970	...kill this human, Dog. Kill them. If this casino is destroyed, good, it'll kill the Old Man, too, the one who...
DDM00001971	...shouts at Dog, the voice shouts, and to stop the voice, Dog needs to burn it out.
DDM00001972	Dog, if you do this, you'll kill yourself.
DDM00001973	...do this? Yes, he can. You caused this - coddled him, protected him, now I'm going to have to take control from...
DDM00001974	...you, you need to go, run. Dog is going to burn voice... burn voice out, burn it away.
DDM00001975	...and Dog looks just like me. You've hurt yourself. Inside. Do you see now, see...
DDM00001976	...in the water. Dog understands now. Dog knows what happened.
DDM00001977	He's right. If you merge us, then... I... we... or whatever we become... we can't help you when you reach whatever's at the Sierra Madre's end.
DDM00001978	And Dog... Dog doesn't want to unremember you, may forget you.
DDM00001979	We will forget almost all that has happened here. You'll be alone - at the Old Man's mercy. Like Dog. Like me.
DDM00001980	...to stop you. You think your pull is stronger than mine? No... no, I've minded Dog, protected him far longer than you ever have. He won't...
DDM00001981	...listen to you. If Master sent you, Dog is listening.
DDM00001982	...him, just as I do. Do you understand now? Do you understand why I have to take control? He...
DDM00001983	...why keep hurting self, voice keeps... telling Dog to do things. Dog just wants voice to go away... away.
DDM00001984	...too late. Too late for us... too late for you to do anything but...
DDM00001985	...listen to you. Your voice... Dog will listen to you.
DDM00001986	Take that chain around your neck, grab the ends, and pull slow and hard until you hear a crack.
DDM00001987	Yes, Dog can do that. Dog hopes to see you soon.
DDM00001988	The other voice? See it in your head - not as a voice, but as a ball, the size of your hand.
DDM00001989	Dog... Dog never thought of the voice as... small. As something he could hold...
DDM00001990	...on for much longer. What are you doing? What...
DDM00001991	...do you want Dog to do? Voice is small now, Dog... Dog could... Dog choke the voice, crush it into red mash.
DDM00001992	Dog, listen to the other voice inside now. Go to sleep, let him come out.
DDM00001993	If... if other voice comes out... Dog... Dog won't wake up. Dog doesn't want to sleep, please don't make him...
DDM00001994	...go to sleep. Good. Yes... make him sleep. Please...
DDM00001995	...don't make me go to sleep. I... Dog is tired. Dog is tired, can't... keep eyes open. Sleep... Dog needs to sleep.
DDM00001996	No, look, I wasn't the one who caged you here, all right?
DDM00001997	[SUCCEEDED] Master? Master... Dog... Dog is listening.
DDM00001998	Dog, the Master sent me. He commands you to listen to my voice now.
DDM00001999	[FAILED] No... no, you put Dog here, you keep him here! Like other cages you put Dog in!
DDM00002000	Dog... stay back, listen to me.
DDM00002001	[SUCCEEDED]Hnnh? Master? Don't want Master to be mad... what does Master want Dog to...
DDM00002002	Dog! Stop! Or Master will be mad!
DDM00002003	[FAILED] No... Dog no listen to you, no listen to your voice anymore - will tear you apart, feed on you.
DDM00002004	Ready for more? Come on, let's finish this.
DDM00002005	Nrrrrrrh... rhhhhharrhhh!
DDM00002006	Forget this. Come on, let's fight, you big reject.
DDM00002007	I can't do it - fighting's more merciful than this.
DDM00002008	Master needs you to pull on the chain on your neck as hard as you can.
DDM00002009	Yes, Master. Dog hopes to see you soon.
DDM00002010	Dog... listen to me... don't do this.
DDM00002011	[SUCCEEDED] Hnnh? Master? Don't want Master to be mad... what does Master want Dog to...
DDM00002012	Dog! Stay! If you don't, Master will be mad!
DDM00002013	[FAILED] Dog tired of listening to you - put you in cage, piece by piece.
DDM00002014	I don't plan on running, it's time to kill you both.
DDM00002015	Come on, then. I won't make it easy on you.
DDM00002016	Dog will crush you, snap your bones, make red everywhere.
DDM00002017	You've heard of the Sierra Madre Casino.
DDM00002018	We all have, the legend, the curses.
DDM00002019	Some foolishness about it lying in the middle of a City of Dead.
DDM00002020	A city of ghosts.
DDM00002021	Beneath a blood-red cloud...
DDM00002022	...a bright, shining monument, reaching out, luring treasure hunters to their doom. An illusion.
DDM00002023	A promise that you can change your fortunes. Begin again.
DDM00002024	Finding it, though, that's not the hard part.
DDM00002025	It's letting go.
DDM00002026	It's letting go.
DDM00002027	It's letting go.
DDM00002028	It's letting go.
DDM00002029	It's letting go.
DDM00002030	You've heard of the Sierra Madre Casino.
DDM00002031	We all have, the legend, the curses. Some foolishness about it lying in the middle of a City of Dead.
DDM00002032	A city of ghosts. Buried beneath a blood-red cloud... a bright, shining monument luring treasure hunters to their doom.
DDM00002033	An illusion that you can begin again, change your fortunes.
DDM00002034	Finding it, though, that's not the hard part.
DDM00002035	It's letting go.
DDM00002036	The survivors of the Sierra Madre thought about gathering at the Fountain and waiting for the Courier.
DDM00002037	In the end, the collars' silence made them uneasy, and the fear of turning on each other made them hesitate, and leave the goodbyes - unspoken.
DDM00002038	The radio message at the fountain was enough for them, and there was no need to add another farewell on top of all they had suffered.
DDM00002039	You've heard stories of the Sierra Madre Casino. We all have.
DDM00002040	This story's different than the others. It's all in promise of beginnings. And the ending.
DDM00002041	In the years that followed, the legend of the Sierra Madre faded, and there were no... new visitors to the city.
DDM00002042	Years later, when a mysterious blood red cloud began to roll across the Mojave, then West toward the Republic, no one knew where it had come from.
DDM00002043	Only that it brought death in its wake. Attempts to find the source of the toxic cloud failed.
DDM00002044	The Mojave was cut off. Through the Cloud, lights were seen from HELIOS One.
DDM00002045	There were stories of ghosts immune to gunfire, who struck down anyone they saw with rays of light.
DDM00002046	The last chapter of the Mojave came when a modified REPCONN rocket struck Hoover Dam, releasing a blood-red cloud, killing all stationed there.
DDM00002047	All attempts to penetrate the Cloud and re-take the Dam failed, and both the NCR and Legion finally turned away from it, citing the place as cursed.
DDM00002048	In the years that followed, communities across the West began to die as traces of the Cloud began to drift over lands held by the NCR.
DDM00002049	Only two remained alive in the depths of the Cloud, at the Sierra Madre, waiting for their new world to begin again.
DDM00002050	The Courier, lured by the promise of the Sierra Madre, could not escape. Once inside the vault, the casino did not let go.
DDM00002051	When the Courier finally passed away, the casino created a new Hologram to walk with the other ghosts that filled its casino.
DDM00002052	It was a pre-programmed homage intended for another. It assumed a new meaning in the likeness of the Courier.
DDM00002053	A means of allowing even the dead to begin again.
DDM00002054	Hnnhhhh... Dog getting full.
DDM00002055	OM NOM NOM
DDM00002056	Rhrrrrrr...
DDM00002057	RhhhhaaarrrRRRRRRRR!
DDM00002058	Show's about to begin. People, take your places.
DDM00002059	I'm ready. Everyone - trigger the event.
DDM00002060	Finally. Now, the gates will open. And so will the skies.
DDM00002061	Let's do this. On the count of three... two... one.
DDM00002062	<Give two taps back.>
DDM00002063	Only a little longer, and we'll open the casino.
DDM00002064	Christine? We're almost ready here.
DDM00002065	[A single tap comes from the speaker, then silence.]
DDM00002066	Must be you, Christine. Sit tight, not like you have a choice.
DDM00002067	Save your energy, we still have to pull this off.
DDM00002068	Now, now... I'll let you out when the event's over. Maybe.
DDM00002069	[The hammering stops for a second... and there's one final bang from the speaker, as if someone is smashing their fist into a wall.]
DDM00002070	Fine, don't take too long, or it'll be a short recovery, trust me.
DDM00002071	If you get the strength to leave, do so - quickly.
DDM00002072	Go on and rest. I have to take care of something.
DDM00002073	Thank you... for whatever you have done. I will remain here, need to get my strength back.
DDM00002074	We're trapped inside a casino in a poisonous city.
DDM00002075	A cage... but at least you're not in two of them now.
DDM00002076	That... that was not the answer I was expecting.
DDM00002077	It'd take too long to explain.
DDM00002078	I feel as if I've woken up.
DDM00002079	I don't know you, yet I feel like I do, and a feeling of... gratitude. I... forgive me, I... I'm wounded. This chain... this bear trap on my arm...
DDM00002080	...how did I even get this far with these wounds? The pain is excruciating, I... I need to rest for a moment.
DDM00002081	Your voice... it's different.
DDM00002082	Are you all right?
DDM00002083	Dog?
DDM00002084	Who... who are you? What is this place?
DDM00002085	Just go before I change my mind.
DDM00002086	I promise I'll try not to get killed.
DDM00002087	We came this far, I'll manage. Go on, let go.
DDM00002088	You were there all the time...
DDM00002089	...all the time, you were there, and so close...
DDM00002090	...together.
DDM00002091	Then I don't want you to merge, I need you here... Dog, listen to my voice. Dog?
DDM00002092	Dog understands. Need help, need Dog in case.
DDM00002093	Of course. You... we might not get through this, otherwise. Need to survive, no matter what the cost. Now... now...
DDM00002094	I don't want you to be under anyone's control, even mine.
DDM00002095	Not having your help doesn't matter if this heals you.
DDM00002096	Dog understands... Dog has done... bad things, knows why voice was...
DDM00002097	...furious with him. Tired of the anger. Thank you... Courier. Even if it's only for minutes before the Sierra Madre kills us all, then...
DDM00002098	...Dog hopes you find a way to save self, like you help Dog, and...
DDM00002099	...when you meet him, find a way to save yourself, as you tried to save us. Otherwise, I'll be upset with you.
DDM00002100	Now that you see, I want you to step back, listen to the voice again.
DDM00002101	Do you know what happens if you go into the water, Dog?
DDM00002102	Then... step into the water, step into yourself.
DDM00002103	If Dog... if Dog goes into the water... Dog can't help if Master gets mad. You were nice to Dog, Dog wants to help.
DDM00002104	Try to picture the voice, inside, and, uh, turn in and look at it.
DDM00002105	[SUCCEEDED] Dog can see the voice. Looks just like Dog...
DDM00002106	Imagine the voice, not as a voice... but as water. Look at the voice now, what do you see?
DDM00002107	[FAILED] Dog... Dog does not understand. Voice? The other voice? What do you want Dog to do.
DDM00002108	As long as you're not planning to blow up the casino now, great.
DDM00002109	Now, if you've got him on a leash, I need to finish things here.
DDM00002110	Are you going to be all right?
DDM00002111	Things here... are... under control. Find the one that dragged us here, end him.
DDM00002112	That's it, sleep, reject. Sleep like the dead.
DDM00002113	Goodnight, Dog. You won't wake up, ever again.
DDM00002114	Close your eyes, and only open them if the voice tells you.
DDM00002115	You did it. You... I don't feel him struggling anymore... I'm in pain, and... I hate to say it, I'm starving, but... I'm not fighting him.
DDM00002116	All I wanted was him to listen to me, take care of him, keep him from hurting himself...
DDM00002117	Now I can. One day, when he's ready, I'll let him out. When we... understand each other.
DDM00002118	Good... well done, Dog. I'm pleased. Now stay.
DDM00002119	I have some unfinished business. Are you going to be all right?
DDM00002120	Yes, well, it had to be done. Now, I need you to remain here.
DDM00002121	Now Dog speak. Now Dog not afraid. And... hungry. More hungry.
DDM00002122	Dog will obey. Dog will stay here... for now.
DDM00002123	After... after that, Dog find food... tear apart food, eat. Chase it down, can't run, feed. Finally, until Dog is full.
DDM00002124	Aren't you hungry? Go on - feed, piece by piece.
DDM00002125	No, hold it tightly by the neck - now sink your teeth into it, tear it apart.
DDM00002126	No. No, Dog, no...
DDM00002127	...knows now. Voice was always small... Dog could have torn it apart, eaten it all this time, tear it...
DDM00002128	...apart, Dog... we cannot be apart, you need if... hnnnh... hrrhhaharrrrr... 
DDM00002129	...Dog... Dog is... empty. The voice... Dog is hungrier than ever...
DDM00002130	I... he's asleep. Finally. Shhhhhh.
DDM00002131	Dog... all I wanted was for you to listen to me, let me care for you. Keep you from hurting yourself...
DDM00002132	Now I can. And one day, when you're ready, I'll let you out. When you're calm, and we... understand each other.
DDM00002133	And we're at peace, you and I, mind and instinct. Then the world will be ready for us.
DDM00002134	Hello? Voice? You there? It's Dog......Dog can hear himself. Voice is... is in cage? Locked.
DDM00002135	Now Dog speak. Now Dog not afraid. And... hungry. More hungry.
DDM00002136	Dog find food... tear apart food, eat. Chase it down, can't run, feed. Finally, until Dog is full.
DDM00002137	What is this place?
DDM00002138	Feel strange, like... sleeping. On my neck, is this... a chain? I... what's carved on my chest?
DDM00002139	"God." No... not God. Something in reverse... hnh. Was that one of them...?
DDM00002140	Should rest, get my strength back... then explore this place, see what it holds.
DDM00002141	Maybe you just... uh... need to hear another voice, like mine.
DDM00002142	[SUCCEEDED] Master? Master, Dog hoped you come, voice... voice is going...
DDM00002143	Dog, Master is here now, Master wants you to stop this.
DDM00002144	[FAILED] No... Dog is my creature, and he's more than enough to end you here and now.
DDM00002145	Look, listen to my voice, maybe... maybe I can help.
DDM00002146	[SUCCEEDED]You... were kind to Dog. Dog will listen... Dog is glad you came...
DDM00002147	Dog, I stopped because I don't want to hurt you - now listen. I want to help.
DDM00002148	I don't mean you any harm... you just need to calm down, focus.
DDM00002149	Dog tried. Just hard... hard to hear over voice sometimes... so loud... pain... pain...
DDM00002150	...won't shut me out, Dog. It won't silence me. This human... both of them, they mean to...
DDM00002151	...help Dog, please. Please.
DDM00002152	Forget it. I'm sick of dragging you around anyway.
DDM00002153	Dog knows... please... help Dog end the voice, Dog just wants it to go away. Dog...
DDM00002154	...and I have more in common than we know. Soon, you'll be inside Dog, just as I am.
DDM00002155	Bite down on it, chew until it's silent, then swallow it.
DDM00002156	Dog... don't do this, listen to me, my voice.
DDM00002157	[SUCCEEDED] Master? Master, Dog hoped you would come, voice... voice is going...
DDM00002158	Dog, Master is here now, Master wants you to stop this.
DDM00002159	[FAILED] Dog... Dog wants to, Dog does, but...
DDM00002160	Dog, that voice doesn't control you, all right?
DDM00002161	Dog tried to shut it out, tried to hurt self enough to make it...
DDM00002162	...quiet. Shhhhh, Dog. Let me handle this. I'll let you feed on this human when we're done.
DDM00002163	Fine, reject. You want to die? I'll accomodate you.
DDM00002164	Dog doesn't want to die. But the voice keeps shouting, and...
DDM00002165	You're not leaving me any choice, I have to stop you.
DDM00002166	Dog is sorry, so sorry, didn't want to, but...
DDM00002167	...it's time for you to realize who's in control here. First, we tear you apart - then this casino, and the Old Man with it.
DDM00002168	What are you, exactly? You're acting different than before.
DDM00002169	Dog and I take turns in the cage... one steps out, the other goes back in. Now - what do you want?
DDM00002170	Do you see these wounds of his, covering his skin...the bear trap on his arm? He placed his own hand in it.
DDM00002171	The name he carved in his chest? To remind him of who he is, he inflicts pain on himself to silence me, when all I try to do... Hrr!
DDM00002172	...he cuts, hurts, and tries to murder me out of him. He won't succeed. Just makes me angrier.
DDM00002173	Dog is the beast, we simply change cages. Like the ones here.
DDM00002174	Dog and I take turns in the cage... one steps out, the other goes back in.
DDM00002175	I heard electricity and radios can cause, uh, voices in people's heads.
DDM00002176	[SUCCEEDED] That's the easy explanation, the one humans use. Pre-War technology, as if it's the cause of all ills, mind and body.
DDM00002177	I needed to come out of the cage to protect Dog. From clever humans... like you.
DDM00002178	In Super Mutants, brain damage is usually the result of prolonged Stealth Boy usage.
DDM00002179	[FAILED] Perhaps. Or maybe I was here all the time, watching. Waiting for you.
DDM00002180	Did you hit your head or something? You're acting odd.
DDM00002181	[SUCCEEDED] Trauma... yes, in a manner of speaking.
DDM00002182	You have multiple personality disorder. Some trauma caused this?
DDM00002183	[FAILED] No... sometimes it simply wakes voices up.
DDM00002184	...going to make casino burn, no more being...
DDM00002185	...back in the cage. Stop what you're doing, we can...
DDM00002186	...can hear you now. Not much longer, not...
DDM00002187	...listening to me. Tired of being your minder, tired...
DDM00002188	...of putting Dog to sleep, he wakes up in cage, hungry, Dog wants...
DDM00002189	...to protect you, always wanted to protect you, the reason I have to take control is...
DDM00002190	...Master. Master set me free, Dog needs to...
DDM00002191	...listen to me. If you do this, we both...
DDM00002192	...die. Dog wants to die. Don't care anymore, tired of you, tired of place. Master will...
DDM00002193	...help us. Please let me help us. If you don't, then you're...
DDM00002194	[The Hologram nods.]
DDM00002195	Do you have anything I can buy?
DDM00002196	[The Hologram flickers in acknowledgement.]
DDM00002197	Goodbye.
DDM00002198	[Christine's eyes dart in the direction of the screeching sound. She looks frightened and trembles slightly, as if fighting an urge to run.]
DDM00002199	GREETING
DDM00002200	Be patient, I'm going. Maybe you should know when to let go.
DDM00002201	You made it, good. I'm getting tired of waiting for you - and Elijah. Surprised? Yeah... I made it here, just like you did.
DDM00002202	You made it, good... <Coughs>ugh.. Hurts to talk. I'll keep this quick in case my... voice goes out.
DDM00002203	You're back. You sure you still want me here, collars and all? Not much for waiting around with a bomb around my neck.
DDM00002204	I... I wish you luck in the Vault. Elijah... he's tough to pin down.
DDM00002205	[Christine is looking at the Fountain, her eyes narrowed. She then scans the courtyard perimeter, gauging the distance.]
DDM00002206	[She glances at your wrist, then back at the Fountain.]
DDM00002207	[The woman before you looks disoriented, pained - she blinks a few times, then winces, as if the act of blinking causes her pain.]
DDM00002208	[Christine points at the sky, makes a fist, then makes an explosion gesture with her fingers.]
DDM00002209	[Christine shakes her head, narrows her eyes, then points at your compass.]
DDM00002210	[Christine motions to you, points at the door uneasily, then makes a pulling motion with her hand. She seems hesitant to go near it.]
DDM00002211	[Christine looks at you warily.]
DDM00002212	[Christine glares at you.]
DDM00002213	[Christine raises an eyebrow.]
DDM00002214	[The flickering Hologram stares at you expectantly.]
DDM00002215	Dog will obey. Dog will stay here... for now.
DDM00002216	Things here... are... under control. Find the one that dragged us here, end him.
DDM00002217	Thank you... for whatever you have done. I will remain here, need to get my strength back.
DDM00002218	...Hnnnhrhhh... my voice... won't work, won't hold him, down, doesn't matter, won't help...
DDM00002219	...Hnnnhrhhh... he's gotten too strong, too scared... even my own voice won't help...
DDM00002220	You...? Master... no, not Master. Dog remembers you. Left Dog in cage, mean to Dog... now, Dog...
DDM00002221	You... you hurt Dog, keep hurting him. Dog hungry, not want to hurt any more... not want to...
DDM00002222	You...? Master... no, not Master. Dog remembers you. Kind to Dog... Dog can't...
DDM00002223	Kind to Dog... then hurt Dog... you hate Dog, hate...
DDM00002224	Master? Dog not hear you come in... too hungry, now... at cage door? Master, Dog is listening now you are close and he can hear you over hunger.
DDM00002225	I'll wait here until there's fires in the sky.
DDM00002226	Dog is waiting.
DDM00002227	You better have brought enough meat. I can feel Dog's teeth tearing at my ribs, hungry to get out.
DDM00002228	Why Dog eyes go black for bit. You talk to other voice?
DDM00002229	Dog wants out... Dog is hungry.
DDM00002230	Let Dog out. Hungry, hate being in here.
DDM00002231	So here we are. A row of switches all lined up. How familiar...
DDM00002232	...these switches won't move themselves, after all... there must be some trick to it. Now that I'm here... what do you expect me to do?
DDM00002233	Why are we here? Dog not want to be here... place too much like a cage for Dog.
DDM00002234	If Dog was fed like last time, Dog would listen. If the feeding was quiet.
DDM00002235	So... are we on our way to somewhere else...? A Gala Event, perhaps?
DDM00002236	Where are you taking Dog? Dog doesn't want to leave, heard Master... saw Master in sky.
DDM00002237	And when Master not there... woman at fountain... she is made of lines and light, want to watch.
DDM00002238	If it isn't the clever one. What do you want?
DDM00002239	You are the nice voice... kind to Dog. You keep the other Voice quiet.
DDM00002240	Remember you... you were mean to Dog, make Dog sleep... and other Voice come out.
DDM00002241	Hnh. Dog remember you.
DDM00002242	[You get no response.]
DDM00002243	Are you listening? Good. From now on, when I talk, listen - and follow my instructions.
DDM00002244	Play stupid, play clever, make the mistake of saying "no?" That collar on your neck'll go off and take your head with it.
DDM00002245	You've returned. Why? Gather the three as I've instructed, then I will have more for you - not before.
DDM00002246	Good, well done... now, for the festivities, and your parts in all this.
DDM00002247	The owner of the Sierra Madre... for whatever reason... keyed the Grand Opening to the Gala Event itself.
DDM00002248	It needs to be fired off in order for the casino doors to open. As I've discovered, one person can't do it.
DDM00002249	So, get your team into position indicated on your Pip-Boy, then trigger it properly.
DDM00002250	You're so close now, don't let me down. Otherwise, I'll have to rely on the next team.
DDM00002251	You. You're in the vault... finally. After all this time. The Sierra Madre... mine.
DDM00002252	Don't move, don't go into the vault. And don't touch anything else... there may be more traps down there... another security system.
DDM00002253	Enough talking.
DDM00002254	Whoever designed the Sierra Madre... their obsession with messing with frequencies and signals...
DDM00002255	I'm coming down - I'll meet you face to face at the vault entrance. If you resist, I'll use the collar, even if it puts the vault at risk.
DDM00002256	I'm coming down - I'll meet you face to face at the vault entrance. No tricks. If you prove troublesome, well... there's always the collar.
DDM00002257	I'm coming down, forget the Sierra Madre security, I'll find you myself. Try to break into the vault, I'll set off the collar.
DDM00002258	Curious? You must be. We have time, now that you've done your work. And our interactions have been too one-sided, even for my tastes.
DDM00002259	Ask! You still have time.
DDM00002260	This is the place you need to go when everyone is in place. Until then... nothing more than a diseased view of the Sierra Madre.
DDM00002261	Can you hear me...? Damn transceivers... let me link the collars to the speaker in the tower... then... there.
DDM00002262	So you showed. Felt the collar start kicking again as soon as the elevator doors rattled open.
DDM00002263	Think you're going to up-stage me, here at the Sierra Madre? I don't think so. Now that I'm inside... well, I don't need you anymore.
DDM00002264	Finally, a friendly face... hey! Partner! Up here.
DDM00002265	In a bit of a predicament here... had to duck backstage, take a powder, the audience is a little... murderous tonight.
DDM00002266	All right, you're resourceful, I'll give you that - it's going to take a lot more than juggling keys and shooting speakers to stop me.
DDM00002267	As I see it? All I need to do is kill you, then make a run for the exit. You do the same, you'll be clawing at the lock until your head blows off.
DDM00002268	So maybe you and I should have a little chat - just like we did when you first waltzed into town.
DDM00002269	Those electric ghosts aren't the kind of audience I like at the best of times - at least the ones in the Villa had manners.
DDM00002270	Don't even know how I ended up here... guess the casino still recognizes guests even after all this time, huh? How's that for history.
DDM00002271	Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure. This place is a dump! Lousy acoustics.
DDM00002272	Not now, we got bigger problems.
DDM00002273	Was that him floating above the Fountain, the boss man? The one who put these bowties on our necks?
DDM00002274	Sure does like to make a presentation... wish he'd keep it down, or else the Ghost People are going to swarm the gates, Vera Hologram or no.
DDM00002275	Have a seat, and then we'll talk.
DDM00002276	The Sierra Madre. Mmm... beauty, isn't she. She the one who invited you here?
DDM00002277	Or maybe you didn't catch her voice on the radio. Woke up, confused, like some of the others. Least you're still breathing.
DDM00002278	By the way, don't get up or make any sudden motions, no matter how uncomfortable that chair gets... the cushion's just for show.
DDM00002279	I'll hold up my end, don't you worry. We get to the Sierra Madre, it'll be a different tune, trust me.
DDM00002280	"Hold the wires, Dean." Talk about being a second stringer.
DDM00002281	So this is where I'm supposed to put on the show? Played better venues, let me tell you.
DDM00002282	What's that there... wiring? Looks... looks like it's tied to the sound system in the Villa, except for that snipped section there.
DDM00002283	So... what, I stand here, hold the two ends in my hands, and tap them together like cymbals?
DDM00002284	Didn't think much of our chances, now I'm thinking I was wrong. What's the next step?
DDM00002285	Well, now, if it isn't my ball, chain, and dog collar rolled all into one.
DDM00002286	You have that sad, questioning look in your eye. Not sure talking to me's going to make it any better.
DDM00002287	[The holographic cashier faces you, flickering. It seems to be waiting for you to speak.]
DDM00002288	The cleaners will knock twice. Make sure they're thorough.
DDM00002289	PLAYER THROW GRENADE
DDM00002290	Watch where you're chucking those things!
DDM00002291	[Christine covers her ears.]
DDM00002292	Don't waste those - save one for when they get close.
DDM00002293	Arooooooooo!
DDM00002294	A little party favor before the grand finale.
DDM00002295	[Christine points at mine, then taps her temple.]
DDM00002296	Thinking ahead... good.
DDM00002297	Want Dog to fetch bomb-thing? Or not touch?
DDM00002298	Don't be ridiculous - point that somewhere else, will you?
DDM00002299	[Christine frowns, points at your collar, then hers.]
DDM00002300	I didn't take you for suicidal.
DDM00002301	Don't shoot. Bullets hurt.
DDM00002302	Hello
DDM00002303	Goodbye.
DDM00002304	Come back if you need something.
DDM00002305	...
DDM00002306	[Christine nods.]
DDM00002307	I'd shed a tear, but I'm sure we'll be chatting again.
DDM00002308	That's enough for now.
DDM00002309	I'd shed a tear, but I'm sure we'll be chatting again.
DDM00002310	That's enough for now.
DDM00002311	Attack
DDM00002312	Time to cash this one out.
DDM00002313	Godammit.
DDM00002314	Batting a thousand, that's us.
DDM00002315	Used to open in Paris. Paris. Now this.
DDM00002316	Can't believe I left the apartment for this.
DDM00002317	[Christine narrows her eyes, and her stance changes.]
DDM00002318	Hrrhrhhhhnnnh!
DDM00002319	Something needs to die.
DDM00002320	Ah!
DDM00002321	[Christine takes the blow, doesn't flinch.]
DDM00002322	Hnh!
DDM00002323	Ennh!
DDM00002324	Flee
DDM00002325	Valor, you're up - discretion and me, we're outta here.
DDM00002326	[Christine shakes her head, waves at you to follow.]
DDM00002327	Hnnnh-hnnnh-hnnh.
DDM00002328	Find a defensible position, we'll kill them there.
DDM00002329	Steal
DDM00002330	If you find a place to pawn that, go right ahead.
DDM00002331	Greed took the others - go on, keep it. I'll get it back eventually.
DDM00002332	[Christine narrows her eyes, then shakes her head and waves you off.]
DDM00002333	Hnnnh? Rhnhhhrrrr...
DDM00002334	Take from me again, and I'll leave you for the Sierra Madre.
DDM00002335	Fine, fine - don't want us both blowing up anyway.
DDM00002336	[Christine checks herself, stops attacking, looks angry, points at collar.]
DDM00002337	Hnnnr? Hnnn.
DDM00002338	Next time, I'll break your legs and hang you from the Madre gates.
DDM00002339	Assault
DDM00002340	What're you doing that for? Fine, let's settle this.
DDM00002341	[Christine points at your collar, then hers.]
DDM00002342	Hnnhh? Hrnnnnn.
DDM00002343	If this is how you want to die, then so be it.
DDM00002344	Murder
DDM00002345	Hnnnhhhr!
DDM00002346	Die.
DDM00002347	Let me whip up a special cocktail...
DDM00002348	[Christine waves for you to get back, makes throwing motion.]
DDM00002349	Hnnnh-Hnnnh-Hnnnh.
DDM00002350	Let sound and thunder answer this.
DDM00002351	Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
DDM00002352	[Christine makes frantic motions with her hands.]
DDM00002353	Hhh-hhh-hhhhnnn!
DDM00002354	Look out.
DDM00002355	StartCombat
DDM00002356	Food!
DDM00002357	Dog was getting hungry.
DDM00002358	Kill this one before they call others.
DDM00002359	I'll end you.
DDM00002360	Of course, it was getting too quiet.
DDM00002361	Going to need a hand here, "partner."
DDM00002362	[Christine's eyes narrow, stance changes.]
DDM00002363	Death
DDM00002364	Vera, sweetheart... see you soon.
DDM00002365	Guess a fat lady's singing somewhere.
DDM00002366	You win, Sinclair.
DDM00002367	So much for the Sierra Madre.
DDM00002368	[Christine clutches her collar as she falls, clawing at it.]
DDM00002369	:: Death cry ::
DDM00002370	Finally, the howling will end.
DDM00002371	Arrrrrroooooooooo!
DDM00002372	Rhhhhhhrrrrrrr!
DDM00002373	Let's kill them, Dog.
DDM00002374	Ah, guests. Their mistake.
DDM00002375	Jackpot!
DDM00002376	Just couldn't mind your own business...
DDM00002377	[Christine motions to you, points.]
DDM00002378	Hnh? Smell something.
DDM00002379	Something's moving, moving.
DDM00002380	Trespassers.
DDM00002381	Something's out there.
DDM00002382	Sounds like we got a tourist.
DDM00002383	What was that?
DDM00002384	[Christine holds up her hand, pauses, then starts scanning the area.]
DDM00002385	Enough - the Sierra Madre is our target, not its ghosts.
DDM00002386	Perhaps they ran. If not... we'll see them soon.
DDM00002387	Hnh.
DDM00002388	Sierra Madre's playing tricks with me now.
DDM00002389	Forget this, let's focus on getting into the casino.
DDM00002390	[Christine does one final scan, then shakes her head, and motions forward.]
DDM00002391	Do good? Eat now?
DDM00002392	Hnnnrrh, all done, all gone.
DDM00002393	Finished here.
DDM00002394	That felt... good.
DDM00002395	Nice finish.
DDM00002396	Leave 'em wanting more.
DDM00002397	[Christine scans the area, then relaxes slightly.]
DDM00002398	Where are they? Not done yet.
DDM00002399	Lost them.
DDM00002400	Where did you go?
DDM00002401	No matter where you run, I'll find you.
DDM00002402	Lost, but not forgotten.
DDM00002403	Now where did you go?
DDM00002404	[Christine narrows her eyes, shakes her head.]
DDM00002405	Hnnf.
DDM00002406	Madre's playing tricks on me. Whoever it is, they're gone.
DDM00002407	Guess they skedaddled. Sounds good to me.
DDM00002408	[Christine scans the area, then shakes her head.]
DDM00002409	Nothing.
DDM00002410	Food's back.
DDM00002411	Hunt's on.
DDM00002412	Should've stayed lost.
DDM00002413	Won't get away again.
DDM00002414	Back like a bad habit.
DDM00002415	Thought they'd bailed.
DDM00002416	[Christine's eyes narrow, points.]
DDM00002417	Hnnnrrrrrrrrrrrr.
DDM00002418	Hnnnnrrrrrr...
DDM00002419	Whatever it is, it's still out there. Waiting.
DDM00002420	It'll come to us, Dog. Just wait. We'll kill it together.
DDM00002421	Still out there.
DDM00002422	I can hear you moving, whoever you are.
DDM00002423	[Christine raises her hand, and starts scanning the area.]
DDM00002424	Where is the food?
DDM00002425	Dog hungry, please come out.
DDM00002426	Where are you?
DDM00002427	I'll find you, you can't hide.
DDM00002428	Still looking... although I'm all for following suit and leaving.
DDM00002429	Vanished like a Maxis act.
DDM00002430	[Christine scans the area intently.]

DDM00002450	Spooky Audio!
DDM00002451	Wait here.
DDM00002452	Don't be long.
DDM00002453	[Christine nods.]
DDM00002454	Whatever you're planning, hurry.
DDM00002455	Hrnnh. Dog will wait.
DDM00002456	Let's trade equipment.
DDM00002457	Let's deal.
DDM00002458	[Christine nods, adjusts her gear.]
DDM00002459	All of your weapons will do. And your stims.
DDM00002460	Dog fetches... will share... have food?
DDM00002461	Enough about tactics.
DDM00002462	Fine. "Tactics" means "stay out of sight" around here anyway.
DDM00002463	[Christine nods, waits.]
DDM00002464	Fine. What else?
DDM00002465	Hnnh-nnn. Dog not sure he remember anyway.
DDM00002466	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
DDM00002467	Oh, you bet. I'll flank them... might take me a while, though, so you just hold tight.
DDM00002468	[Christine nods, makes a half circle with her hand.]
DDM00002469	I'll watch over you.
DDM00002470	Hnn.
DDM00002471	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
DDM00002472	Enough gum-flapping, Madre's not getting any younger.
DDM00002473	[Christine nods.]
DDM00002474	If you mean into the casino, then - yes.
DDM00002475	Hnhhr!
DDM00002476	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
DDM00002477	All right.
DDM00002478	[Christine nods.]
DDM00002479	Go on - but keep it quick.
DDM00002480	Hnnh-hnnn.
DDM00002481	Stay close to me.
DDM00002482	Like dancing with your shadow.
DDM00002483	[Christine nods.]
DDM00002484	If you're sure.
DDM00002485	Hrnnnh, Dog will be kin. Like others in night.
DDM00002486	Stick close to me.
DDM00002487	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
DDM00002488	You're the one who dragged me out of my apartment, so yeah, I'm keeping close. So what?
DDM00002489	[Christine tilts her head slightly.]
DDM00002490	What is it? It won't matter in the end.
DDM00002491	Hnnh?
DDM00002492	I want you to use ranged weapons.
DDM00002493	I'll be sure to cover you, don't you worry.
DDM00002494	[Christine nods, closes one eye and slowly pulls an invisible trigger.]
DDM00002495	While I'm in control, my ability to use his hands is... difficult.
DDM00002496	Dog will try... trigger and sight... Dog prefer to hit with bear trap.
DDM00002497	Switch to a melee weapon.
DDM00002498	Boxing's not really my thing. I prefer the gentle touch... but all right, it's your show.
DDM00002499	[Christine nods, and her stance changes slightly.]
DDM00002500	To warn you, as long as I'm in control, my coordination... suffers.
DDM00002501	Dog good at smashing things that move with bear trap.
DDM00002502	Let's talk about something else.
DDM00002503	Sure, let's jaw all day and all night, why not?
DDM00002504	[Christine frowns, taps the back of her wrist, then circles her finger.]
DDM00002505	And what do you want to discuss now?
DDM00002506	Hnnnh... Dog is listening.
DDM00002507	That's all. Let's get going.
DDM00002508	If that's all, let's shake a leg.
DDM00002509	[Christine nods.]
DDM00002510	Good... you were starting to bore me.
DDM00002511	Dog hears you, will follow.
DDM00002512	I want you to change your combat style.
DDM00002513	Style's not something you just change, friend.
DDM00002514	[Christine looks at you and waits.]
DDM00002515	As long as I am in control, fighting... is difficult. I'm not the... beast he is.
DDM00002516	Hrnnnh? What do you want?
DDM00002517	Let's talk about your tactics.
DDM00002518	Tactics? What, we going to get into a shootout soon, or...?
DDM00002519	[Christine raises an eyebrow suspiciously.]
DDM00002520	Tactics? Why don't you let me worry about that - you just follow along, I'll take care of you.
DDM00002521	Hnnrrh? What do you want Dog to do?
DDM00002522	Let's get going.
DDM00002523	Music to my ears.
DDM00002524	[Christine nods.]
DDM00002525	Good. I was growing... impatient.
DDM00002526	Rhhhr. Dog will follow.
DDM00002527	It's time for us to part ways.
DDM00002528	You sure? I mean... look, you can't just tell me to walk now, you know. That's... well, not very friendly.
DDM00002529	[Christine raises an eyebrow.]
DDM00002530	You... want us to split up. All... three of us?
DDM00002531	Why you send Dog away? Dog hear you right?
DDM00002532	I think we should travel together.
DDM00002533	Lose the second-stringer, and I'll make the time.
DDM00002534	Strike up the band, Domino's back in town.
DDM00002535	[Christine glances at your companion, shakes her head, then raises her index finger.]
DDM00002536	[Christine nods.]
DDM00002537	I'll only travel with you... get rid of the other piece of meat, then we'll talk.
DDM00002538	I'll follow you. For now.
DDM00002539	Nnnn-Nnn... too many, Dog waits until you lose one... maybe let Dog feed?
DDM00002540	Dog is ready. Where we go?
DDM00002541	Arrrooooooooooohnhrhnhr.
DDM00002542	So hungry.
DDM00002543	Time to feed.
DDM00002544	So be it.
DDM00002545	Don't have time for this.
DDM00002546	Just wanted a little peace and quiet.
DDM00002547	Time to make some music.
DDM00002548	Strike up the band.
DDM00002549	Great.
DDM00002550	[Christine's eyes narrow, stance changes.]
DDM00002551	On second thought, stick with me for a little longer.
DDM00002552	That's a relief. I-I mean, not like I care. I'm fine on my own.
DDM00002553	[Christine narrows her eyes, then shrugs.]
DDM00002554	Make up your mind.
DDM00002555	Dog stays.
DDM00002556	Yes, I'm sure.
DDM00002557	I can't say it hasn't been fun... well, I can, but I'll save it for my memoirs.
DDM00002558	[Christine nods.]
DDM00002559	I'll make more progress on my own - just don't get us killed.
DDM00002560	Dog will leave.
DDM00002561	I hear you.
DDM00002562	[Christine nods.]
DDM00002563	Very well.
DDM00002564	Hhh-hhnn. Dog hears you.
DDM00002565	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
DDM00002566	All you, trust me.
DDM00002567	[Christine raises an eyebrow, then shrugs.]
DDM00002568	As long as you don't get yourself killed.
DDM00002569	Only if save pieces for Dog...
DDM00002570	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
DDM00002571	Yeah, right. Oh, you're serious. You bet.
DDM00002572	[Christine narrows her eyes, nods.]
DDM00002573	Of course... murder's in our blood.
DDM00002574	Hrrrrrrrrrrr... Dog will do that.
DDM00002575	Who was this Father Elijah to you?
DDM00002576	I would say he was my tutor, but that doesn't cover it.
DDM00002577	After my parents passed, he looked after me. The whole Brotherhood brought me up, really, but he made sure of it.
DDM00002578	I never had a grandfather - not that I knew, anyway - but Elijah was in some ways what I'd imagine a grandfather to be.
DDM00002579	Where is he now?
DDM00002580	I don't know. Last time anyone saw him was in the battle at HELIOS One. I wasn't there.
DDM00002581	He gave orders to hold the plant until it could be reactivated. But he ran out of time. The NCR overran it. Everyone thought he was dead.
DDM00002582	But I got a note from him at a comm station. That's... how he liked to talk, even to me. He wasn't good at face-to-face.
DDM00002583	I'm bleeding green here, any ideas?
DDM00002584	[Christine winces, clutches her side.]
DDM00002585	Hnnnhrrrrrhn.
DDM00002586	Head swimming. Can't hold myself... together much longer.
DDM00002587	Uh... could use a little boost here.
DDM00002588	Great, spilling my guts out to everybody.
DDM00002589	[Christine winces, then tries to hide it.]
DDM00002590	Hrrrrrrn.
DDM00002591	Losing blood.
DDM00002592	Wake
DDM00002593	Don't want to repeat that number.
DDM00002594	Feels like someone played my head like a trombone.
DDM00002595	[Christine shakes her head, gets quickly back on her feet.]
DDM00002596	[Christine quickly leaps to her feet, narrows her eyes, and scans the area.]
DDM00002597	Nnnnnn... eyes went black.
DDM00002598	Good thing Dog wake up and not other voice.
DDM00002599	At least I woke up instead of remaining in the dark.
DDM00002600	Whatever it is, I want to kill it.
DDM00002601	They're cutting through this like paper!
DDM00002602	[Christine quickly taps what she's wearing, makes a hatchet motion.]
DDM00002603	Song and dance might work better than what I've got.
DDM00002604	[Christine taps her weapon angrily, assumes defensive stance.]
DDM00002605	Hrhhhnnnhh!
DDM00002606	Can't hurt this one, give me something that will.
DDM00002607	Bullets all cashed out here!
DDM00002608	[Christine taps her gun in frustration.]
DDM00002609	Hnnnrh?
DDM00002610	Too many targets, not enough bullets.
DDM00002611	Yeah... that's the sweet stuff.
DDM00002612	[Christine checks herself, gives the thumbs up.]
DDM00002613	Hnh. Better.
DDM00002614	Physician, heal thyself.
DDM00002615	Crippled
DDM00002616	Can finally park in handicapped spaces now.
DDM00002617	[Christine taps herself, then waves her hand - she looks in pain.]
DDM00002618	Hhrrnnnnnhhh!
DDM00002619	Dog's damaged.
DDM00002620	Unff!
DDM00002621	[Christine's eyes blank, and she falls.]
DDM00002622	Hnnh.
DDM00002623	Rrr!
DDM00002624	Nnnf!
DDM00002625	Hnnhr!
DDM00002626	Hnnhr!
DDM00002627	Regenerating
DDM00002628	Feeling the music.
DDM00002629	Spring's back in my step.
DDM00002630	[Christine blinks, takes a breath, then nods.]
DDM00002631	Pain's going away.
DDM00002632	Finally - pain's gone, can focus.
DDM00002633	Ah! Get a rug, put me out, something!
DDM00002634	[Christine begins to beat at the flames on her body.]
DDM00002635	Hrnnnnooooo!
DDM00002636	Fire.
DDM00002637	Frenzy
DDM00002638	Let's bring down the house!
DDM00002639	[Christine's face peels back in a snarl.]
DDM00002640	Rhhhharrrhhh!
DDM00002641	That's done it.
DDM00002642	Poison
DDM00002643	I can help you in the Cloud, not for long, though.
DDM00002644	Don't dive in for too long, only so much I can do to help.
DDM00002645	[Christine looks at you, touches her throat, frowns.]
DDM00002646	Hnnhrr... air smells bad.
DDM00002647	Eyes stinging.
DDM00002648	Won't get rid of me that easily.
DDM00002649	Trying to lose me in the Cloud? Not a chance.
DDM00002650	Get a porter, carrying someone's bags - not my style.
DDM00002651	[Christine puts her palm flat and lowers it to the ground, shakes her head.]
DDM00002652	Allying with you is already more of a burden than I can bear.
DDM00002653	Hnnh-Nnn. Dog can't carry any more.
DDM00002654	This crouching's hell on my knees.
DDM00002655	[Christine crouches down.]
DDM00002656	Wish I had a Stealth Boy instead of this bear trap.
DDM00002657	Right behind you.
DDM00002658	Hnnnn. Dog is following.
DDM00002659	No have wrist-collar now - Dog still good at not be seen.
DDM00002660	How Dog hunted back West. For Lou.
DDM00002661	It's better you don't. Let me hold onto it.
DDM00002662	Fine. I guess it doesn't matter anyway, keep it. I won't ask again.
DDM00002663	Would you mind if I looked at the message?
DDM00002664	Just mad ramblings. He didn't make much sense.
DDM00002665	Oh god. He... I guess he was lost a long time ago. Even at the end...
DDM00002666	Still... thanks for bringing word. At least, now I know.
DDM00002667	He explained the search for the Sierra Madre... healed him.
DDM00002668	Hmm. Unlikely. He was a little too focused on gears and diodes... tech was the cure-all.
DDM00002669	Can you unlock it for me first? He was... vague on that point.
DDM00002670	Yeah. Yeah. Thought as much. He'd been fading away for a long time.
DDM00002671	Some last words - a message. Nothing important.
DDM00002672	What was on it? What did he say?
DDM00002673	Sorry... feel a little out of it. Head's spinning a bit...
DDM00002674	Oh. Oh!
DDM00002675	I think he left me a gift. Maybe I can use it better than he did.
DDM00002676	What did he say to you?
DDM00002677	The parts I understood? Didn't matter. Past all the garbage, all it amounted to was goodbye.
DDM00002678	That was... that was hard to watch.
DDM00002679	You should watch it.
DDM00002680	All right, I'll watch it.
DDM00002681	You should listen to this.
DDM00002682	He left this holo-message. Here.
DDM00002683	Where did you get this?
DDM00002684	Guess I was right about the bad news, huh? Same look Elder McNamara always gave me when I was up for promotion.
DDM00002685	Did he say anything when you met him? Anything...anything at all?
DDM00002686	...it doesn't matter. He died when we all retreated to Hidden Valley. I didn't expect to see him again, no one did.
DDM00002687	I had to trap him inside a Pre-War... prison.
DDM00002688	Trapped him? Where?
DDM00002689	I had to kill him.
DDM00002690	You killed him? But...
DDM00002691	I found Elijah.
DDM00002692	You did? Where? Oh my God, I mean... I thought... I don't even know what I thought might have happened to him.
DDM00002693	But... you don't have a "this is good news" expression on your face.
DDM00002694	Meet me at the Fountain, then we'll go from there.
DDM00002695	All right, come with me.
DDM00002696	[Christine nods, and steps slightly behind you, waiting.]
DDM00002697	Just die, tired of listening to you anyway.
DDM00002698	Silence suits me fine. When your master shows, I'll deal with him, too.
DDM00002699	Just glad you're safe. Hold up here, I'll take care of Elijah.
DDM00002700	Good luck. He's... not an easy opponent. If I can, I'll help. Might be able to figure something out using the Sierra Madre's computer systems.
DDM00002701	What do you want to say?
DDM00002702	I've been hunting the one who hijacked your Pip-Boy, Elijah, for... some time.
DDM00002703	He cannot leave the Sierra Madre alive. What he's done... what he's done here is nothing compared to what he's done in the past.
DDM00002704	The only way to bring him out is if you get to the vault... he won't allow you to go down there alone. That's when we kill him.
DDM00002705	You could have said something sooner.
DDM00002706	Wasn't sure until now I could trust you. Now I know.
DDM00002707	Look, when I woke up here... however that happened... I had this key on me - I think it belongs to her.
DDM00002708	Haven't had a chance to use it yet - might open the dresser, or the safe - didn't have time to experiment with it before you arrived. Here you go.
DDM00002709	Wasn't sure until now I could trust you. Now I know.
DDM00002710	I know Elijah needs to be dealt with, just let me handle it.
DDM00002711	When Dog fell in the Sierra Madre casino, two died as one.
DDM00002712	Dog died hungry, alone, frightened.
DDM00002713	The voice in his head died with him. Screaming. Furious. Enraged.
DDM00002714	But the voice was gone, and Dog was grateful.
DDM00002715	At least Dog was dead and the voice needed to watch over him no more.
DDM00002716	In the moment before their lives ended, the wall between the two personalities fell. The two became silent as they saw the chain between them.
DDM00002717	Hunger and control are twin greeds, something Dog and his shadow had never realized.
DDM00002718	Dog forgot himself, as did the voice that raged within him. After their passing, a new voice spoke within the mutant's shell.
DDM00002719	It was difficult for the voice to remember the two it once was... there was the beast, Dog consumed by hunger...
DDM00002720	...and the other in reverse... the one consumed by control.
DDM00002721	Both were driven by need for the other. The Courier brought them together, somehow, joined the two into one.
DDM00002722	All that happened at the Sierra Madre, was a faint memory to the new personality... like a flickering light in the clouds of the mind.
DDM00002723	The new voice did not think of the Courier again until the battle at the Divide reached his ears.
DDM00002724	The battle between the two couriers, beneath the torn skies and the Old World flag... each bearing a message for the other.
DDM00002725	And the mutant prayed the Courier that had saved him... had been saved in return.
DDM00002726	Dog, free of the voice inside his head and no longer waiting on the voice of the Master, wandered back West.
DDM00002727	His hunger never ended. Often, small communities would suddenly vanish.
DDM00002728	They were assumed to have been hit by Wasteland creatures and dragged away... dogs, Brahmin, and humans alike.
DDM00002729	Freed of both Dog and the one who held Dog's leash, the other voice resumed control. First the mind, then finally, the mutant's shell.
DDM00002730	His first act was to tend to the scars on the body with careful hands, slowly healing all the scars except the ragged name torn on his chest.
DDM00002731	He briefly thought of remaining at the Sierra Madre. But it was a monument built by humans, representing something he no longer needed.
DDM00002732	He began walking west, in search of others like him. As he did, he spoke of the courier who had set him free and allowed his life to begin again.
DDM00002733	Christine, scarred by her hunt for Elijah and unable to let him go, perished in the Sierra Madre Casino.
DDM00002734	She never completed her mission, nor did she stop to consider what had driven her to accept the mission in the first place.
DDM00002735	Obsession is another form of greed, a lesson that Christine never learned.
DDM00002736	Christine, her mission complete, found new purpose as the Sierra Madre's warden. She watched over it silently - by choice.
DDM00002737	Over time, the Ghost People came to see her as one of the Holograms. They would watch, silently, as she walked among them.
DDM00002738	At times, Christine thought of the Courier, who had kept Elijah's hand from her throat.
DDM00002739	The Courier reminded her of the other courier she had met in the Big Empty, and wondered if the two had found each other at last.
DDM00002740	She did not think of them again until she heard the legends of the Divide.
DDM00002741	The Divide, where the two messengers, the two couriers, fought beneath an ancient flag, at the edge of the world.
DDM00002742	Dean Domino, entertainer, singer... thief... had his last show on the Sierra Madre stage.
DDM00002743	The heist he spent over two hundred years planning fell apart, just as the first, by underestimating his partner's strength.
DDM00002744	Not long after the Courier left the Villa, the lights in the theater shut off, one by one.
DDM00002745	Only Dean's Hologram remained on stage, singing silently to an empty room.
DDM00002746	Still... as consumed as he had been with its riches and ruin, the Sierra Madre had held him captive long ago.
DDM00002747	Dean Domino, entertainer, singer... thief... explored the Sierra Madre not long after he was rescued by the Courier.
DDM00002748	Once he left the theater, the Sierra Madre recognized him as a guest, and many doors opened to him. He had to admit, it had been built to last.
DDM00002749	During his search, he came across the final records of Vera and Sinclair, and realized what happened the night the bombs fell.
DDM00002750	He felt strangely sad for a moment, and he had no idea why.
DDM00002751	Shrugging it off, his mind turned instead to where the Courier had come from. Vegas still survived, out there in the Mojave.
DDM00002752	Its sights, sounds... and casinos, ripe for the taking.
DDM00002753	So giving the Sierra Madre one last nod and a wink, he set off beyond the Cloud to begin again.
DDM00002754	<Lie> We'll take the elevator up, see if there's another way to do this. After you.
DDM00002755	[Christine smiles slightly in relief, and moves to the elevator.]
DDM00002756	All right, let me see if I can find another way to do this without sending you down there.
DDM00002757	[Christine smiles slightly in relief, and nods. She opens her mouth slightly, then closes it, frustrated.]
DDM00002758	[She points at you, then makes a fist and puts it against her chest and nods.]
DDM00002759	I need you to go down to the manual bypass room to regulate the power.
DDM00002760	[Christine glances at the elevator, her expression becomes worried, then she looks back at you, then reluctantly shakes her head.]
DDM00002761	I need you to stay here and fire off the Gala Event.
DDM00002762	Unless you get some Hologram guards lit up in the courtyard below? No dice.
DDM00002763	Whoa, whoa, whoa... in the middle of town here? Alone? On a rooftop, with a big lightshow in the air?
DDM00002764	Tell you what - why don't you just find one of those Cosmic steak knives so I can slit my wrists, be less painful checking out that way.
DDM00002765	I'd like help with something else.
DDM00002766	[The Hologram waits.]
DDM00002767	20 Chips for 20 Pre-War Bills.
DDM00002768	[You count out the bills on the counter. A panel flips, followed by slow, steady series of clicks, and a stack of chips rise up from the panel.]
DDM00002769	Let me have 5 Chips for 5 Pre-War Bills.
DDM00002770	[You set the bills on the counter. A panel flips, there is a single whir, a click, then a panel rises up with a handful of Sierra Madre Chips.]
DDM00002771	Uh... 1 Chip for 1 Pre-War Bill.
DDM00002772	[You place the bill on the counter. A panel rotates, and the bill is replaced with a single Sierra Madre Chip.]
DDM00002773	That's all for now. Thanks.
DDM00002774	[The Hologram nods, gives a stiff farewell wave.]
DDM00002775	Can I turn in my Sierra Madre Chips for Pre-War Money?
DDM00002776	[The Hologram points at the table before you. As you set the chips down, the tabletop rotates, and with a whir, Pre-War bills slide out.]
DDM00002777	I want to exchange Pre-War money for some Sierra Madre Chips.
DDM00002778	[The Hologram makes a gesture, seems to be indicating amounts and figures.]
DDM00002779	Are you all right?
DDM00002780	Yeah, now. Talk about a captive audience. Or captive entertainer? Eh - whatever.
DDM00002781	What did you just do... can't access the protocols. Didn't even think Elijah could break Madre security... hnh. Must be a Scribe, too.
DDM00002782	Security's down...? Hnh. Doesn't matter, won't help you.
DDM00002783	If it's who I think it is, this is Christine... recovered. In what looks like an Old World hotel room, high class, two rooms - exit's sealed.
DDM00002784	Floor's got holographic security. Not latest tech, field of view targeting systems, primitive. Familiar.
DDM00002785	Floor looks like it protected the guests too well. Checked the Suite, found the holographic woman from the Villa Fountain.
DDM00002786	Picking up that interference frequency, same as the Villa, floor's live with speakers and radios. Keep an ear out, watch the walls.
DDM00002787	Doors on this floor are all operated manually in an emergency, place is locked up tight. Must be keycards around somewhere.
DDM00002788	Looks like security systems did more to kill the people here than the Bomb did. Hope there's a way out of this casino.
DDM00002789	What's with my collar... Elijah? Or... no, it's you. Even better. This is Christine, voice back. You got off on the wrong floor, you're trapped.
DDM00002790	Hope you can make it past security. I've been looking forward to taking care of you since the Gala Event.
DDM00002791	You and Elijah were working together this whole time. Should've known, just from your actions, you have his... outlook on things.
DDM00002792	Hope you aren't dead yet... although I'm sure my collar would let me know. I could just detonate it now, but saving it for someone special.
DDM00002793	Did you really think you could steal from me? The Sierra Madre is mine.
DDM00002794	You think you've outsmarted me? You can't get away. You're the one on a leash, you always were.
DDM00002795	You think you've escaped... no. No, you were never out of reach... my hand was always around your neck.
DDM00002796	This entire structure is mine to command. Security... weapons... all this technology - mine. Now - you die.
DDM00002797	Alarms... what... you. Think you can run, think you can trick me?
DDM00002798	Eh? What's this.
DDM00002799	Think you've won? You've won nothing.
DDM00002800	You came all this way... but you lost as soon as you arrived here.
DDM00002801	I'm not without weapons of my own... let me show you.
DDM00002802	Struggle all you want... the Sierra Madre will be your grave.
DDM00002803	Time is against you. It always was.
DDM00002804	Aaah... Pre-War junk. I'll put you down myself.
DDM00002805	Don't have time for this.
DDM00002806	Pre-War tech... so easy to control, just like your Pip-Boy. Turrets, Holograms, they're all just toys.
DDM00002807	I'll have the Sierra Madre kill you for me. You can't beat all the casino's defenses... it's only a matter of time now.
DDM00002808	Staying in the Vault? Think it'll protect you? No... I don't think so.
DDM00002809	Unlock it, give it back, then shut up.
DDM00002810	Yes. It was entrusted to me, not you.
DDM00002811	Here you go.
DDM00002812	Did it make any sense?
DDM00002813	It's a message. The news is up to you.
DDM00002814	There's something I wanted to pass along.
DDM00002815	He's dead.
DDM00002816	He's trapped, no chance of him escaping.
DDM00002817	I had to kill him before he hurt others.
DDM00002818	Get away while you can, before he comes back.
DDM00002819	Makes Dog hurt self.
DDM00002820	Master, help me, Master, help me. Please.
DDM00002821	Don't let him make me hurt myself. Hurt keeps him away.
DDM00002822	So hungry.
DDM00002823	I'll be good this time, I promise, Master, just keep him away.
DDM00002824	Noise makes my stomach hurt.
DDM00002825	Turn the noise off.
DDM00002826	Puts Dog in the cage, hiding downstairs.
DDM00002827	He's watching, waiting for you to try and let me go.
DDM00002828	So hungry.
DDM00002829	Dog, back in the cage.
DDM00002830	What have we here? You weren't who I was expecting. I'm disappointed.
DDM00002831	Still... even if you aren't my intended guest, you take direction. Good. You can't have been an idiot to figure out how to release me from my cage...
DDM00002832	...or perhaps you are, with that leash on your arm and the one around your neck... with our collars and manacles, why, we may as well be kin.
DDM00002833	Knew you would come, below the cage... down to where I am. Maybe you saw the letters I scratched on the Villa walls.
DDM00002834	A little farther. Follow my voice... that's it. The one in the cage? Dog. I had to lock him up. He keeps... disobeying me.
DDM00002835	That's me, there, on the table. The disk. My voice.
DDM00002836	Can't take any chances, though... you may be some victim who simply stumbled down here. If so, can't let you let Dog out... no, not yet.
DDM00002837	If you're who I think you are, you came to fetch Dog, use him to drag others here. Now I'll use you - and that Pip-Boy you're wearing.
DDM00002838	You're smart. Clever. The key to Dog's cage is simple. Take my voice to the cage above. Let me speak to the beast inside.
DDM00002839	Then you and I... we can talk.
DDM00002840	I don't have time for this. Get in the damn elevator.
DDM00002841	[Christine shakes her head, more insistently this time. She points at the elevator, then downwards, then holds herself tightly and shakes her head.]
DDM00002842	I've found a way to do the bypass from here. You should be able to just use the terminal over there.
DDM00002843	[Christine nods gratefully. She glances in the direction of the terminal, looks at you, smiles, gives a thumbs up.]
DDM00002844	[Christine motions to you, points at the door uneasily, then makes a pulling motion with her hand. She seems hesitant to go near it.]
DDM00002845	Well, if I can get here, others will be, soon enough. Fountain's the safest place.
DDM00002846	That's... a good point. All right, let me grab some smokes, and I'll meet you at the Fountain.
DDM00002847	Fine. Get up and follow me.
DDM00002848	All right... partner.
DDM00002849	All right, all right... but you already got company, so tell you what - I'll meet you at the Fountain.
DDM00002850	Any reason you can't find your way there?
DDM00002851	I know what's out there. It's why I've planted a mine field, shotguns, and explosives all the way on the road to my little boudoir here.
DDM00002852	So we go together, or we're not going at all. I'll split my hand in Blackjack when the time's right, I'm not splitting up in this town, trust me.
DDM00002853	We'll find out more about our "contract" back at the Fountain.
DDM00002854	Fine. Get up and follow me.
DDM00002855	I think you can manage walking there without me. Now get going.
DDM00002856	Wait, wait... wait just a minute. I'm not walking out there on my own.
DDM00002857	Meet at the Fountain, and we'll hear what the next step is.
DDM00002858	Not leaving me much choice. The Fountain, huh? Hope the Hologram's still working and the battery's running strong.
DDM00002859	I'll follow you, I'm not going alone, trust me. Not like I'm a coward or anything, I'm not running around town without an escort.
DDM00002860	I'm serious. One of the locals catches us, we aren't coming back - and I'd like to keep an eye on you.
DDM00002861	It's starting to make sense, now that I've met you.
DDM00002862	All right, all right... looks like marriage finally caught me.
DDM00002863	I'm listening... partner. What's next, if we're death-til-we-part?
DDM00002864	I only need you breathing. Push me, I'll bring you to the point of death, then leave you.
DDM00002865	Agree to come with me now, or I get up from this chair and kill us both, shaped-charge or no.
DDM00002866	Forget this, I'm leaving.
DDM00002867	Either deal with me as an equal, or I walk.
DDM00002868	Just like all the rest. Strolling in here, thinking you own the place. I've been here longer than any of you tourists.
DDM00002869	Trust me, I'm letting you off easier than the Sierra Madre ever would. Nobody's going to miss you... whoever you are, you're old news.
DDM00002870	I think you're bluffing. I'm getting up, right now.
DDM00002871	Uh... look, maybe we can make some sort of... deal, you and me.
DDM00002872	[SUCCEEDED] What are you talking about?
DDM00002873	Your negotiation skills assume you're bargaining from a position of strength.
DDM00002874	[FAILED] The hand's been dealt, that's the deal. You going along with my terms, or do you want your brains to be wallpaper?
DDM00002875	Our collars... these "neckties" are linked. I die, you die.
DDM00002876	That's an interesting clause. That's a real bad contract you have. We have.
DDM00002877	I'm not going to help you.
DDM00002878	That so?
DDM00002879	I'll cooperate. What do you want?
DDM00002880	Good, good - then we're in business. I may be a betting man, but I like it when the odds are in our favor.
DDM00002881	If you're here with who I think, then I'd rather have you on my side than his. An... ace in the hole.
DDM00002882	You want to live, I want what's in the Madre. Real simple.
DDM00002883	Misund...? Ummm.
DDM00002884	Christ, if that collar blows, I don't know if you'd know the difference, you'd probably still keep walking around with that dumb, blank look.
DDM00002885	Just because I work in entertainment, doesn't mean I'm a moron.
DDM00002886	I'm listening.
DDM00002887	You've got my attention. For the moment.
DDM00002888	Look - I need your help to get into the Sierra Madre.
DDM00002889	Oh, of course you do. Now, it's like we're married with these big wedding rings around our necks.
DDM00002890	So why don't you hear my proposal first, before you start talking about what you need.
DDM00002891	Uh... you... probably want to hear my side of things.
DDM00002892	[SUCCEEDED] And that's what I've missed - a rapt audience.
DDM00002893	I'll save my questions for the end - please, go on.
DDM00002894	[FAILED] You don't listen too good, do you? Makes me think whatever you have to say isn't worth my time.
DDM00002895	Get up without my permission, I'll blast your ass so far through your head, it'll turn the moon cherry pie red.
DDM00002896	So - let's keep this sweet and polite, and finish our conversation with no misunderstandings.
DDM00002897	Just because I work in entertainment, doesn't mean I'm a moron.
DDM00002898	I heard my necktie beeping, I know what that means - I'm part of this somehow. I want out of this contract.
DDM00002899	And if you put me in it, I'm not going to be too happy. So whatever's going on here, if you're part of all this? You're taking orders from me.
DDM00002900	I'm not an idiot. I know the reason I'm in here now is because of the old guy - and you.
DDM00002901	And you're wearing a collar, so I trust you a little more than the old guy. He's more controlling than I'd like.
DDM00002902	Thing is, here's where being my partner pays off. See, I know how to get into the casino vault.
DDM00002903	So here's the short of it - piece together Little Miss Vera Keyes' song in the right order? Sierra Madre opens its legs, we're in business.
DDM00002904	Hnh?
DDM00002905	Great, a moron - just what I need. Look? That seat you're sitting in? It's a bomb. Go boom.
DDM00002906	The chair's... an explosive? But...
DDM00002907	[SUCCEEDED] Sounds like you've done some blue collar construction work in your life, your Ma must be proud. Still...
DDM00002908	Better be a shaped charge, or you're going to kill both of us.
DDM00002909	[FAILED] "Butt" is right. That heart-shaped charge in the stuffing will cause just the right amount of bleeding.
DDM00002910	Not one for sitting when the clock's ticking.
DDM00002911	What are you talking about?
DDM00002912	Might be a bit rude, but that chair you're sitting in - it's got a shaped charge in the seat cushion.
DDM00002913	What can you tell me about the Villa and the town?
DDM00002914	Residential area, clinic, police station - should keep away from the police station, it's a Ghost People hangout.
DDM00002915	Salida del Sol, Puesta del Sol are East Town, West Town. "Sunrise" and "Sunset." Or were when the streets and sky weren't covered with toxic gas.
DDM00002916	Ghost People don't come into the Villa much. West Town and East Town, though... they're thick with the Cloud and Ghost People. Like hunting grounds.
DDM00002917	Tell me about the Cloud.
DDM00002918	The Cloud? Showed up after the Bomb. I think. I got used to it in small doses. Now, it covers the city.
DDM00002919	Over the years, it kept climbing up out of the Sierra Madre, until it was curtains for the sun. Didn't see the sky again.
DDM00002920	Doesn't seem to bother the Ghost People. Can't see through it too well, though, so sometimes I can use the Cloud for cover... if I get desperate.
DDM00002921	Where can I find these cards?
DDM00002922	Around. Don't have much use for them myself, not worth the risk to get them.
DDM00002923	I got all the basics covered, as long as I have the chips to pay for them. I don't need much.
DDM00002924	What other items can you get out of the machines?
DDM00002925	If it's an emergency, you can get chems for any... uh... condition. Sinclair left that for doctors and trained professionals, not the common folk.
DDM00002926	Even security and maintenance could get special supplies out of them. Staff had codes on little cards they could use to unlock them.
DDM00002927	How did he describe it?
DDM00002928	Called it "self-sufficient." Like he was doing the residents a favor. Right.
DDM00002929	Grifters?
DDM00002930	Sinclair made sure if you spent money here, it went one direction - although that's not how he described it.
DDM00002931	I've never seen machines like those before.
DDM00002932	Yeah, well, machines like those weren't unusual before the Bomb. Maybe to you, they're amazing, to me, they're grifters without the personality.
DDM00002933	What are the Vending Machines all over town?
DDM00002934	Those little company stores? Sinclair's toy boxes, put in a casino chip, get a treat, like you're some dog doing tricks.
DDM00002935	Take any of the casino chips, put 'em into the machine, and you'll get something out - a snack, a cola, something to mend a tear in your shirt.
DDM00002936	Sometimes you have to know exactly what to ask for, other times, there's codes for... eh, unconventional items. For emergencies.
DDM00002937	Is there anything else about them I should know?
DDM00002938	Whatever we do - don't rile them up. Normally, there's only a few, maybe a pack. There's more out there, a lot more.
DDM00002939	If they find out someone's trespassing, it'd be shaking a hornet's nest. Don't want to think how many of them could fill these streets.
DDM00002940	I had other questions.
DDM00002941	Of course you do. Let's hear 'em.
DDM00002942	It's your time, and if you want to spend it chatting, not much I can do about it.
DDM00002943	I had questions I wanted to ask.
DDM00002944	All right, keep it short, we don't have a lot of time.
DDM00002945	Focus?
DDM00002946	Always had the Sierra Madre to keep my mind occupied.
DDM00002947	Most folks, they don't have the same drive, the same need. Not worth my time. Pretty much Ghost People before the Bomb, now Ghost People after.
DDM00002948	Where did they come from?
DDM00002949	Friend... "there's more mysteries in heaven and earth..." wait, no, "there is more between heaven and earth..." oh, forget it.
DDM00002950	I'd sooner ask what makes me an undying son of a bitch than spend any thought as to why they crawled to life here.
DDM00002951	I'm counting myself lucky I still have my faculties - they sure don't. Then again, they may not have had the... focus I do.
DDM00002952	I'm not a bad shot. I could probably kill one.
DDM00002953	[SUCCEEDED] Well... you seem like you know how to handle yourself. All right.
DDM00002954	Once, I fired a lucky shot, hit a gas tank one was holding. Blew his arm off at the shoulder... and he didn't get back up after that.
DDM00002955	So if you're that good, don't aim for the head - aim for their bombs. And if you can wait until his buddies are close by, even better.
DDM00002956	I'm a fair shot. One shot, one kill is how I handle problems.
DDM00002957	[FAILED] Yeah, well, "probably" is something a gambler says, not a survivor. I'd keep your pistol where it belongs - in the holster.
DDM00002958	How tough are they?
DDM00002959	You shoot them, they get back up. You stab them, they get back up.
DDM00002960	That's why I have explosives all over this place - unless you blow them up, chop them up, disintegrate 'em, the Ghost People don't go down.
DDM00002961	Not enough bullets in the town to spend on them. So unless you're a real good shot, save one for yourself right before they catch you.
DDM00002962	Have you tried to deal with them?
DDM00002963	Tried talking to them, bribing them, leaving food - nothing. In the years since, they haven't changed their approach, but I sure have.
DDM00002964	They catch you, they drag you into the Cloud, and you're not coming back out. After that, having your necktie go off would be mercy.
DDM00002965	My advice? Stay out of their way, they don't die easy.
DDM00002966	Is anyone else alive around here?
DDM00002967	"Alive's" a tricky word. The locals, the Ghost People? Not sure it applies to them.
DDM00002968	They're a little... uncivilized. They don't talk much. As in, at all.
DDM00002969	Have other people shown up in search of the Sierra Madre?
DDM00002970	Tourists, you bet. They don't stay long... and they don't stay alive long.
DDM00002971	If they survive the Cloud, the Ghost People, the traps, then greed takes over, and they start sizing each other up for funeral suits.
DDM00002972	You're coming with me, or else.
DDM00002973	That's not going to work for me.
DDM00002974	Look, together we can get out of this.
DDM00002975	[She shakes her head - once, then crosses her arms.]
DDM00002976	If your collar goes off, mine goes off, it's better if we guard each other.
DDM00002977	We need to cooperate if we're going to get out of here.
DDM00002978	What do you mean by that?
DDM00002979	[She shakes her head again and draws a line in the air between the two of you.]
DDM00002980	Look, we can have this not-talk later, let's go.
DDM00002981	Enough of this shit, we need to move.
DDM00002982	Let's just say we're in this together.
DDM00002983	[She frowns, narrows her eyes, then slowly shakes her head.]
DDM00002984	Unless you want to lose your head, stop.
DDM00002985	It's a bomb collar - mess with it, it'll go off.
DDM00002986	Don't do that!
DDM00002987	[She looks surprised. Then notices your collar, and raises an eyebrow.]
DDM00002988	If you attack me, you'll regret it.
DDM00002989	What's the matter?
DDM00002990	This isn't what it looks like.
DDM00002991	[The woman opens her mouth again, winces, then frowns and drags a finger across her throat in a slow motion. She looks more angry than pained now.]
DDM00002992	[Frowning, she touches her throat again, gently, then her hand brushes her collar, then her frown deepens.]
DDM00002993	[Her eyes narrow as she traces the edge of the collar until she finds the lock. She begins to press it with her fingers.]
DDM00002994	What happened?
DDM00002995	Look, I'm here to help.
DDM00002996	[She looks shaken. As she glances at the Auto-Doc, she recoils, and her mouth opens - but again, nothing comes out.]
DDM00002997	[She looks back at you, and her hands clench into fists - her eyes narrow, and she takes a step back, studying you.]
DDM00002998	Did somebody cut your vocal cords?
DDM00002999	Looks like someone carved a roadmap across your face.
DDM00003000	Who are you?
DDM00003001	Are you all right?
DDM00003002	[She looks at you, blinks again, then opens her mouth - but nothing comes out.]
DDM00003003	[She touches her throat, then traces the scar beneath the chin, and her eyes widen in alarm.]
DDM00003004	Have a seat - came all this way, least I can do is let you rest your feet for a second.
DDM00003005	Just sit there on my little casting couch - more a chair, really, but I prefer up-and-comers to relax when I interview them.
DDM00003006	You're my guest. If you're going to be rude, you can show yourself out. Probably won't tap-dance no more when you leave, but that's on you.
DDM00003007	You standing there is making me nervous. Sit down, will you?
DDM00003008	Have a seat.
DDM00003009	...going to make casino burn, no more being...
DDM00003010	...back in the cage. Stop what you're doing, we can...
DDM00003011	...can hear you now. Not much longer, not...
DDM00003012	...listening to me. Tired of being your minder, tired...
DDM00003013	...of putting Dog to sleep, he wakes up in cage, hungry, Dog wants...
DDM00003014	...to protect you, always wanted to protect you, the reason I have to take control is...
DDM00003015	...Master. Master set me free, Dog needs to...
DDM00003016	...listen to me. If you do this, we both...
DDM00003017	...die. Dog wants to die. Don't care anymore, tired of you, tired of place. Master will...
DDM00003018	...help us. Please let me help us. If you don't, then you're...
DDM00003019	All fire now. Burn away voice, leave Dog in peace.
DDM00003020	No! Dog, get back in the c-
DDM00003021	I haven't found enough yet.
DDM00003022	Then nothing's going to keep me here... we need bait, or the beast is going to wake up, and you'll never see the Sierra Madre.
DDM00003023	Yes, this should be enough.
DDM00003024	You're good at fetching... this should keep him where he belongs. For now. I'll wait... send the signal, we'll be ready.
DDM00003025	All right, let's get out of here.
DDM00003026	Very well... lead on.
DDM00003027	You already have someone in your shadow... I'll meet you at the Villa Fountain.
DDM00003028	Meet me over at the Fountain, we'll plan our next move.
DDM00003029	Very well... to the Fountain and its ghost, then.
DDM00003030	How about 500 Chips for 500 Pre-War Bills?
DDM00003031	[You set the stack of bills down. A panel flips, there is a whir, series of clicks, and a stack of chips rises up in place of the bills.]
DDM00003032	100 Chips for 100 Pre-War bills.
DDM00003033	[You place the bills on the counter, a panel flips, taking the bills with it... and 100 Chips appear in their place.]
DDM00003034	Collect Comps
DDM00003035	[The Hologram cashier nods, then a section of the tabletop slides away, and a package rises from it.]
DDM00003036	[The Hologram cashier nods, then a section of the tabletop slides away, and a package rises from it.]
DDM00003037	[The Hologram cashier nods, takes a step back, then the whole tabletop slides away. A package slowly rises from the opening, steam trailing from it.]
DDM00003038	Let's head through the hole in the wall there - if we go backstage, we avoid the locals.
DDM00003039	Are you listening? From now on, when I talk to you, pay attention.
DDM00003040	I've left markers on your Pip-Boy - find the three other collars in town - 8, 12, and 14, get them to the Fountain. Obey me, and you can all go free.
DDM00003041	You could have left the Sierra Madre. Left this Villa, joined your own kind.
DDM00003042	Sierra Madre's mine, my heart's right where it belongs.
DDM00003043	You can't abide it. There's no heart. You hate it, I can hear it in your words.
DDM00003044	Sounds like you need your hearing checked. Sierra Madre, it's meant for me.
DDM00003045	Touched by radiation, and you choose to spend your time here. You could have just left... but you're too obsessed to let go.
DDM00003046	I used to know a ventriloquist with more skill than you. At least he had the sense to know his own name, without carving it into his chest.
DDM00003047	Mirrors tell me my name when needed... and I have a name for you, several. Thief, coward... showman. Radiation couldn't kill the truth, could it.
DDM00003048	The truth, buddy, is this: you and me, we're now family as long as we got these bowties on. So watch your mouth, you don't scare me.
DDM00003049	Where the hell did you get this one. "Dog?" What, so you don't forget your name?
DDM00003050	I don't remember you. Who are you.
DDM00003051	A little slow, huh? Uh... Dean. Dean Domino. I... live here.
DDM00003052	You look like food, smell like food. Dog - hungry.
DDM00003053	All right, pal, you stay in your corner, I'll stay in mine. Do not leave me alone with this thing.
DDM00003054	Look, you obviously hear good - even if you aren't much of a talker.
DDM00003055	[Christine's eyes narrow.]
DDM00003056	Don't get me wrong, that's a plus in my book.
DDM00003057	[Christine eyes narrow to slits.]
DDM00003058	Still, are you getting any shred of your voice healed up, or...? Like anything?
DDM00003059	Look, you obviously hear good - even if you aren't much of a talker.
DDM00003060	Eh... those scars? What happened, somebody... something carve you up, or...?
DDM00003061	[Christine frowns, tilts her head slightly.]
DDM00003062	Damn shame, hate to think if someone put you in there. Who bailed you out again, the new guy? Interesting.
DDM00003063	So... what's your story, beautiful?
DDM00003064	[Christine studies Dean, frowns.]
DDM00003065	Don't... uh... don't talk much, do you?
DDM00003066	[Christine shakes her head slowly.]
DDM00003067	All right, then. I'll just wallflower it over here.
DDM00003068	Someone wanted to cut your voice, little doll. Or they didn't finish their work, or didn't know how to.
DDM00003069	[Christine frowns.]
DDM00003070	Oh, it wasn't me... I have no use for your neck beyond what encircles it. The lack of screams when I finally kill you... that is what I'll regret.
DDM00003071	What's this? Why... it's a little doll. Were you carved by a craftsman, or mauled by a drunk who didn't know his tools?
DDM00003072	[Christine narrows her eyes, gets into a combat stance.]
DDM00003073	I'm not going to hurt you... yet. Much. Scars tell a story, some old, some new... and the one on the throat is fresh and red.
DDM00003074	Stop looking at me, you idiot. I can hear your stomach growling from here, I don't like it.
DDM00003075	Run from Dog? Dog knows how to hunt. Dog will find you, tear you apart.
DDM00003076	That a bet you want to take? Cause I'll see that and raise you a few bullets to the skull.
DDM00003077	Dog's been shot before, many times. Won't stop me from catching you.
DDM00003078	I hope you've got this one under control, because he's giving me a nasty itch on my trigger finger.
DDM00003079	Why are you so carved up - that a bear trap on your arm?
DDM00003080	Reminds me, keeps the voice out of my head. He can't talk when the pain's howling at me.
DDM00003081	Eh... wait, so you're not just slow, you're screwy, too? Some crew we are... we are never getting into the Sierra Madre.
DDM00003082	Dog is hungry. Tired of your voice... when do we eat?
DDM00003083	Don't like the way this guy is looking at me. You better be his leash.
DDM00003084	I... we... hope you've enjoyed your stay.
DDM00003085	Farewells can be a time of sadness. Letting go... difficult. As a guest of the Sierra Madre, you know that truth more than anyone.
DDM00003086	Frederick Sinclair believed one's life could be made anew every day, that fortunes were more than the wealth in your hands.
DDM00003087	Love. Life... family, those to care for, and those who will care for you.
DDM00003088	To those who know these joys, the Sierra Madre holds little they don't already have.
DDM00003089	Out in the world, beyond these walls, that is your chance to begin again.
DDM00003090	I hope you'll return, in happier times. Until then, the Sierra Madre... and I... will hold you in our hearts.
DDM00003091	Guests, and residents of the Villa alike, I ask you to step outside and look to the night sky.
DDM00003092	It's the moment you've been waiting for, the reason we're all here - the Gala Event, the Grand Opening of the Sierra Madre Casino.
DDM00003093	You are the ones who have made this momentous occasion possible, and for that, we thank you.
DDM00003094	So raise your glass in celebration - let music fill the streets, fireworks light the sky, and promise of new beginnings fill your hearts.
DDM00003095	No matter what your fortunes, no matter what your cares, let go this night, and begin again.
DDM00003096	I suggest you hurry, though - the gates of the Sierra Madre are open, but only for a brief time.
DDM00003097	After that, the doors will close for the evening's festivities, and won't open again until morning.
DDM00003098	If so, the Sierra Madre Casino, in all its glory, is inviting you to Begin Again.
DDM00003099	Come to a place where wealth, excitement, and intrigue await around every corner.
DDM00003100	Stroll along the winding streets of our beautiful resort, make new friends... or rekindle old flames.
DDM00003101	Let your eyes take in the luxurious expanse of the open desert, under clear starlit skies. Gaze straight on into the sunset from our Villa rooftops.
DDM00003102	Countless diversions await.
DDM00003103	Gamble in our casino, take in the theater, or stay in one of our exclusive executive suites that will shelter you - and cater to your every whim.
DDM00003104	So if life's worries have weighed you down... if you need an escape from your troubles... or if you just need an opportunity to begin again, join us.
DDM00003105	Let go and leave the world behind at the Sierra Madre grand opening, this October. We'll be waiting.
DDM00003106	I've been trapped in here for some time, then you come along and let me out. So... you opened my cage for a reason. Now... I want to know why.
DDM00003107	Of course you do. And so do I.
DDM00003108	Dog and I take turns in the cage... one steps out, the other goes back in. Now - what do you want?
DDM00003109	Do you see these wounds of his, covering his skin...the bear trap on his arm? He placed his own hand in it.
DDM00003110	The name he carved in his chest? To remind him of who he is, he inflicts pain on himself to silence me, when all I try to do... Hrr!
DDM00003111	...he cuts, hurts, and tries to murder me out of him. He won't succeed. Just makes me angrier.
DDM00003112	Dog is the beast, we simply change cages. Like the ones here.
DDM00003113	...hrnnn... will kill us both unless you do something. Never felt him so strong before, he won't listen to my voice. He's... he's...
DDM00003114	...hungry. Come here, or Dog will chase you, break you until you no run anymore.
DDM00003115	...hrnnn... listen to you... can't hold him back much longer... tell him... to pull on his chain, as hard as...
DDM00003116	...Dog can. What Master wants, Dog can do. Please don't be mad with Dog...
DDM00003117	...live anymore. Sick of being inside, sick of hearing his stomach screaming at me, and...
DDM00003118	...Dog is tired... Dog tired of fighting, being here... Tired of you keeping Dog caged here.
DDM00003119	...both of us are. Tell him to listen to me. Then we can get out of this... finally... and...
DDM00003120	...now Dog is listening to voice, your voice only.
DDM00003121	Uh-huh.
DDM00003122	Nnn-nnn.
DDM00003123	Who locked you in that cage?
DDM00003124	Locked myself in. Could feel myself... letting go. Dog's howling getting louder. It happens when he's hungry and no one's around to tell him... no.
DDM00003125	That name carved on your chest... are you Dog?
DDM00003126	The carving's a reminder, for mirrors and for Dog. Dog, who you heard coming in, howling and hungry, as always.
DDM00003127	What happened to your voice?
DDM00003128	I'm the voice of reason. I sleep sometimes... down in the basement, in the cage. Now that I'm awake, Dog goes back in the cage.
DDM00003129	Dog knows I'm here, but can't do anything about it. I'm his... conscience. Keep him tame, keep him from hurting us... doing foolish things.
DDM00003130	How did you end up in the Auto-Doc?
DDM00003131	[She moves her finger in a circle, frowns, then drags her hand down over her eyes. She raises them again, points to you.]
DDM00003132	Where were you before?
DDM00003133	[She moves her finger in a wider circle, then raises her hand over her eyes.]
DDM00003134	I... don't understand.
DDM00003135	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, looks impressed.]
DDM00003136	Wait... that's a Brotherhood of Steel symbol, right? You're a Scribe?
DDM00003137	[FAILED] [She shakes her head, then nods in the direction of the casino again.]
DDM00003138	So you cut your own hair off?
DDM00003139	I can't restore your voice, we'd need a real Auto-Doc to do that.
DDM00003140	[She shivers slightly, and shakes her head.]
DDM00003141	So the Auto-Doc cut your voice box, not your scalp.
DDM00003142	[Christine nods.]
DDM00003143	The Auto-Doc didn't do that?
DDM00003144	[She touches one of the scars on her cheeks, shakes head. Then touches the scar on her neck, and nods.]
DDM00003145	Were you researching something?
DDM00003146	[She shakes her head.]
DDM00003147	Were you looking for something?
DDM00003148	How the hell did you get out here?
DDM00003149	[She shrugs. Then she points to you and shrugs.]
DDM00003150	[BOS] You were a Brotherhood of Steel Scribe?
DDM00003151	[She nods. She looks impressed.]
DDM00003152	No, wait, I want to hear this. You were bald before?
DDM00003153	[She nods with an exasperated look, then makes a circle with her hands, repeats it twice more, then raises her hands and waves them like wings.]
DDM00003154	[She puts both hands in front of her, then makes a motion with her hands as if writing something.]
DDM00003155	Wait, the Auto-Doc didn't shave you bald?
DDM00003156	[She waves her hand, then shakes her head - she then nods in the direction of the casino.]
DDM00003157	I don't understand why they shaved you bald.
DDM00003158	[Christine looks blankly at you. Then touches her head, smiles, then shakes her head.]
DDM00003159	Looks like someone set the bone saws to run random.
DDM00003160	[She shakes her head... then pauses, and shakes her head again, then looks exasperated.]
DDM00003161	I had other questions.
DDM00003162	[She looks exasperated, then waves her hand in a circle in front of her.]
DDM00003163	[She raises an eyebrow, then tilts her head slightly.]
DDM00003164	[She frowns, then cups her hand to her ear.]
DDM00003165	I had questions I wanted to ask.
DDM00003166	[Christine glances straight up, frowns, then turns back to you and taps her wrist.]
DDM00003167	That Auto-Doc really carved you up.
DDM00003168	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods... slowly, then puts her hand in front her throat, closes it slowly, then points at you.]
DDM00003169	Those facial scars weren't done by the Auto-Doc - the throat scar was.
DDM00003170	[FAILED] [She frowns, narrows her eyes, and looks at you.]
DDM00003171	This is where it ends, Dean, give up.
DDM00003172	I can take a chump like you even if I didn't have eight lives lined up behind me, and a rising soundtrack. So put your dancing shoes on - let's go.
DDM00003173	How did you get up there?
DDM00003174	No idea... woke up here, thought I was dreaming for a second... right back on stage, the mic...
DDM00003175	Thought I was back at the Fronds... well, except no audience, used to pack theaters back then... so stepped up on the stage, check things out...
DDM00003176	Then suddenly Holograms walked out of the wings... and they started raising their hands to their heads all creepy-like, not a good sign.
DDM00003177	<AUDIO: Christine after Executive Suits, killed her. Static.>
DDM00003178	<AUDIO: Needs radio filter for this, and ambient sounds outside suites after Christine has been saved and is speaking to herself.>
DDM00003179	<AUDIO: Christine in Executive Suites.>
DDM00003180	<AUDIO: Christine after Executive Suites, still lost voice.>
DDM00003181	[STATIC] 
DDM00003182	[Christine frowns.] 
DDM00003183	Oh, it wasn't me... I have no use for your neck beyond what encircles it. The lack of screams when I finally kill you... that is what I'll regret.
DDM00003184	[Christine's eyes narrow.]
DDM00003185	Don't get me wrong, that's a plus in my book.
DDM00003186	[Christine eyes narrow to slits.]
DDM00003187	Still, are you getting any shred of your voice healed up, or...? Like anything?
DDM00003188	Someone wanted to cut your voice, little doll. Or they didn't finish their work, or didn't know how to.
DDM00003189	<AUDIO: If the player hasn't dropped Christine off at the Gala Event and she is alone at the fountain, this will be crackling silence.>
DDM00003190	<AUDIO: After Gala Event, not Act 3 yet.>
DDM00003191	<AUDIO: If the player has left Christine at Gala Event and she hates the player, she'll bang on the doors of the elevator to be let out.>
DDM00003192	[STATIC] 
DDM00003193	[Christine narrows her eyes, gets into a combat stance.] 
DDM00003194	I'm not going to hurt you... yet. Much. Scars tell a story, some old, some new... and the one on the throat is fresh and red.
DDM00003195	[Christine studies Dean, frowns.]
DDM00003196	Don't... eh... don't talk much, do you?
DDM00003197	[Christine shakes her head slowly.]
DDM00003198	All right, then. I'll just wallflower it over here.
DDM00003199	[Christine frowns, tilts her head slightly.]
DDM00003200	Damn shame, hate to think if someone put you in there. Who bailed you out again, the new guy? Interesting.
DDM00003201	What's this little doll? Were you carved by a craftsman, little doll, or were you mauled by a drunk who didn't know his tools?
DDM00003202	So... what's your story, beautiful?
DDM00003203	Eh... those scars? What happened, somebody... something carve you up, or...?
DDM00003204	<AUDIO: After freeing Christine, she's at the fountain or at the Clinic alone.>
DDM00003205	[STATIC] 
DDM00003206	<AUDIO: Dean's collar goes off, boom, flatline. No actual dialogue needed here.>
DDM00003207	Got to say this for Sinclair, he sure knew how to keep things locked down, the tight-assed prick.
DDM00003208	Where the hell did everyone else go?
DDM00003209	Wonder what happened to the suckers. Might have gotten taken away, like I did? Hnh.
DDM00003210	Hnh. Theater's almost the same as it was.
DDM00003211	Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure.
DDM00003212	First time on stage in a hundred years, and it has to be this?
DDM00003213	Need some help here... and that audience is not looking friendly.
DDM00003214	Hope my partner fared better than I did... better not have left me high and dry, get-even's not going to be pretty.
DDM00003215	That audience... better lay low, get a feel for the crowd.
DDM00003216	Good thing, someone walks in here, they're toast.
DDM00003217	I am out of here... well, not to the Villa, just out of the damn theater first chance I get.
DDM00003218	This place... hasn't changed at all.
DDM00003219	Run from Dog? Dog knows how to hunt. Dog will find you, tear you apart.
DDM00003220	That a bet you want to take? Cause I'll see that and raise you a few bullets to the skull.
DDM00003221	Dog's been shot before, many times. Won't stop me from catching you.
DDM00003222	Hope you've got this one under control because he's giving me a nasty itch on my trigger finger.
DDM00003223	Didn't come all this way to get conned by some tourist.
DDM00003224	We'll see who's holding the cards in the end...
DDM00003225	The joke's on you, "partners." You aren't getting to the prize without me.
DDM00003226	This is a fine how do you do.
DDM00003227	Should have blown up that seat cushion right when they sat down, would've been a better end than this.
DDM00003228	Just finish the last job, Dean. It's all you've wanted, just hang in there.
DDM00003229	Keep your head down, Dean, don't let the locals see you.
DDM00003230	Sinclair, you better appreciate all I do to screw you over.
DDM00003231	That tourist is better than most. Probably won't matter.
DDM00003232	Town's going to be filled with Ghosts when the sky lights up.
DDM00003233	The linked collars is a new trick. Can't say I like it much.
DDM00003234	Waiting for the fireworks. Just like last time.
DDM00003235	Can't wait to see their faces when they find out what the lock is. Just gotta wait 'em out.
DDM00003236	Place is going to be swarming with the masks when the sky lights up.
DDM00003237	Not much time to get to the gates before they shut the door and turn folks away.
DDM00003238	Holy Mary, Mother, and Joe - now there's a show.
DDM00003239	All right, now - I'm out of here.
DDM00003240	If the Ghost People didn't know we were here before, they know now.
DDM00003241	Someone struck up the band. A band of tortured cats.
DDM00003242	What kind of casino has two Grand Openings?
DDM00003243	This is your last hurrah, Sinclair, I promise you.
DDM00003244	Just my luck.
DDM00003245	Luck's finally shining down on me.
DDM00003246	You wait, beautiful. Keep that gate open for me, Dean'll be there soon.
DDM00003247	Sierra Madre, sweetheart, Dean's coming home.
DDM00003248	Stop looking at me, you idiot. I can hear your stomach growling from here, I don't like it.
DDM00003249	<AUDIO: Dog dies in the Kitchen, boom, then flatlines, just an explosion and flatline is needed.>
DDM00003250	I... he's asleep. Finally. Shhhhhh.
DDM00003251	Dog... all I wanted was for you to listen to me, let me care for you. Keep you from hurting yourself...
DDM00003252	Now I can. And one day, when you're ready, I'll let you out. When you're calm, and we... understand each other.
DDM00003253	And we're at peace, you and I, mind and instinct. Then the world will be ready for us.
DDM00003254	Hello? Voice? You there? It's Dog......Dog can hear himself. Voice is... is in cage? Locked.
DDM00003255	Now Dog speak. Now Dog not afraid. And... hungry. More hungry.
DDM00003256	Dog find food... tear apart food, eat. Chase it down, can't run, feed. Finally, until Dog is full.
DDM00003257	What is this place?
DDM00003258	Feel strange, like... sleeping. On my neck, is this... a chain? I... what's carved on my chest.
DDM00003259	"God." No... not God. Something in reverse... hnh. Was that one of them...?
DDM00003260	Should rest, get my strength back... then explore this place, see what it holds.
DDM00003261	...going to make casino burn, no more being...
DDM00003262	...back in the cage. Stop what you're doing, we can...
DDM00003263	...can hear you now. Not much longer, not...
DDM00003264	...listening to me. Tired of being your minder, tired...
DDM00003265	...of putting Dog to sleep, he wakes up in cage, hungry, Dog wants...
DDM00003266	...to protect you, always wanted to protect you, the reason I have to take control is...
DDM00003267	...Master. Master set me free, Dog needs to...
DDM00003268	...listen to me. If you do this, we both...
DDM00003269	...die. Dog wants to die. Don't care anymore, tired of you, tired of place. Master will...
DDM00003270	...help us. Please let me help us. If you don't, then you're...
DDM00003271	Hnh. The human pulled it off.
DDM00003272	Just like last time. Come on, Dog, you know the drill.
DDM00003273	What the Old World saw in these light shows is beyond me.
DDM00003274	The human did it. Good.
DDM00003275	Not going down like last time - Dog, you're staying in the cage.
DDM00003276	Time to get to the gate, "friends" or no friends.
DDM00003277	Fires and speakers are going to bring the Ghost People out in full.
DDM00003278	Coming for you, human... you just wait.
DDM00003279	Madre's mine.
DDM00003280	So hungry.
DDM00003281	Insides growling.
DDM00003282	:: Mournful whining to self ::
DDM00003283	Hope the voice doesn't come back. Mean. Bad.
DDM00003284	:: Stomach rumbling.::
DDM00003285	Need to stay out of sight... can't afford to be distracted now.
DDM00003286	Sierra Madre's mine, my heart's right where it belongs.
DDM00003287	You can't abide it. There's no heart. You hate it, I can hear it in your words.
DDM00003288	Sounds like you need your hearing checked. Sierra Madre, it's meant for me.
DDM00003289	You could have left the Sierra Madre. Left this Villa, joined your own kind.
DDM00003290	Where are lights. Dog want to see the lights.
DDM00003291	Can't wait to see the lights.
DDM00003292	:: Impatient Growl ::
DDM00003293	Hurry up, Dog doesn't like being here.
DDM00003294	Got to go... Casin-oooo.
DDM00003295	Didn't... we do this before? Can't remember.
DDM00003296	Want show and lights and yelling to start.
DDM00003297	:: Weeping. ::
DDM00003298	:: Whimpering ::
DDM00003299	:: Howling in frustration ::
DDM00003300	Please let me out.
DDM00003301	Dog is sorry, sorry, sorry.
DDM00003302	What did I do?
DDM00003303	Lights and fire.
DDM00003304	Pretty.
DDM00003305	Lots of noise.
DDM00003306	Where is Master? Did Master make fires in the sky?
DDM00003307	:: Delighted clapping ::
DDM00003308	Nooooooooooo!
DDM00003309	:: Howling, frightened. ::
DDM00003310	Let me out, let me out!
DDM00003311	Noise hurts, noise hurts!
DDM00003312	Streets are hurting my ears!
DDM00003313	Too bright, too bright.
DDM00003314	Hurry, we're targets out here.
DDM00003315	Almost inside. Finally. Then I can get rid of the baggage.
DDM00003316	Quiet, Dog, stay in the cage.
DDM00003317	Sick of these Old World deathtraps.
DDM00003318	The Sierra Madre's almost mine.
DDM00003319	They better not try and leave me here...
DDM00003320	When this festival fires, I'm the first one in the door.
DDM00003321	Last time I ever deal with human trash...
DDM00003322	After the Bomb, still slaves to technology, events, Pip-Boys, collars... hnnnr.
DDM00003323	I'll whip you for this, Dog. I'll crush your cage with you inside it for making me go through this.
DDM00003324	All this - if I get inside the Sierra Madre, it's all worth it. All of it.
DDM00003325	As soon as those collars go off... we'll settle things, yes.
DDM00003326	The human did it. Good.
DDM00003327	Not going down like last time - Dog, you're staying in the cage.
DDM00003328	Time to get to the gate, "friends" or no friends.
DDM00003329	Fires and speakers are going to bring the Ghost People out in full.
DDM00003330	Coming for you, human... you just wait.
DDM00003331	Madre's mine.
DDM00003332	Hnh. The human pulled it off.
DDM00003333	Just like last time. Come on, Dog, you know the drill.
DDM00003334	Gate won't be open for long.
DDM00003335	Need to stay out of sight... can't afford to be distracted now.
DDM00003336	What the Old World saw in these light shows is beyond me.
DDM00003337	Used to know a ventriloquist with more skill than you, at least he had the sense to know his own name without carving it into his chest.
DDM00003338	Mirrors tell me my name when needed... and I have a name for you, several. Thief, coward... showman. Radiation couldn't kill the truth, could it.
DDM00003339	The truth, buddy, is this: you and me, we're now family as long as we got these bowties on. So watch your mouth, you don't scare me.
DDM00003340	Touched by radiation, and you choose to spend your time here. You could have just left... but you're too obsessed to let go.
DDM00003341	:: Impatient Growl ::
DDM00003342	:: Weeping. ::
DDM00003343	:: Whimpering ::
DDM00003344	:: Howling in frustration ::
DDM00003345	Please let me out.
DDM00003346	Dog is sorry, sorry, sorry.
DDM00003347	What did I do?
DDM00003348	Let me out, let me out!
DDM00003349	So hungry.
DDM00003350	Don't like this place. Want to go back, back to the base. Or the Church, miss the Church.
DDM00003351	Insides growling.
DDM00003352	:: Mournful whining to self ::
DDM00003353	Hope the voice doesn't come back. Mean. Bad.
DDM00003354	Where is Master? Did he go away? Dog will be good this time.
DDM00003355	Swallowed something bad. Taste like burnt wires.
DDM00003356	:: Stomach rumbling.::
DDM00003357	Can't believe the idiot swallowed his collar.
DDM00003358	What's taking that human so long.
DDM00003359	If that human wasn't wearing a collar...
DDM00003360	Wonder what that human's insides would look like laid out over the fountain.
DDM00003361	Might be able to rip the Pip-Boy off his arm without killing him. Hmm.
DDM00003362	Air tastes like copper. Or Old World gold.
DDM00003363	Almost got away... then the idiot's hunger screws it up.
DDM00003364	Quiet, Dog, stay in the cage.
DDM00003365	I don't remember you. Who are you.
DDM00003366	A little slow, huh? Uh... Dean. Dean Domino. I... live here.
DDM00003367	You look like food, smell like food. Dog - hungry.
DDM00003368	All right, pal, you stay in your corner, I'll stay in mine. Do not leave me alone with this thing.
DDM00003369	Reminds me, keeps the voice out of my head. He can't talk when the pain's howling at me.
DDM00003370	Wait, so you're not just slow, you're screwy, too? Some crew we are... we are never getting into the Sierra Madre.
DDM00003371	Dog is hungry. Tired of your voice... when do we eat?
DDM00003372	Don't like the way this guy is looking at me. You better be his leash.
DDM00003373	Where the hell did you get this one. "Dog?" What, so you don't forget your name?
DDM00003374	Why are you so carved up - that a bear trap on your arm?
DDM00003375	You'd think it was Spring the way tourists keep rolling in.
DDM00003376	That one's got a head on their shoulders. For now.
DDM00003377	Hope that tourist is hurrying, haven't got all day.
DDM00003378	At least this one seems like a straight shooter. Or sucker.
DDM00003379	That tourist crosses me, they'll regret it. Even if they don't, they still might.
DDM00003380	Should never have set that radio signal on repeat.
DDM00003381	Can you hear me? Signal should be stronger in here. I'll set this on loop... just in case I need to step away for a moment.
DDM00003382	When the bombs hit, this casino sealed up like an Emperor's tomb. If you don't know what that means, never mind, it means we're trapped.
DDM00003383	So - get the power running to the main floor. That'll open the elevators and unlock the doors.
DDM00003384	The ones that didn't strip their gears when they locked into place, Old World junk. Shoddy workmanship.
DDM00003385	Once the power's on, then I'll tell you your next steps. Just get this part done, and then listen.
DDM00003386	If you're wondering where your crew is, well... the casino saw them as guests. Which means they all got assigned to their floor. Just like mine.
DDM00003387	Don't worry about them, they're of no use if you can't get the power running.
DDM00003388	All I need is you for the rest of this. Which means we just need to deal with them, one by one, and then the Vault's... ours.
DDM00003389	Ha! You got the power on, excellent. You were quite a find, glad my trap in the desert caught you before time ran out.
DDM00003390	And also glad you didn't come across this place first, might have plundered it first... can't have that. Like at HELIOS. And Hoover Dam.
DDM00003391	All right, setting this on repeat in case you're some idiot-savant braincase and need the reminder...
DDM00003392	So, my greedy friend, we've got some unfinished business. I'm not one to share, and there's loose ends we need to wrap up first.
DDM00003393	The rest of your team is on different floors. They got assigned there, ushered there based on the casino's records as to the best "fit."
DDM00003394	Don't ask me how, Pre-War casino security and escort systems aren't my specialty.
DDM00003395	Go to each floor, and kill them. I don't need them anymore... well, now that you're here.
DDM00003396	We don't need anyone... except each other. Together, we'll crack the Sierra Madre, and we can both leave this place behind.
DDM00003397	Now... if anything about our little heist went smoothly, you'd go to the Vault... except it's locked by some code I'm not familiar with.
DDM00003398	The door to the casino vault is hidden in the Executive Suites, without the means to unlock it, it's useless.
DDM00003399	Find a way to open it, bypass the code, then we'll talk.
DDM00003400	You did it... a voice lock. Why would he have done that? Uh! Never mind.
DDM00003401	Now I just need you to go below, look around. See if there's any other surprises down there.
DDM00003402	I'll be along once you've found the Vault. No need risking myself just yet.
DDM00003403	End of line.
DDM00003404	What the hell was that?
DDM00003405	The Gala Event... finally. Probably wake up half the things in town.
DDM00003406	Power's fluctuating in here... getting some systems waking up, good, good.
DDM00003407	Now all they have to do is just get here. Tired of waiting.
DDM00003408	Hurry... hurry... you just need to get inside, I'll handle the rest. Come on, you fools.
DDM00003409	Not far now... soon, the Sierra Madre's mine. Doors won't hold open forever... just like the last time. Come on.
DDM00003410	All right, now everything's coming together...
DDM00003411	Just need to keep their gears turning a little while longer...
DDM00003412	Can't believe this old Pip-Boy saved me. Even if it led me to that damn signal in the first place.
DDM00003413	Good thing the new recruit had a Pip-Boy, too, probably stole it from a Vault 21 dweller. Still, a thief's just what I need for this.
DDM00003414	If only the others would've obeyed orders half as well as this one... should have thought of linking the collars together the first few times.
DDM00003415	Good thing I can still hook into the Villa speakers by remote...
DDM00003416	Damn Hologram tech. Worthless as security... better as weapons.
DDM00003417	What the hell are they doing out there. Hurry up, you idiots, I don't have a few more years to waste.
DDM00003418	Outwitted by doors. Hermetically sealed doors don't protect anyone, all they do is seal us in.
DDM00003419	Why the owner tied all of this to the Gala Event, insanity... backwards thinking, having a festival be your key. No wonder the bombs fell.
DDM00003420	Still can't figure out why I lost the signals...
DDM00003421	There's no reason why it could have gone wrong, had it all planned out... maybe it was the curse of the Sierra Madre.
DDM00003422	Damn Cloud still in my lungs, rattling around.
DDM00003423	<AUDIO: Clatter of wrench dropping>Dammit, get back here.
DDM00003424	Good thing I installed radios in the collars, Pip-Boy's letting me pick them up.
DDM00003425	What the hell is 21 doing now... hnh.
DDM00003426	Fool better not decide to sleep. Vitals go down, I'll get someone else to do this job.
DDM00003427	Unnn... sitting too long. Damn arthritis.
DDM00003428	Come too far to go back now. Too far.
DDM00003429	Hnh. Going to wipe the slate clean. Kimball, the Republic... Hardin, McNamara, my "brothers." Then I'll head back West.
DDM00003430	Better loop some instructions in case something happens.
DDM00003431	Going to get inside this place if it's the last thing I do.
DDM00003432	Running out of volunteers. Last ones couldn't see beyond their own greed.
DDM00003433	If only people would do what I say, wouldn't need these damn collars to keep them in line. Keep going for each other's throats like dogs.
DDM00003434	Wish I... still had that damn Holorifle. Spent forever making it... need to find it when this is all done.
DDM00003435	What are we doing in here? Planning to toss me in a cell?
DDM00003436	Going to be sad to leave the Residential District. Well... not really.
DDM00003437	Sure left a lot of traps around. Sometimes I forget where they are.
DDM00003438	As worse as the other places are? This section of town is the most dangerous.
DDM00003439	We need to get out of here - come alone if you want, don't drag me here.
DDM00003440	Hear there's a belltower and church to the North... filled with Ghost People.
DDM00003441	The cafe survived? How about that. Had great coffee - and one of the waitresses? Rhonda? Piece. Of. Work.
DDM00003442	Do not leave me here.
DDM00003443	Never liked the Chief here, real stickler for "policy."
DDM00003444	Made off with a lot of mines, shotguns, and explosives from here... wasn't easy with the Ghost People around.
DDM00003445	Got a worse grease smell down here than Danny Parker's hair on Opening Night.
DDM00003446	What are we doing here for? This place is... well, it's haunted.
DDM00003447	Seriously, we should get out of here. The Security Holograms... shoot on sight, and you can't even hurt them.
DDM00003448	Salida del Sol - "Sunrise." Not much to look at now.
DDM00003449	You sure came a long way to rob this place. Guess greed is in the blood.
DDM00003450	Breath of fresh air in here... literally. If you need to take a breather from the Cloud, this is a good spot.
DDM00003451	Might be a nice place to hole up for a while.
DDM00003452	Check the fountains, might have some wishes... er, chips we can snag.
DDM00003453	Watch the ground for bear traps and any openings for tripwires.
DDM00003454	Ghost People.
DDM00003455	If I ever had to come here, I stuck to the overhangs and roofs - like sidewalks up there.
DDM00003456	Like a toxic ashtray down here.
DDM00003457	Find a way to get this place hopping again... would clean all the toxic gas out of Puesta del Sol.
DDM00003458	Stinks down here. And I can barely smell anything.
DDM00003459	Sure glad one of us knows what you're doing.
DDM00003460	You know, this used to be a nice town. Well, nice enough.
DDM00003461	When in doubt, step quiet - and watch where you step.
DDM00003462	Where there's a bear trap, Ghost People aren't far behind.
DDM00003463	Watch out if you see a prize lying around - the Ghost People leave "supplies" as traps.
DDM00003464	Getting real tired of tourist season - no offense, but you guys are lowering the bar.
DDM00003465	Cloud wasn't always here. Grew over the years, even without cars or factories.
DDM00003466	Sierra Madre may wait. Not me.
DDM00003467	Sierra Madre's not getting any younger.
DDM00003468	What's next?
DDM00003469	I want to know more about the Master.
DDM00003470	I need you to get to your Gala Event position.
DDM00003471	Maybe Dog will obey you. I'm not as easily broken.
DDM00003472	That's enough for now.
DDM00003473	We'll see.
DDM00003474	Who's this Old Man who brought us here?
DDM00003475	I had questions for you.
DDM00003476	Yes, Master.
DDM00003477	I had questions for you.
DDM00003478	I'm sure you do.
DDM00003479	You'd think it was Spring the way tourists keep rolling in.
DDM00003480	That one's got a head on their shoulders. For now.
DDM00003481	Hope that tourist is hurrying, haven't got all day.
DDM00003482	At least this one seems like a straight shooter. Or sucker.
DDM00003483	That tourist crosses me, they'll regret it. Even if they don't, they still might.
DDM00003484	Should never have set that radio signal on repeat.
DDM00003485	It's letting go.
DDM00003486	You've heard of the Sierra Madre Casino.
DDM00003487	Something... wrong in the air.
DDM00003488	The quick... the quick scribe... jumped over the lazy paladin.
DDM00003489	Mi-mo-mih.
DDM00003490	This is Knight Christine Royce, of the Brotherhood... Christine Royce.
DDM00003491	Ugh... feels like a sore throat - after chewing on nails.
DDM00003492	Sounds like I smoked a mile of cigarettes.
DDM00003493	Feels like the Cloud crawled in my mouth and died.
DDM00003494	Chris-tine. Chris-tine. Hello. Hello. Hello.
DDM00003495	[Christine makes a sweeping motion of the room, does a deep inhalation, then gives a thumbs up.]
DDM00003496	[Christine sniffs the air, then gives a thumbs up.]
DDM00003497	[Christine's breathing quickens, and her eyes dart around the walls.]
DDM00003498	[Christine seems to be sweating heavily, and her hand is twitching slightly. She looks ready to bolt.]
DDM00003499	[Christine nods at the ground, points at her eyes, then points at the ground again, as if in warning.]
DDM00003500	[Christine motions at ground, makes a snapping motion with her hand, then taps her eyes and pantomimes walking slowly, looking in front of her.]
DDM00003501	[Christine scans the area. She seems on edge, checking the arcades and arches for movement.]
DDM00003502	[Christine makes a motion of loading a fake gun, then suiting up.]
DDM00003503	Can't believe I came all this way to have my voice stolen.
DDM00003504	So, what, you're going to risk blowing off your own head to kill me?
DDM00003505	No, I'm not. I'll get out in time - you won't. Once I kill you, exit stage left, and my collar will go quiet.
DDM00003506	All the world's a stage. Soon your brains will be all over it.
DDM00003507	Don't have time for the song and dance, Dean.
DDM00003508	I know you didn't do it out of the goodness of your heart. So... instead of empty words and a flourish, let me give you something more useful.
DDM00003509	Yeah, lucky us. Love getting shot at by Pre-War ghosts.
DDM00003510	Look, I'm more about the short goodbyes than long thankful speeches... but I appreciate you bailing me out of a tight spot there - partner.
DDM00003511	I know you didn't do it out of the goodness of your heart. So let me give you something a little more practical - a way we both come out ahead.
DDM00003512	Casino security hit you like it hit me when you reached the lobby?
DDM00003513	Do you know what happened to the others?
DDM00003514	If you think you can take me, come down and try it.
DDM00003515	No... no, no... I'm not leaving this spot. Why dirty my hands when the Sierra Madre can kill you for me?
DDM00003516	Time for a little show - I'll just grab a seat and watch how this plays out from backstage. Security can handle it from here.
DDM00003517	Don't act stupid. Let's get out of here.
DDM00003518	Stupid? No, playing it smart. You're the dumb one, waltzing in here without realizing who the headliner is.
DDM00003519	So, stabbing me in the back for the Sierra Madre?
DDM00003520	You think I'm the bad guy here? I'm not the one slapping bomb collars on innocent folks and flicking the switch.
DDM00003521	And I'm not stabbing you in the back. I was facing you all the time. This heist? I planned it lifetimes ago. You and that old man? Tourists.
DDM00003522	Hurry, would you? Get me out of this mess. Got to sue my agent for this.
DDM00003523	Get me out of here, they've got me trapped!
DDM00003524	Hold it together, Dean, you've been in worse jams. Like Madrid. Christ - Madrid.
DDM00003525	How long you think you can keep dancing around out there? Song's going to end soon, you along with it.
DDM00003526	You won't get out of here alive. Even if you reach me, you don't have the guts to fight.
DDM00003527	I'm calling the tune here - this is my theater, my show, I've waited my life to get back here. You? Not even worth the time it'd take to kill you.
DDM00003528	I'm listening.
DDM00003529	What do you mean?
DDM00003530	And if she is alive?
DDM00003531	Then she can make some beautiful music. I'm not banking on it.
DDM00003532	So you're going to prove it now? How?
DDM00003533	I didn't know at first. Then the old man showed up. You showed up. Then... that woman showed up, covered in scars.
DDM00003534	The one who makes all the hand signs, a little tight around the corners of her mouth.
DDM00003535	I put her in the Clinic, tuned her like an instrument. If she heals up, it's not going to be her voice speaking any more.
DDM00003536	That is, if the Sierra Madre didn't get her. If it did... well, there's enough of Vera around for me to spend a few years piecing a book together.
DDM00003537	Forget Sinclair. If Vera was the key, she's dead.
DDM00003538	I only saw her yesterday. Well, a few yesterdays.
DDM00003539	But what did he do to you?
DDM00003540	Do to me? What, weren't you listening? He thought he was better than me. Don't believe me? Look around.
DDM00003541	This big casino, this big colossal monument - think it was for some woman? No, all ego, all self-righteous-in-lights, fit him perfect.
DDM00003542	Had to take him down a few pegs, bring him down to my level. "Begin again?" Some things you don't get up from... I was going to prove it.
DDM00003543	What was your problem with Sinclair?
DDM00003544	Problem? All high-and-mighty. Lording it over everyone. Acting so self-righteous, like nothing could touch him. He was the one with the problem.
DDM00003545	Never got mad at anything. Nothing seemed to shake him. Even after... his life kept getting dragged through the dirt.
DDM00003546	Always kept looking for the bright, shining future in everything. So... I decided to take everything from him.
DDM00003547	So what happened?
DDM00003548	The Bomb. Vera got sealed in here. A few hundred years go by, give-or-take. Almost the end of the story - then you came along.
DDM00003549	Now we finish the job. Rob the Sierra Madre, rip out its heart. Last chapter of Frederick Sinclair, close the book.
DDM00003550	Go on.
DDM00003551	All she had to do was get inside the Sierra Madre for the Gala, then use her voice to open the door. After that... smooth sailing.
DDM00003552	Would have been the biggest heist in history. Sinclair left holding the bag. Ruined.
DDM00003553	Forget the history lesson, get to the point.
DDM00003554	How so?
DDM00003555	Sinclair was already puppy-eyed, so all I had to do was the introductions. She smiled, fluttered her eyes, showed a little leg...
DDM00003556	...and he built this whole place for her. Made her the key to his vault, like a joke, cause of her name. Her fake Hollywood name.
DDM00003557	Except Sinclair didn't know I'd been there first. I could twist her whatever direction I wanted.
DDM00003558	All right, I'll head out and see what I can do on my end.
DDM00003559	Go knock yourself out. I'm just going to catch my breath a bit. That performance... well, more pressure than I was expecting.
DDM00003560	So you don't know the phrase?
DDM00003561	No, that I still had to figure out - still do. Sinclair wrote stuff down, was obsessive about it. Just got to find where.
DDM00003562	Voice?
DDM00003563	Yeah, the woman, the Starlet, Vera - her voice. Didn't realize there was so many holotapes of her still around, otherwise... eh, never mind.
DDM00003564	Tell me. The short version.
DDM00003565	Elevator's up in the Executive Suites. Voice-activated. Speak the right phrase, in the right tone of voice, and it's open sesame.
DDM00003566	I was able to snag the voice, or thought I had. The right tone and phrasing... well, that may take some time.
DDM00003567	What do you mean?
DDM00003568	There's a private elevator, Sinclair's elevator. It's up in the Executive Suites, in Vera's room. Not a coincidence.
DDM00003569	Vera. She was... my other partner, before the Bomb. Took some legwork. Some convincing, made it happen.
DDM00003570	[Christine stares at the headless corpses for a second. Then she makes a slow, angry scowl.]
DDM00003571	There's a picture, a bunch of headless saps all waiting for the pearly gates. Whoever did this... messed up.
DDM00003572	First time on stage in a hundred years, and it has to be this?
DDM00003573	Hnh. Theater's almost the same as it was.
DDM00003574	Where the hell did everyone else go?
DDM00003575	Need some help here... and that audience is not looking friendly.
DDM00003576	Hope my partner fared better than I did... better not have left me high and dry, get-even's not going to be pretty.
DDM00003577	Hnh. Theater's almost the same as it was.
DDM00003578	This place... hasn't changed at all.
DDM00003579	Wonder what happened to the suckers. Might have gotten taken away, like I did?
DDM00003580	That audience... better lay low, get a feel for the crowd.
DDM00003581	Good thing, someone walks in here, they're toast.
DDM00003582	I am out of here... well, not to the Villa, just out of the damn theater first chance I get.
DDM00003583	Got to say this for Sinclair, he sure knew how to keep things locked down, the tight-assed prick.
DDM00003584	Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure.
DDM00003585	Why don't you come with me, whatever else you're here for, not my concern.
DDM00003586	You're looking for something else. Fine, I can help.
DDM00003587	[She studies you again, then her expression softens slightly. She shakes her head slowly, and gives a silent sigh.]
DDM00003588	[She nods at you, then raises an eyebrow and nods at the door.]
DDM00003589	What exactly is wrong? Don't you want out of here?
DDM00003590	Look, I'm not trying to order you. But your life is tied to mine.
DDM00003591	[She frowns, glances at the collar, looks back at you. She makes a circle with her hands, puts her hand over her eyes and squints.]
DDM00003592	[She nods at you, then lowers her hand from her eyes, shakes her head. She draws a slow line between you.]
DDM00003593	Get going. I'll meet you at the Fountain in the center of the Villa.
DDM00003594	[Christine gives a brief nod, then turns and begins to walk.]
DDM00003595	Fine. Would hate to have carved you up anymore than you are.
DDM00003596	[Christine's defeated expression vanishes into a stone-faced glare.]
DDM00003597	Glad we understand each other. Let's go.
DDM00003598	[Christine narrows her eyes slightly. She slowly nods, then steps slightly behind you.]
DDM00003599	[Christine glances at your follower, shakes her head, then points at you, her, and nods in the direction of the fountain.]
DDM00003600	I let you out of the Auto-Doc. I can put you back in there just as fast.
DDM00003601	[Her eyes widen, and her eyes gauge yours. She then touches her wounds, and her expression crumbles into anger, as if defeated. She slowly nods.]
DDM00003602	... a monument to wealth.
DDM00003603	It was built before the War, a tower of gold and lights, where fortunes could be gained and lost...
DDM00003604	A bright, shining monument luring treasure hunters to their doom.
DDM00003605	Foolishness about it lying in the middle of the City of the Dead, buried beneath a blood-red cloud.
DDM00003606	We all have, the legend, the curses.
DDM00003607	What the blazes... piece of junk! You rigged that terminal, didn't you. Didn't want security showing you out, eh? We'll see.
DDM00003608	Hnh. Maybe I can shut down these ghosts using the Stage Manager's old termin... dammit! Well, so much for that idea.
DDM00003609	You... partner, are you a sight for sore eyes. Unfriendly crowd tonight, in a lethal way - if you could calm the house down, I'd be grateful.
DDM00003610	Hey... guess who finally showed. You weren't on the guest list. Guess I'll need to call security, have them show you the door.
DDM00003611	So... you think you have what it takes to beat me, on my stage, in my town? Come on down, we'll see.
DDM00003612	Don't do it. Leave that projector alone - I'm warning you.
DDM00003613	So... can't leave well enough alone, have to enter Vera's room. Some things are better left in the past, "partner."
DDM00003614	Now, now... that's my room. You want your own dressing room, you have to work for it.
DDM00003615	Oh, man... nice job. Good thing I was distracting them while you flicked them off. We're a good team - I run the show while you run the box office.
DDM00003616	All right, now calm the audience down and let's go home. And when my part plays, no cracking jokes - that was the hairstyle back then, all right?
DDM00003617	Hey, you're making real progress, good. Uh, look that's... Vera's room, so careful what you touch in there, be respectful.
DDM00003618	Hey, you found my old room. I mean, it's a little small... and hey, watch the hands in there, I remember where I left everything, got it?
DDM00003619	Fine. Meet at the Fountain?
DDM00003620	I'm in. If that's all, let's head out.
DDM00003621	Hnh. The human pulled it off.
DDM00003622	Just like last time. Come on, Dog, you know the drill.
DDM00003623	Gate won't be open for long.
DDM00003624	Need to stay out of sight... can't afford to be distracted now.
DDM00003625	What the Old World saw in these light shows is beyond me.
DDM00003626	The human did it. Good.
DDM00003627	Not going down like last time - Dog, you're staying in the cage.
DDM00003628	Time to get to the gate, "friends" or no friends.
DDM00003629	Fires and speakers are going to bring the Ghost People out in full.
DDM00003630	Coming for you, human... you just wait.
DDM00003631	Madre's mine.
DDM00003632	When this festival fires, I'm the first one in the door.
DDM00003633	Last time I ever deal with human trash...
DDM00003634	After the Bomb, still slaves to technology, events, Pip-Boys, collars... hnnnr.
DDM00003635	I'll whip you for this, Dog. I'll crush your cage with you inside it for making me go through this.
DDM00003636	All this - if I get inside the Sierra Madre, it's all worth it. All of it.
DDM00003637	As soon as those collars go off... we'll settle things, yes.
DDM00003638	Hurry, we're targets out here.
DDM00003639	Almost inside. Finally. Then I can get rid of the baggage.
DDM00003640	Quiet, Dog, stay in the cage.
DDM00003641	Sick of these Old World deathtraps.
DDM00003642	The Sierra Madre's almost mine.
DDM00003643	They better not try and leave me here...
DDM00003644	No toxins in the air in here.
DDM00003645	Well, this place has seen better days.
DDM00003646	If we need to fight, you should call Dog out... as much as I hate to admit it.
DDM00003647	Might be able to use the gas valves around here to set traps of our own.
DDM00003648	We'll need to move faster than this if we're going to outwit the Old Man.
DDM00003649	Happy you followed the Sierra Madre broadcast? Curiosity and greed, same thing.
DDM00003650	It's your own fault you're here. Couldn't leave well enough alone.
DDM00003651	That Pip-Boy... maybe I'll tear it off your arm, wear it on my neck.
DDM00003652	Air tastes like copper. Or Old World gold.
DDM00003653	Almost got away... then the idiot's hunger screws it up.
DDM00003654	Why do you keep looking at your Pip-Boy? It won't help. Didn't help the Old Man.
DDM00003655	Can't believe the idiot swallowed his collar.
DDM00003656	Can't believe the idiot swallowed his collar.
DDM00003657	What's taking that human so long.
DDM00003658	If that human wasn't wearing a collar...
DDM00003659	Wonder what that human's insides would look like laid out over the fountain.
DDM00003660	Might be able to rip the Pip-Boy off his arm without killing him. Hmm.
DDM00003661	Nooooooooooo!
DDM00003662	:: Howling, frightened. ::
DDM00003663	Let me out, let me out!
DDM00003664	Noise hurts, noise hurts!
DDM00003665	Streets are hurting my ears!
DDM00003666	Too bright, too bright.
DDM00003667	Lights and fire.
DDM00003668	Pretty.
DDM00003669	Lots of noise.
DDM00003670	Where is Master? Did Master make fires in the sky?
DDM00003671	:: Delighted clapping ::
DDM00003672	:: Weeping. ::
DDM00003673	:: Whimpering ::
DDM00003674	:: Howling in frustration ::
DDM00003675	Please let me out.
DDM00003676	Dog is sorry, sorry, sorry.
DDM00003677	What did I do?
DDM00003678	Where are lights. Dog want to see the lights.
DDM00003679	Can't wait to see the lights.
DDM00003680	:: Impatient Growl ::
DDM00003681	Hurry up, Dog doesn't like being here.
DDM00003682	Got to go... Casin-oooo.
DDM00003683	Didn't... we do this before? Can't remember.
DDM00003684	Want show and lights and yelling to start.
DDM00003685	Really dark down here. Smell like oil and 'tronics.
DDM00003686	Dog not like this place. Air smells like burnt sparks and blood.
DDM00003687	Cafe. Food place. Maybe something in kitchen?
DDM00003688	Like it here.
DDM00003689	When Dog catch a Ghost in plastic, Dog tear him apart so they don't get back up.
DDM00003690	Smells like... flesh in plastic... lots of food around here. We should catch some.
DDM00003691	Lots of marks on walls from other dead people. They not get far.
DDM00003692	Hope the voice doesn't come back. Mean. Bad.
DDM00003693	Where is Master? Did he go away? Dog will be good this time.
DDM00003694	Swallowed something bad. Taste like burnt wires.
DDM00003695	Always yell at Dog. Yell at Dog because gets hungry, can't stop it... always need more.
DDM00003696	Insides growling.
DDM00003697	So hungry.
DDM00003698	Don't like this place. Want to go back, back to the Base. Or the Church, miss the Church.
DDM00003699	Air in here not burn chest.
DDM00003700	:: Mournful whining to self ::
DDM00003701	:: Stomach rumbling.::
DDM00003702	Holy Mary, Mother, and Joe - now there's a show.
DDM00003703	Not much time to get to the gates before they shut the door and turn folks away.
DDM00003704	All right, now - I'm out of here.
DDM00003705	If the Ghost People didn't know we were here before, they know now.
DDM00003706	Someone struck up the band. A band of tortured cats.
DDM00003707	What kind of casino has two Grand Openings?
DDM00003708	This is your last hurrah, Sinclair, I promise you.
DDM00003709	Just my luck.
DDM00003710	Luck's finally shining down on me.
DDM00003711	You wait, beautiful. Keep that gate open for me, Dean'll be there soon.
DDM00003712	Sierra Madre, sweetheart, Dean's coming home.
DDM00003713	Sinclair, you better appreciate all I do to screw you over.
DDM00003714	That tourist is better than most. Eh... probably won't matter.
DDM00003715	The linked collars is a new trick. Can't say I like it much.
DDM00003716	Waiting for the fireworks. Just like last time.
DDM00003717	Can't wait to see their faces when they find out what the lock is. Just gotta wait 'em out.
DDM00003718	Place is going to be swarming with the masks when the sky lights up.
DDM00003719	We'll see who's holding the cards in the end...
DDM00003720	Didn't come all this way to get conned by some tourist.
DDM00003721	The joke's on you, "partners." You aren't getting to the prize without me.
DDM00003722	This is a fine how do you do.
DDM00003723	Should have blown up that seat cushion right when they sat down, would've been a better end than this.
DDM00003724	Just finish the last job, Dean. It's all you've wanted, just hang in there.
DDM00003725	Keep your head down, Dean, don't let the locals see you.
DDM00003726	Town's going to be filled with Ghosts when the sky lights up.
DDM00003727	This thing on my neck isn't for show. That bomb goes off, so do I - and you, too.
DDM00003728	Leaving me in that goddamn elevator in the dark? You'll beg me to do the same to you while the Holograms are tracing lasers across your face.
DDM00003729	So come on and get me, jackass. I'll have this floor's security dissect you like an Auto-Doc.
DDM00003730	So come on and get me, bitch. I'll have this floor's security dissect you like an Auto-Doc.
DDM00003731	Should be able to rewire them, failing that, shoot them, although that'll alert the others, they're on a linked patrol pattern.
DDM00003732	All doors are locked down, security's activated - and emitter signals are lighting up all over this floor. I'll do what I can from here.
DDM00003733	Why pipe not break. Pipe. Break. Hnh. Leave it, not important.
DDM00003734	Oh, looks like you already forced the gate. Now, everybody and their mother can walk right in, thanks.
DDM00003735	Don't have to take the long way back - there's a shortcut across the way, you see.
DDM00003736	It's through the Cloud - but if I'm with you, I can help you through it. If you didn't already force the lock to the gate, that is.
DDM00003737	<Lie> Dean, I wouldn't leave you here, I swear.
DDM00003738	Sure, nice words, nice promises... not worth a dime out here in the shadow of the Sierra Madre.
DDM00003739	You say you wouldn't leave me here, I know better. And you leave me here, this Gala Event isn't going to happen, I can feel it.
DDM00003740	I'm not going to let any harm come to you, all right?
DDM00003741	No... you're not the type, but accidents happen, good intentions or no.
DDM00003742	Really? That wasn't the "we're both bomb-married" talk you gave me when we first met.
DDM00003743	Look, you could offer me a steel clad contract for a world tour of all major cities with Imperial Records, I still wouldn't stay here.
DDM00003744	Less painful would be me throwing you off the roof. Understand?
DDM00003745	Pipe stay broken.
DDM00003746	Pipe needs to behave, or Dog will hurt pipe.
DDM00003747	All better. Pipe be good now, keep hissing.
DDM00003748	You sound like the woman in the Sierra Madre broadcast.
DDM00003749	Do I? It sounds off to my ears... hard to tell. Not to mention it... hurts like hell to swallow.
DDM00003750	Might be why I got moved off to this suite... it's hers. That's her over there, got trapped by security like I did. Just took a different way out.
DDM00003751	I wasn't the one hiding all this time.
DDM00003752	You sure needed it to escape.
DDM00003753	Proud that you have one? I can hear the superiority.
DDM00003754	What do you mean?
DDM00003755	That thing on your wrist - it's a convenience. It tells you where to go, what to do, dulls your brain.
DDM00003756	It may have helped you find the Sierra Madre broadcast, but it's just as much a crutch today as it was in the Old World.
DDM00003757	How did you access my Pip-Boy?
DDM00003758	You speak as if your fingers have never touched the keys of a RobCo terminal. No machine is foolproof, they are designed to obey us.
DDM00003759	The Pip-Boy's operating system has vulnerabilities... advantages to those who've studied its construction, even superficially.
DDM00003760	It's just a machine, though. Its real vulnerability is who wears it. And that's how you were caught.
DDM00003761	Still hiding behind images and screens, I see.
DDM00003762	Hiding? Hardly. Trapped.
DDM00003763	You think you were the first one to unlock the casino door? No, I did it... with other hands, other bodies. After that, the casino wouldn't let go.
DDM00003764	Once I was locked in, no way out... until your Pip-Boy signal came to life in the Villa. Then... then, uh, things changed. And here you are.
DDM00003765	You've got a lot to answer for.
DDM00003766	Do I? For what? Your greed? Curiosity? You came here on your own, no one held a gun to your head.
DDM00003767	I've seen your Pip-Boy archives, your map markers and notes - you picked up the Sierra Madre signal just as I did, you couldn't resist.
DDM00003768	So if you feel I have a lot to answer for... no, the blame isn't on my shoulders. Might as well have put the collar on yourself.
DDM00003769	There's a chance he'll see reason.
DDM00003770	Try and reason with him, see what happens. He's so lost in his technology, I don't think he even understands why anymore.
DDM00003771	Sympathized? Why?
DDM00003772	He said he understood what it meant to track someone who had such a... impact on his past life.
DDM00003773	He said people were like couriers, sometimes never understanding the messages they brought. That's who he was hunting for... some courier.
DDM00003774	He knew Elijah? How?
DDM00003775	No idea. A courier. Wore an Old World flag on his back. He was the one who pulled me out there, told me where Elijah had gone.
DDM00003776	Helped me heal up, listened to my story. He... sympathized.
DDM00003777	He said he knew you.
DDM00003778	He saw me, before the scars, at a place far from here. It's where he found some of the technology he uses now.
DDM00003779	It's a place called the Big Empty. The name's deceptive - if you know where to look.
DDM00003780	Almost got trapped there. There was someone else, though, who came along. Knew about Elijah.
DDM00003781	"Settle it?" You're here to kill him.
DDM00003782	Those are my orders. I've seen what he's done, and I believe in those orders.
DDM00003783	Sounds personal.
DDM00003784	He... cut me off from someone I cared about a long time ago. He used his status to break us apart. So I had to find a new purpose, same banner.
DDM00003785	Then he became unstable, left a trail of crimes across the wasteland. Once word reached us, I was ordered to kill him.
DDM00003786	How long have you been hunting him?
DDM00003787	Too long. Thought I might have had a chance to settle it before this event happened, but then the chance slipped away again.
DDM00003788	The elevator to the vault is here, too.
DDM00003789	The elevator to the casino vault is here. In the starlet's room? That seems intimate.
DDM00003790	Now that your voice is back, what did you want to say?
DDM00003791	Your voice... is that the Starlet's voice?
DDM00003792	Guess the Sierra Madre healed me. It doesn't matter, and to be honest, I miss my voice.
DDM00003793	I've had enough of you and Elijah running the show. Now it's my turn.
DDM00003794	People missing heads... make mistake coming here. Make Dog hungry.
DDM00003795	It looks like someone was experimenting... although they were doing so after the collars went off.
