CTM00000178	=Transfer [%] to the Mojave Brotherhood=
CTM00000179	[%] once belonged to the Brotherhood of Steel. Perhaps we should transfer the bunker back to them.
CTM00000180	Transfer the Bunker
CTM00000181	[%] is now under the control of the Mojave Brotherhood.
CTM00000182	Keep the Bunker
CTM00000183	[%] remains under the control of [%].
CTM00000184	The Brotherhood patrols that now march along I-95 need a place to rest and repair their power armor. We could offer them the old El Dorado Gas station as place for respite.
CTM00000185	[CRLF][CRLF] We can either transfer the entire outpost to the Brotherhood or just reinforce it with Paladins while still retaining control.
CTM00000186	[CRLF][CRLF] If you hand over the outpost, you can still use the supply crate located there.
CTM00000187	Transfer the Outpost
CTM00000188	Reinforce the Outpost
CTM00000189	Paladins and Knights have arrived at [%] to support our forces stationed there.
CTM00000190	Keep the Outpost
CTM00000191	Brotherhood patrols can be seen marching up and down the I-15 now that the Chapter is no longer in hiding. [%] would serve as good outpost for them, if we were willing to hand it over to them.
CTM00000192	[CRLF][CRLF] Instead of transfering the entire outpost, we could also simply reinforce it with Paladin while still retaining control.
CTM00000193	[CRLF][CRLF]If you hand over the outpost, you can still use the supply crate located there.
CTM00000194	[CRLF][CRLF]We can invite Scribes from the Brotherhood to help with repairing the radio equipment at the top of Black MT.[CRLF][CRLF]We could also simply transfer the entire facility to the Brotherhood and withdraw from the mountain.
CTM00000195	Invite the Brotherhood
CTM00000196	The Scribes and Paladins from Hidden Valley have arrived at [%].
CTM00000197	Transfer Control to the Brotherhood
CTM00000198	[%] is now under the control of the Brotherhood of Steel.
CTM00000199	[CRLF][CRLF](You do not have [%]!)
CTM00000200	Do Not Invite
CTM00000201	The Brotherhood is not invited. [%] remains under the sole control of [%].
CTM00000202	=Brotherhood Reinforcements to [%]=
CTM00000203	[CRLF][CRLF][%] sits at an important intersection in the Mojave. Power-armored reinforcements from the Brotherhood could help [%] hold the junction.[CRLF][CRLF]Alternatively, we could also transfer the outpost completely to the Brotherhood.
CTM00000204	Reinforce with Brotherhood Soldiers
CTM00000205	Brotherhood reinforcements arrived at [%].
CTM00000206	No Reinforcements
CTM00000207	[%] will be held soley by [%].
CTM00000208	[CRLF][CRLF]Many call the Brotherhood of Steel [%]tech fetishists[%], but it can't be denied that there are few more knowledgeable about technology than the descendants of Maxson.%r%rPerhaps their Scribes should be invited to the old Repconn Facility to assist in researching the PreWar rockets there.[CRLF][CRLF]Alternatively, we could also transfer complete control of the facility to the Brotherhood of Steel.
CTM00000209	The Brotherhood is not invited to assist in research. [%] remains under the sole control of [%].
CTM00000210	The Brotherhood has established patrols up and down the I-15. We could offer [%] to their Paladins to use as an outpost.
CTM00000211	[CRLF][CRLF]If you hand over the location, you can still use the supply crate located there.
CTM00000212	As more Big MT research facilities are secured, you can decide to transfer them to the Brotherhood of Steel.
CTM00000213	Transfer
CTM00000214	Keep
CTM00000215	[%] guards the road that leads to the complex where the Hidden Valley bunker is located. As a sign of goodwill, [%] could hand over the outpost to the Mojave Brotherhood.
CTM00000216	[%] can be transferred over to the Mojave Brotherhood so the Chapter might better assist [%] in patrolling the I-15.
CTM00000217	=Work with the Brotherhood to Big MT=
CTM00000218	=Invite the Brotherhood to Big MT=
CTM00000219	[CRLF][CRLF] Big MT holds many secrets, and Scribes from the Brotherhood could help in unlocking them.[CRLF][CRLF]But can the Brotherhood be trusted with the technological riches of Big MT?
CTM00000220	[CRLF][CRLF] The Brotherhood has fled the Mojave and found sanctuary in the Big Empty. Rather than fight them, maybe [%] should work with them to rebuild the research facility.
CTM00000221	Work with the Brotherhood
CTM00000222	Invite the Brotherhood
CTM00000223	Scribes and Paladins have arrived at [%].[CRLF][CRLF]You can further cooperate with the Brotherhood in Big MT as you continue to secure the area.
CTM00000224	The secrets of Big MT are for [%] only.
CTM00000225	=Treaty with the Mojave Brotherhood=
CTM00000226	[CRLF][CRLF]Despite years of animosity, the NCR and the Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel currently have a shaky, but holding, ceasefire. A formal treaty would allow for closer cooperation between Camp McCarran and Hidden Valley, but many in Shady Sands think the truce is already too much.
CTM00000227	The Brotherhood of Steel has reemerged from their isolation and has returned as a player in the Mojave. Despite their prickly nature, the Chapter could be a useful partner.[CRLF][CRLF]You know the Mojave Brotherhood better than anyone outside of Hidden Valley. Should [%] sign a treaty with the Brotherhood to formalize an alliance?
CTM00000228	Sign a Treaty
CTM00000229	The Mojave Brotherhood and [%] ratify a treaty of friendship. Further cooperation between the two is now possible.
CTM00000230	No Treaty
CTM00000231	The NCR-BoS ceasefire remains, but without a treaty.
CTM00000232	Relations between the Mojave Chapter and [%] remain cordial, but no treaty is signed.
CTM00000233	The former Viper's camp could be handed over to the Brotherhood to strengthen their presence on the I-95 and support of their newly formed patrols on the interstate.
CTM00000234	=Currency Exchange=
CTM00000235	[CRLF][CRLF]Crippled by the Brotherhood's attack on California's gold reserves and abandoned by greedy caravaneers, the NCR dollar is not as strong as it once was. As the almighty bottle cap resurges in popularity, even the military is having to rely on caps to fund operations in the Mojave."
CTM00000236	[CRLF][CRLF]In time, the whole wasteland will trade in Caesar's coinage and not in tin caps and scraps of paper. Until then, the Legion must use all economic resources at its disposal to conquer the Mojave.
CTM00000237	[CRLF][CRLF]Californian troopers gamble in Vegas with their paper dollars, while the Legion skips their gold and silver coins across the Colorado River. Caught between this war of currencies is the humble bottle cap, a mainstay of the wasteland economy.
CTM00000238	[CRLF][CRLF]To fund the investments, you can purchase a cash register for your commander's office that can be used to exchange currencies.
CTM00000239	A cash register has been added to the bookshelf next to your desk. You can use it to exchange currencies.
CTM00000240	=Transfer [%] to the Desert Rangers=
CTM00000241	[CRLF][CRLF]The Desert Rangers have been looking for a location to establish their new headquarters in the Mojave and have requested the old Searchlight Airport. They have no qualms about their headquarters being on the frontline with Caesar's Legion. If anything, that close proximity is why they want the airport.
CTM00000242	Transfer the Airport
CTM00000243	[%] is now under the control of the Desert Rangers.
CTM00000244	Keep the Airport
CTM00000245	[CRLF][CRLF]Following the successful revolt against the NCR, [%] can transfer the former Ranger stations to the Desert Rangers to shore up the front line against the Legion.
CTM00000246	=Send Desert Rangers to 
CTM00000247	[CRLF][CRLF]Desert Rangers have requested to be posted to Calville Bay to help defend the area from Legion raiding parties.[CRLF][CRLF]We can either simply reinforce the Bay with Desert Rangers or transfer the entire outpost to them.
CTM00000248	Transfer the Bay
CTM00000249	Desert Rangers have arrived at [%].
CTM00000250	Keep the Bay
CTM00000251	[CRLF][CRLF]We can send Desert Rangers to Cottonwood Cove to reinforce against Legion counterattacks. We could also transfer the entire base to the Desert Rangers if you so choose.
CTM00000252	Transfer the Base
CTM00000253	Reinforce the Base
CTM00000254	Keep the Base
CTM00000255	=Desert Rangers Revolt=
CTM00000256	[CRLF][CRLF]     The Desert Rangers have returned to liberate the Mojave, but many of our comrades continue to fight for the NCR. However, the rumors of Chief Hanlon betraying the Ranger Unification Treaty and trying to abandon the Mojave to the Legion slavers have angered many Rangers.
CTM00000257	[CRLF][CRLF]     With enough caps, [%] can exploit this unrest by covertly funding a revolt, recruiting Desert Rangers to fight for a free Mojave. Ranger Stations Alpha, Bravo, Delta, Echo, and Foxtrot will be captured by Rangers loyal to our cause, provided you do not already control these outposts.
CTM00000258	[CRLF][CRLF]     The Ranger Unification Treaty is a decade old and disillusionment with the Californian Dream runs deep among the Desert Rangers. Shady Sands promised to protect the Mojave and push back the Legion, but instead squanders taxes on the Strip while Caesar's armies grow unchecked.
CTM00000259	[CRLF][CRLF]     Chief Hanlon, once a symbol of wisdom and strength for Rangers, is now seen at best as apathetic to the plight of the Mojave. At worst, if recent rumors are to be believed, he is actively betraying the promises of the Ranger Unification Treaty.
CTM00000260	[CRLF][CRLF]     Chief Hanlon, once a symbol of wisdom and strength for Rangers, is now seen as a disgraced traitor. If the accusations leveled against him before his death were true, then he actively worked to betray the promises of the Ranger Unification Treaty.
CTM00000261	[CRLF][CRLF]     With enough caps, [%] can exploit this unrest by covertly funding a revolt, recruiting the Desert Rangers to fight for a free Mojave. Ranger Stations Alpha, Bravo, Delta, Echo, and Foxtrot will be captured by Desert Rangers loyal to our cause, provided you do not already control these outposts. If you do hold these outposts, you will have the option to transfer them to the Desert Rangers.
CTM00000262	 Funding the revolt will, of course, damage your reputation with the NCR.
CTM00000263	Fund the Revolt
CTM00000264	Desert Rangers along with a large number of Mojave-born Troopers have revolted against the NCR and defected to [%]. 
CTM00000265	The following Ranger Stations are now under Desert Ranger control:
CTM00000266	[%]     - Alpha
CTM00000267	[%]     - Bravo
CTM00000268	[%]     - Delta
CTM00000269	[%]     - Echo
CTM00000270	[%]     - Foxtrot
CTM00000271	[CRLF][CRLF]You don't have enough caps to fund the revolt at the moment.
CTM00000272	Do Not Fund the Revolt
CTM00000273	The Desert Rangers are discontent, but remain loyal to Shady Sands.
CTM00000274	[CRLF][CRLF]Legion slavers traverse Lake Mead to raid communities in the eastern Mojave. Stationing Desert Rangers on the old scavenger's platform could keep the waters secure.
CTM00000275	=Permit the Followers of the Apocalypse to Enter [%]=
CTM00000276	The Followers of the Apocalypse have requested permission to enter [%] to help care for the prisoners.[CRLF][CRLF]While their medical care would be benefical, it might be best to keep these bleeding-heart anarchists away from the prison.
CTM00000277	Permit the Followers
CTM00000278	Doctors from the Followers arrived at [%].
CTM00000279	Refuse the Followers
CTM00000280	The Followers will not be permitted to enter [%].
CTM00000281	=Send the Followers to the Cuckoo's Nest=
CTM00000282	[CRLF][CRLF]Since your arrival at Big MT, many of the so-called [%]Lobotomites[%] have been killed or, depending on who you ask, [%]put out of their misery.[%] Still, the Followers could be sent to the [%]Cuckoo's Nest[%], where many Lobotomites reside and attempt to help them.[CRLF][CRLF]Are the sad, mad souls worth saving?
CTM00000283	Send
CTM00000284	The Followers will go to the Cuckoo's Nest and try to save the Lobotomites.
CTM00000285	Do Not Send
CTM00000286	The Followers will not go to the Cuckoo's Nest.
CTM00000287	=Transfer [%] to the Followers of the Apocalypse=
CTM00000288	The Followers of the Apocalypse are known for their knowledge of agriculture almost as much as their skill in medicine. We should consider transferring some of our farms to the Followers and local farmers.
CTM00000289	[CRLF][CRLF]If you hand over the farm, you can still use the supply crate located there.
CTM00000290	Transfer the Farm
CTM00000291	[%] is now under the care of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
CTM00000292	Keep the Farm

CTM00000294	[CRLF][CRLF]The Followers may be interested in the medical technology found within the Y-17 Medical Facility. Should we invite some of their doctors to the facility? We would undoubtedly benefit from their expertise.
CTM00000295	Invite
CTM00000296	The Followers have arrived at [%].
CTM00000297	Do Not Invite
CTM00000298	The Followers are not invited to assist in research.
CTM00000299	=Send the Followers to Assist in Nightkin Research at Jacobstown=
CTM00000300	[CRLF][CRLF]Doctor Henry made great strides in discovering a cure for the Nightkin's schizophrenia. The Followers could help further his research even more.
CTM00000301	Doctors from the Followers arrived at Jacobstown to help with Nighkin research.
CTM00000302	The Followers will not assist in researching a cure.
CTM00000303	=Treaty with the Followers of the Apocalypse=
CTM00000304	[CRLF][CRLF]Relations between the NCR and the Followers of the Apocalypse may have worsened in the last few years, but the threat of Caesar's Legion reminds both factions of their common values.[CRLF][CRLF]Is it time to solidify an alliance between republicanism and anarchism with a treaty?
CTM00000305	[CRLF][CRLF]The Followers of the Apocalypse have agreed to support a cause that doesn't kneel to California or Arizona.[CRLF][CRLF]Could this support pave the way to a treaty with [%]?
CTM00000306	The Followers of the Apocalypse and [%] ratify a treaty of friendship. Further cooperation between the two is now possible.
CTM00000307	There will be no official treaty between the Followers of the Apocalypse and [%].
CTM00000308	=Invite the Followers of the Apocalypse to Big MT=
CTM00000309	[CRLF][CRLF]Most people would agree the test subjects of Big MT are beyond saving. Their minds have been twisted by mad science, and their humanity erased by unimaginable experiments. The Followers of the Apocalypse see them differently and want to help.
CTM00000310	[CRLF][CRLF]Should [%] allow the Followers to set up camp at the Little Yangtze?
CTM00000311	Rename the Camp
CTM00000312	The Followers will not be permitted to enter Big MT.
CTM00000313	=I-15 Patrol=
CTM00000314	[CRLF][CRLF]The majority of the I-15 is under the control of [%]. A squad should be detached to help fill in the gaps between our outposts.
CTM00000315	[CRLF][CRLF]The patrol route will run from [%] into the Vegas ruins.
CTM00000316	Establish Patrol
CTM00000317	Patrol route established.
CTM00000318	=I-95 Patrol=
CTM00000319	[CRLF][CRLF]I-95 is a valuable trade route that currently runs parallel to the frontlines drawn between the NCR and the Legion.[CRLF][CRLF]A patrol will be established that begins on the outskirts of Camp Searchlight and ends at the crossroads leading to the 188 Trading Post and Boulder City.
CTM00000320	=Destroy Jacobstown=
CTM00000321	[CRLF][CRLF]The leader of Jacobstown, Marcus, is dead, but Super Mutant stragglers remain. Rather than risk the mutants coming down the mountain, [%] should assault the ski lodge and exterminate the residents.
CTM00000322	Assault
CTM00000323	Jacobstown Garrison
CTM00000324	The remaining Super Mutants at Jacobstown have been wiped out by [%].
CTM00000325	Leave Jacobstown Alone
CTM00000326	Jacobstown has been left to slowly fade away on its own.
CTM00000327	=North Mojave Homesteads=
CTM00000328	[CRLF][CRLF]To the north of Vegas are rows of ruined farms and homes, abandoned due to the scourge of raiders that once plagued the area. Now that the Fiends are gone and much of that area is under the banner of [%], there is no reason for those farmlands to sit idle any longer. Homesteaders should be encouraged to settle and work the land.
CTM00000329	Homesteaders have moved into the abandoned farms in the northern Mojave.
CTM00000330	==Treaty with the NCR=
CTM00000331	[CRLF][CRLF]The NCR was pushed out of the Mojave, and the great city of Vegas is under the control of [%]. Nevertheless, Vegas would benefit from trade and healty relations with California.[CRLF][CRLF]Is it time to mend things with Shady Sands?
CTM00000332	Sign
CTM00000333	A fragile ceasefire with the NCR has been enacted.
CTM00000334	There will be no peace with the NCR.
CTM00000335	=Mr. House's Reconstruction Plan=
CTM00000336	[CRLF][CRLF]Mr. House left behind comprehensive plans for the rebuilding of Vegas after the Second Battle of Hoover Dam. While Mr. House might be no more, there is no reason not to enact his reconstruction plans.[CRLF][CRLF]Should there be enough caps in the budget, of course.
CTM00000337	Enact
CTM00000338	Reconstruction has begun.
CTM00000339	Reject Plans
CTM00000340	For better or for worse, New Vegas remains as it is.
CTM00000341	=Enclave Remnants=
CTM00000342	[CRLF][CRLF]The Enclave Remnants are planning to fight at Hoover Dam. Their advanced weaponry and power armor will play a large part in determining who stands victorious.
CTM00000343	[CRLF][CRLF]But do the Remnants deserve a glorious final battle, or should the Enclave war criminals be brought to justice in a Californian court of law? Perhaps they should be arrested now while they are gathered in one location.
CTM00000344	[CRLF][CRLF]But are heavily armed, albeit geriatric, war criminals worth the risk? Perhaps they should be arrested now while they are gathered in one location.
CTM00000345	Arrest the Remnants
CTM00000346	Some members died during the storming of their bunker, but most of the so called [%]Enclave Remnants[%] have been taken prisoner.
CTM00000347	Leave Them Alone
CTM00000348	The Remnants will continue to fight at the Dam as planned.
CTM00000349	== Mojave Investments ==

CTM00000353	[CRLF][CRLF]There are currently no Investments available.
CTM00000354	=Searchlight Airport=
CTM00000355	[CRLF][CRLF]The town of Searchlight may be an irradiated ghost town, but the adjacent airport stands in relatively good condition. Securing the airport will help strengthen the position of [%] along the Colorado River.
CTM00000356	Rename the Airport
CTM00000357	=Ranger Station Alpha=
CTM00000358	[CRLF][CRLF]We can send additional Rangers to the station to help reinforce it against potential Legion attack.
CTM00000359	[CRLF][CRLF]A detachment of Troopers will help reinforce the Ranger Station and free up Rangers for more scouting missions.
CTM00000360	[CRLF][CRLF]Ranger Station Alpha provides a good view of Lake Mead. It would be a good idea to secure and fortify the station for use by [%].
CTM00000361	Ranger Station Alpha has been reinforced.
CTM00000362	Rename the Station
CTM00000363	=Callville Bay=

CTM00000366	=Bonnie Springs=
CTM00000367	[CRLF][CRLF]The once quaint town of Bonnie Springs is a literal ruin of its former self, but [%] can start working towards rebuilding the settlement.
CTM00000368	Rename Bonnie Springs
CTM00000369	=Bradley's Shack=
CTM00000370	[CRLF][CRLF]Now that the Jackals are gone from the shack, [%] can send some [%]

CTM00000374	Rename the Shack
CTM00000375	=Ranger Station Bravo=
CTM00000376	Ranger Station Bravo is nestled in the hills north of Lake Mead. It would be a good idea to secure and fortify the station for use by [%].
CTM00000377	Ranger Station Bravo has been reinforced.
CTM00000378	=NCR Correctional Facility=
CTM00000379	The correctional facility is finally back in the hands of the NCR. It's time to clean up the mess the Powder Gangers left behind and reopen the ruined prison, this time with tighter security.
CTM00000380	The correctional facility is a mess and is long overdue for a cleanup. If the Powder Gangers going to be a main stay of the Mojave, we can't have our home base looking like a ruin.
CTM00000381	The profligates failed to keep the prisoners of the NCRCF under control so it is up to the Legion to clean up the bear's mess. Once the facility is rebuilt, it would serve well as a pen for slaves.
CTM00000382	With Powder Gangers gone, the NCR Correctional Facility is up for the taking. We should move in and secure the prison before the NCR does.
CTM00000383	Legion Slave
CTM00000384	Rename the Facility
CTM00000385	=Ranger Station Charlie=
CTM00000386	[CRLF][CRLF]The NCR cannot stand by and allow Ranger Station Charlie to sit in ruin. The Republic must stand defiant in the face of Legion barbarity and rebuild the station.
CTM00000387	[CRLF][CRLF]By right of conquest, the Ranger Station belongs to Caesar! A squad of legionaries will be sent to secure it.
CTM00000388	[CRLF][CRLF]After being razed by Legionaries, the Ranger Station is open for new occupants. Its strategic location should not go to waste.
CTM00000389	=Cottonwood Cove=
CTM00000390	The hour has come to bolster the defenses of Cottonwood Cove, making it into a formidable fortress for Caesar. Moreover, it is past time to bestow the camp with a Legion name.
CTM00000391	The Legion has been driven out of Cottonwood Cove. Before they have a chance to return, [%] must ensure the camp is secured to thwart any potential counterattacks from Caesar.
CTM00000392	=Ranger Station Delta=
CTM00000393	Ranger Station Delta watches over the Hoover Dam. It would be a good idea to secure and fortify the station for use by [%].
CTM00000394	Ranger Station Delta has been reinforced.
CTM00000395	=Abandoned BoS Bunker=
CTM00000396	[CRLF][CRLF]Whatever secrets the Sierra Madre holds, they must not fall into the hands of anyone other than [%].

CTM00000400	=Ranger Station Echo=

CTM00000402	Ranger Station Echo has been reinforced.
CTM00000403	=El Dorado Gas and Service=
CTM00000404	[CRLF][CRLF]The old gas station could serve as a strategic checkpoint for [%] along Highway 95.
CTM00000405	Rename the Checkpoint
CTM00000406	=Fields' Shack=
CTM00000407	[CRLF][CRLF]There is no need for the Boomers to rain artillery fire down any everyone who wanders to close to Nellis. If we establish an outpost in the old shack, we can at least warn people first. If they still insist on wandering into our line of fire, then it is on them.
CTM00000408	[CRLF][CRLF]Although isolationist, the Boomers are an incredibly dangerous faction with tremendous fire power. It would in the best interests of [%] to keep a close eye on them.[CRLF][CRLF]A couple of scouts can be sent to hold the abandoned shack located on the road to Nellis where they can keep a watchful eye on the Boomers.
CTM00000409	=Vault 3=
CTM00000410	[CRLF][CRLF]Without their leaders, the Fiends are disorganized and vulnerable to an attack from [%]. Once they are cleared out of South Vegas, [%] can begin repairing the ruins, restoring the Vault, and inviting wastelanders to settle in the area.
CTM00000411	South Vegas
CTM00000412	Rename Vault 3
CTM00000413	=Ranger Station Foxtrot=
CTM00000414	[CRLF][CRLF]Buried in the forests of Mount Charleston, Ranger Station Foxtrot was established to keep an eye on the Great Khans at Red Rock Canyon. It would be a good idea to secure and fortify the station for use by [%].
CTM00000415	Ranger Station Foxtrot has been reinforced.
CTM00000416	=Searchlight North Gold Mine=
CTM00000417	[CRLF][CRLF]Although currently filled with a nest feral ghouls created after the Legion's attack at Camp Searchlight, those ghouls could easily be evicted, and the mine made functional again.[CRLF][CRLF]Whether or not there is anything of value in the mines remains to be determined, but it couldn't hurt check.
CTM00000418	Rename the Mine
CTM00000419	Change to Ally
CTM00000420	Change to Neutral
CTM00000421	=Goodsprings=
CTM00000422	[CRLF][CRLF]Joe Cobb and his gand were a bunch of morons, and deserved to get put in the ground. You don't make caps from burning a town to the ground. The real money is made from getting them to pay you to protect them.
CTM00000423	[CRLF][CRLF]You and Joe Cobb sure gave those Goodsprings rednecks a good whipping. Time to formalize Powdger Ganger control over the town.
CTM00000424	[CRLF][CRLF]After a recent brush with Powder Gangers, the town of Goodsprings might be interested in protection from [%].[CRLF][CRLF]Along with protection, we could also help tend the crops at some of town's abandonded farms and can help secure the Goodspring Source wells.
CTM00000425	[CRLF][CRLF]The old gas station north of town can also be turned into an outpost for us.
CTM00000426	Name the Goodsprings Outpost
CTM00000427	=Camp Guardian=
CTM00000428	[CRLF][CRLF]Now that the Lakelurks have been taken care of, Camp Guardian can be finally constructed.
CTM00000429	[CRLF][CRLF]The NCR flag will fly over the peak once more!
CTM00000430	[CRLF][CRLF]But this time it will be the flag of [%] that is raised a top the peak.
CTM00000431	=Gypsum Train Yard=
CTM00000432	[CRLF][CRLF]The old quarry at the Gypsum Train Yard has long been abandoned by the Mojave due to the Death Claws that made their nest there. Now that they are gone, the quarry can be reopened.
CTM00000433	=Harper's Shack=
CTM00000434	[CRLF][CRLF]Abandoned shacks are a common sight in the Mojave as tenants come and go like tumbleweeds. This shack in particular would serve as a valuable outlook post, and [%] might want to consider sending a few[%]
CTM00000435	[%]to occupy the shack.
CTM00000436	Rename the Shack
CTM00000437	=Nevada Highway Patrol Station=
CTM00000438	[CRLF][CRLF]The station is currently being used by Jackal gang members to harrass travelers on the I-15, but they can easily be dealt with.[CRLF][CRLF]Once the station is occupied, [%] will be able to keep a close eye on traffic moving in and out of the Mojave Outpost.
CTM00000439	=Horowitz Farmstead=
CTM00000440	[CRLF][CRLF]The large fields of the abandoned farm sit unused and its large barns house raiders and other creatures. Without a doubt, [%] would put the farm to better use than a gang of Vipers.
CTM00000441	Rename the Ranch
CTM00000442	=Hunter's Farm=
CTM00000443	[CRLF][CRLF] Now that the gecko attacks have stopped, the Powder Gangers can start working the fields at the farm, whether the lazy bastards want to or not. There are a lot of hungry mouths to feed at the NCRCF.
CTM00000444	[CRLF][CRLF] With both the geckos and the Powder Gangers evicted from the farm, [%] can seize the farm and start planting crops.
CTM00000445	Rename the Farm
CTM00000446	=Junction 15 Railway Station=
CTM00000447	[CRLF][CRLF]The old Junction 15 Railway Station sits at an important intersection that leads into the heart of Vegas. A team should be sent to secure the intersection for [%].
CTM00000448	=Jacobstown=
CTM00000449	[CRLF][CRLF]As a result of your favorable relationship with the super mutant settlement, [%] can reach out to establish formal ties with Jacobstown. A small-scale diplomatic outpost, doubling as a hub for visiting merchants, could be developed.
CTM00000450	Jacobstown Trading Post
CTM00000451	A small garrison and trading post has been established in Jacobstown by [%].
CTM00000452	=Jean Sky Diving=
CTM00000453	[CRLF][CRLF]The Powder Gangers can be doing more to secure our hold along I-15 and Jean Sky Diving is the perfect spot for jumping unsuspecting caravans.
CTM00000454	[CRLF][CRLF]In order to surpress Powder Ganger activity in the area, [%] can take over Jean Sky Diving and turn it into a checkpoint along I-15.
CTM00000455	=Lone Wolf Radio=
CTM00000456	[CRLF][CRLF]This rusted mobile home is full of valuable radio equipment. It would not take much work to convert the equipment for use by [%].
CTM00000457	=Matthews Animal Husbandry Farm=
CTM00000458	[CRLF][CRLF]Abandoned after the Legion's attack on Camp Searchlight, the farm's cattle have since been left unattended and are severly malnourished. For the good of the animals and to make sure their valuable meat and leather aren't left for the vultures, [%] should rebuild the farm.
CTM00000459	=Smith Mesa Prospector Camp=
CTM00000460	[CRLF][CRLF]It would not take much work to turn this abandonded prospector's camp into a listening post for [%]. The more eyes we have on the Colorado River, the better.
CTM00000461	[CRLF][CRLF]Plus someone should be sent to take care of the dog.
CTM00000462	=Mole Rat Ranch=
CTM00000463	[CRLF][CRLF]The domestication of Mole Rats is a tricky business, given how ornery the large rodents can be, but the fresh supply of meat could be sold to nearby Freeside for a nice profit.
CTM00000464	Rename the Raanch
CTM00000465	=Monte Cristo Suites=
CTM00000466	[CRLF][CRLF]The old apartment complex is in a ruined state and currently full of squatters and other vagrants. Despite its poor condition, [%] could find use for the old building as a garrison in the Vegas ruins.
CTM00000467	Rename the Suites
CTM00000468	=Nellis Air Force Base=
CTM00000469	[CRLF][CRLF]As the Boomers slowly begin to engage with the outside world, the tribe must be careful with who it allows onto its lands. That being said, a small trade post for caravaneers can be established near the entrance to the base.
CTM00000470	[CRLF][CRLF]The Boomers are slowly starting to emerge from isolation. Therefore, [%] should establish an embassy at Nellis Air Force Base to further develop relations with the tribe.
CTM00000471	Nellis Trade Post
CTM00000472	A trade post has been established at the Nellis Air Force Base
CTM00000473	A embassy has been established at the Nellis Air Force Base by [%].
CTM00000474	=Nipton=
CTM00000475	[CRLF][CRLF]Nipton burned as a lesson to the Mojave and demonstrated that the Legion will not tolerate degeneracy.[CRLF][CRLF]But now it is time for Caesar's second lesson. It is time to show the people of the Mojave that the Legion does not just raze villages. It rebuilds them, making them better than they were before.
CTM00000476	[CRLF][CRLF]After the horror inflicted upon Nipton by the Legion, it is up to [%] rebuild the town and defend it from future attacks.
CTM00000477	Rename Nipton
CTM00000478	=Powder Ganger Camp East=
CTM00000479	[CRLF][CRLF]This small camp has kept an eye on the rear of the NCRCF. We should reinforce to make sure no one sneaks up on us.
CTM00000480	[CRLF][CRLF]To keep the area surronding [%] under control, [%] should secure the Powder Ganger camp.
CTM00000481	=Powder Ganger Camp North=
CTM00000482	[CRLF][CRLF]The camp has been a good spot for ambushing caravans and sending the boys there some extra resources will help bring in more loot.
CTM00000483	[CRLF][CRLF]The Powder Gangers camped north of the NCRCF have been ambushing caravans for too long. Their banditry can no longer be tolerated.
CTM00000484	=Powder Ganger Camp South=
CTM00000485	[CRLF][CRLF]Since Chavez's little gang has been dealt with, the Powder Gangers should send someone to keep an eye on the railroad tracks.
CTM00000486	[CRLF][CRLF]The small camp would prove to be a useful outpost for keeping watch for traffic that might be moving on the railroad tracks.
CTM00000487	=Powder Ganger Camp West=
CTM00000488	[CRLF][CRLF]The NCR likes to set up so called [%]toll booths[%] in their territory. There's no reason the Powder Gangers can't do the same thing.
CTM00000489	[CRLF][CRLF]The old Powder Ganger Camp would serve well as a check point on I-15, and [%] could even set up a toll booth at the location.
CTM00000490	=Prospector's Den=
CTM00000491	[CRLF][CRLF]With the Jackals dead, the Prospectors have returned to the Den. They may be interested in protection from [%] to prevent future gang attacks.
CTM00000492	Rename the Den
CTM00000493	=Legion Raid Camp=
CTM00000494	It's imperative that the Legion fortify the raiding camp if we are to continue to strike against the profligates.
CTM00000495	Now that raiding camp has been destroyed, [%] should secure it to hold that area against future Legion incursions.
CTM00000496	=Emergency Service Railyard=
CTM00000497	[CRLF][CRLF]Smugglers and bandits often avoid the main roads and prefer to travel the Mojave by following the many intersecting railway lines. It may be a good idea to establish a checkpoint at the old Emergency Railyard Station.
CTM00000498	=Raul's Shack=
CTM00000499	[CRLF][CRLF]With the owner of the shack dead, you can seize it for [%]. It would serve well as a reconnaissance outpost.
CTM00000500	[CRLF][CRLF]Grateful to you for freeing him from Tabitha, Raul has agreed to allow [%] to station a scout at his shack to keep watch over the road.
CTM00000501	 Furthermore, he would appreciate it if someone could look after his brahmin calf if he leaves to travel with you.
CTM00000502	=REPCONN Test Site=
CTM00000503	[CRLF][CRLF]Now that the unusual situation at the REPCONN Test Site has come to an end, the facility should be occupied by [%] for security and research purposes.
CTM00000504	Rename the Facility
CTM00000505	=Raided Farmstead=
CTM00000506	[CRLF][CRLF]With the former residents most likely killed by bandits, there is no need for this farm's crops to go to waste, no matter how small the yield might be.
CTM00000507	Rebuilt Farmstead
CTM00000508	=Nipton Road Pit Stop=
CTM00000509	[CRLF][CRLF]The old ruins are often used by raiders to ambush travelling caravans. A small squad should be sent to secure the ruins and keep the roads safe.
CTM00000510	Rename the Pit Stop
CTM00000511	=Scavenger Platform=
CTM00000512	[CRLF][CRLF]The platform offers a good view of Lake Mead. Some scouts should be sent to hold it and set up an observation post.
CTM00000513	Rename the Platform
CTM00000514	=Silver Peak Mine=
CTM00000515	[CRLF][CRLF]The large Silver Peak Mine is infested by cazadors. Even if there are no precious ores to be found, the cave should regardless be cleared of the ferocious insects.
CTM00000516	Rename the Mine
CTM00000517	=Sloan=
CTM00000518	[CRLF][CRLF]The Death Claws in Quarry Junction might have been exterminated, but the Mojave remains a dangerous place. Reinforcements to Sloan are long overdue. California must remind the miners that she has not forsaken them.
CTM00000519	[CRLF][CRLF]After the Death Claw infestation at Quarry Junction, the NCR seemingly abandoned Sloan. Now, [%] can move into the town and reopen the quarry.
CTM00000520	Rename Quarry Junction
CTM00000521	=Sniper's Nest=
CTM00000522	[CRLF][CRLF]This abandoned Sniper's Nest offers a perfect view of the Colorado river and the surronding valley. It would be in the best interest of [%] to send a couple scouts to keep a close eye on the river.
CTM00000523	=Spring Mt. Ranch State Park=
CTM00000524	[CRLF][CRLF]The Great Khans must expand beyond Red Rock Canyon, and the nearby park provides fertile ground for our people to grow crops and raise Big Horners.
CTM00000525	[CRLF][CRLF]Despite how close the park is to the Great Khans, the fertile land should be claimed by [%]. The nearby garrison at [%] can ward off any would-be raider attacks.
CTM00000526	Rename the Park
CTM00000527	=New Vegas Steel=
CTM00000528	[CRLF][CRLF]The New Vegas Steel Mill remains in surprisingly good condition. Although deep in Fiend territory, it should be secured for [%] as the steel would prove invaluable.
CTM00000529	Rename the Mill
CTM00000530	=Nipton Road Reststop=
CTM00000531	[CRLF][CRLF]With the Radscorpions dealt with, [%] can establish a small checkpoint at the reststop.
CTM00000532	[CRLF][CRLF]We could also invite a trader to reopen the general store to sell to travelers on I-15.

CTM00000534	=H&H Tools Factory=
CTM00000535	[CRLF][CRLF]While Mr. House has no more need for H&H Tools than he did 200 years ago, it would be a shame to let the old family business deteriorate any further.
CTM00000536	[CRLF][CRLF]With the traps disarmed and the water drained, [%] can get to work rebuilding the old factory. What's more, the building will serve as an important outpost in North Vegas.
CTM00000537	=Tribal Village=
CTM00000538	[CRLF][CRLF]This small assortment of tents has had several owners, from tribals to Fiends to Khans to now a nest of Cazadors.[CRLF][CRLF]Once the pest are dealt with and the mess cleaned up, it could serve as a encampment for [%].

CTM00000550	=Southern Nevada Wind Farm=
CTM00000551	[CRLF][CRLF]In a very literal sense, power is the prize of the Mojave. While the energy outpost of this small wind farm is almost nothing compared to Helios One or the Hoover Dam, it is still another valuable source of power that should be secured by [%].

CTM00000557	[CRLF][CRLF]After years of disarray, it is time to set things straight in the Big MT, starting with of course, the Think Tank Dome.
CTM00000558	[CRLF][CRLF]Although extremely dangerous, the Big MT Research Facility is a treasure trove of advanced technology and Pre-War secrets.[CRLF][CRLF]An expedition should be organized and sent to explore the facility.
CTM00000559	[CRLF][CRLF]The first step towards planting the flag of [%] in the Big Empty is by securing the Think Tank Dome located in the middle of research facility.

CTM00000566	[CRLF][CRLF]The X-7 test site is full of neglected munitions. If we don't secure the area, those explosives could destroy the entirety of Big MT.
CTM00000567	Rename the X-7a Test Site
CTM00000568	=Z-14 Pepsinae DNA Splicing Lab=
CTM00000569	[CRLF][CRLF]Given how dangerous and destructive Cazadors are, it is no surprise they originated in Big MT.[CRLF][CRLF]If [%] can study the labs in which they were created, hopefully we can learn how to curb their population.

CTM00000583	[CRLF][CRLF]Saturnite is a curious, yet advanced alloy found in Big MT.
CTM00000584	[CRLF][CRLF]While most would look at Saturnite as a resource for weapon production, the Followers will find a better use for the metal.
CTM00000585	[CRLF][CRLF]We should study Saturnite as it could give [%] an edge in weapons production.
CTM00000586	=Securitron De-Construction Plant=
CTM00000587	[CRLF][CRLF]The Think Tank's attempt to understanding Mister House's securitron technology would be flattering if it wasn't such a utter failure.[CRLF][CRLF]We will put the facility to much better use.

CTM00000591	[CRLF][CRLF]The stealth technology at the X-13 Facility could prove very useful to [%].[CRLF][CRLF]A team of scientist should be sent to study the stealth suits and Nightstalkers.
CTM00000592	=The Think Tank=
CTM00000593	[CRLF][CRLF]We can't rebuild the Big Empty without first starting with the heart of the research facility, the Think Tank Dome.
CTM00000594	[CRLF][CRLF]With the Think Tank scientists dead, 
CTM00000595	[CRLF][CRLF]Whether the Think Tank researchers like or not, 
CTM00000596	it is a good idea to bring fresh minds with new ideas. After 200 years, its about time that a new generation of scientist got the opportunity to take over the reigns at the Big MT.
CTM00000597	 The promise of working with such advanced technology should make it easy to find scientists willing to work with us.
CTM00000598	[CRLF][CRLF]At center of the Big MT Research Facility is the Dome, home to the Think Tank. It is logical for this massive building to house our forward operating base in the Big Empty. 
CTM00000599	With the crazed scientist of the Think Tank deceased, 
CTM00000600	Given your friendship with the [%]scientists[%] of the Think Tank, 
CTM00000601	[%] should be able to move into the dome without any issues.
CTM00000602	[CRLF][CRLF]Specialists will be sent to Big MT and, in performance of their sacred duties, will study the technology of the research facility. Since the Brotherhood's founding, Elder Maxson has tasked us with safeguarding humanity from the dangers of unbridled scientific experimentation.[CRLF][CRLF]Now the Outcast will continue that mission.
CTM00000603	[CRLF][CRLF]The hologram army of [%] will cover Big MT and work towards unlock the secrets of the Big Emtpy.
CTM00000604	[CRLF][CRLF]Big MT serves as a testament to mankind's arrogance. Humans had their chance to play with science and it ended in disaster. Now it is our turn. Now the fruits of science belong to [%].
CTM00000605	[CRLF][CRLF]The top minds of the NCR's Office of Science and Industry will be called to help unlock the secrets of the Big MT for the good of the Republic.
CTM00000606	[CRLF][CRLF]While it is true that most of Caesar's domain is home to dimwitted tribals ill-equipped to study the Big Empty, many scientists and other educated folk have also found themselves wearing the Legion's slave collars. They will use their minds in the service of Caesar or face crucifixion.
CTM00000607	[CRLF][CRLF]While a brilliant scholar in his own right, Mister House has always been a patron of the sciences and that remains true to this day. Using the vast wealth of Vegas, Mister House will hire the brightest minds of the wasteland to study mysteries of the Big MT.
CTM00000608	[CRLF][CRLF]Scribes will be sent to Big MT and, in performance of their sacred duties, will study the technology of the research facility. Since the Brotherhood's founding, Elder Maxson has tasked us with safeguarding humanity from the dangers of unbridled scientific experimentation.[CRLF][CRLF]The Big MT may be the Brotherhood's greatest undertaking yet.
CTM00000609	[CRLF][CRLF]Most of the technology at the Big MT was created to destroy and to harm. Still, there may be research that could help lift the wasteland up. The Followers of the Apocalypse will send its brightest minds to the research facility to develop technology for that will lift humanity up rather than lead it to ruin.
CTM00000610	[CRLF][CRLF]The technology of the Big MT could be instrumental in rebuilding America. The greatest minds of the Enclave will be sent to uncover its secrets. The nation depends on it!
CTM00000611	[CRLF][CRLF]It is true most Super Mutants are, to put it bluntly, not the sharpest when it comes to matters of science. Nevertheless, we have [%]invited[%] many scientists and [%]convinced[%] them to work with us on unlocking the secrets of the Big Empty.
CTM00000612	[CRLF][CRLF]The disastrous state of the Big MT Research Facility is due mainly to the fallibility of humans. Luckily for the [%], robots do not suffer from the same faults as mankind. The unflinching logic of machines is just what is needed to unlock the Big MT's secrets.
CTM00000613	[CRLF][CRLF]Most of our expertise lies in explosives and arial technology, but our educated scientist at Nellis will have a better luck understanding the secrets of the Big Empty than the barbarians of the uncivilized wasteland.
CTM00000614	[CRLF][CRLF]In order to unlock the secrets of the Big MT, [%] will need to employ a large number of scientists. Luckily, the promise of working with such advanced technology should make it easy to find scientists willing to work with us.
