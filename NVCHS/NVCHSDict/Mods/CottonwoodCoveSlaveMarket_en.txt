CCS00000002	Be Vigilant
CCS00000003	Raiding parties leaving Cottonwood Cove are advised to remain vigilant for a priority target spotted by the Explorer Quintus Aulus while on routine patrol. The target is described as a one-eyed man in his 30s with a severely burn-scarred face. This target has been known to harass patrols and set up ambushes. Quintus vowed to track the target last claiming he was moving north further into profligate lands and has not yet returned or been located by a recent search party.[CRLF][CRLF]Quintus is a veteran scout with distinguished service in several campaigns. It is worriesome that there has been no word for this long. The target is assumed to be dangerous (possible Ex-Desert Ranger), possessing military training and survivablilty skils. Target is not to be approached alone. News of the targets death or capture shall be reported to Aurelius of Pheonix at once.
CCS00000004	Patrol routes are to be updated to cover the overlook and nearby ridges. The incident when the pregnant capture was shot through the head by a still unkown profligate was not only a regrettable loss, but amateurish. Get men watching those vantage points! We cannot allow for profligate marksmen to harass our position here. Should an incident of this caliber occur again, I shalll order decimatio for all who work the auction![CRLF][CRLF]Aurelius of Phoenix
