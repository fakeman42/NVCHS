TTW00000192	Tamper with that, and we're going to have a problem.
TTW00000193	I really hope you're not thinking of breaking into there.
TTW00000194	It's locked for a reason. Don't get any ideas.
TTW00000195	Don't even think of breaking into that.
TTW00000196	That's secure for a reason.
TTW00000197	That's not yours.
TTW00000198	I don't think you should mess with that.
TTW00000199	PLAYER PICKPOCKET
TTW00000200	Don't even think about it.
TTW00000201	What do you think you're doing?
TTW00000202	I'm watching you.
TTW00000203	Keep your hands to yourself.
TTW00000204	You won't get away with that.
TTW00000205	Not a good idea.
TTW00000206	What the hell do you think you're doing?
TTW00000207	What do you think you're doing?
TTW00000208	Don't touch me.
TTW00000209	GREETING
TTW00000210	Hurry and seal that hole from the attic! If you don't have any grenades then see if there's something nearby you can shoot that will explode!
TTW00000211	So. You're the genius who disarmed the bomb. Weeks of waiting and watching, ruined!
TTW00000212	It's a pity you acted so hastily. In the future, best sleep with one eye open.
TTW00000213	Yeah, you're pretty busted up, but you'll live. Stop by the clinic in the morning.
TTW00000214	Thanks for helping us, mungo. You're not so bad for a mungo.
TTW00000215	We're going home now. You watch out, okay?
TTW00000216	Man, that sure was something. You're pretty brave, mungo!
TTW00000217	We can make it from here, no problem. But you watch your back. Those Slaver assholes aren't going to forget about you.
TTW00000218	Thanks for getting us out of there, mungo. We're gonna head back home now.
TTW00000219	I'd think twice about coming back here if I were you. These guys aren't going to forget you, y'know?
TTW00000220	We'll meet you outside, if you can make it!
TTW00000221	We'll meet you outside, if you can make it!
TTW00000222	We'll meet you outside, if you can make it!
TTW00000223	Oh geez, mungo! This is crazy!
TTW00000224	We're gonna run for it. You come meet us outside if you make it!
TTW00000225	Man, what a mess! Don't get yourself killed, mungo!
TTW00000226	I already shorted out the fence system so our collars won't blow. I bet they won't even notice.
TTW00000227	We're getting outta here!
TTW00000228	You got the gate, huh? Okay, we're outta here!
TTW00000229	Shoot a couple of those mungo ass-bag Slavers for me, will ya?
TTW00000230	Man, you've made a mess. Go get 'em, mungo! Get that key!
TTW00000231	I guess you decided to do this your own way, huh?
TTW00000232	Well, now you've really done it. They're gonna kill you if they can, so you better kill them all first.
TTW00000233	Get the key for the slave pen gate off of the boss mungo, or that Forty asshole. If you can unlock the gate, we'll make a run for it.
TTW00000234	Oh man, they're gonna be mad at you! These Slaver guys are mean!
TTW00000235	You gonna help, or what? Squirrel and Penny are still in there.
TTW00000236	Well, I guess that's it. Thanks for getting us out of there, mungo.
TTW00000237	We're going back home now. You ever come out that way, you stop and say hi. I'll tell Mayor not to shoot you okay?
TTW00000238	Well, I guess that's it. Thanks for getting us out of there, mungo.
TTW00000239	We're going back home now. You ever come out that way, you stop and say hi. I'll tell Mayor not to shoot you okay?
TTW00000240	Not bad, mungo. Not bad at all.
TTW00000241	I told you I had a good plan. It sure worked, didn't it? You ever need anything, you go see MacCready in Lamplight. He'll help you out.
TTW00000242	Thanks, mungo.
TTW00000243	Thanks for getting us out of there. If you ever need anything, you come see us.
TTW00000244	Mayor will be nice to you. I'll make sure of it.
TTW00000245	So you got us out of there, huh?
TTW00000246	Not so bad for a mungo, I guess.
TTW00000247	So, uhh. Thanks and stuff. We're gonna head home soon.
TTW00000248	Is Rory safe yet?
TTW00000249	Get outta here! They see me talking to you, I'm dead!
TTW00000250	You did it! You disarmed that thing!
TTW00000251	Oh, and talk to Moira at Craterside Supply. She can help you decorate the place.
TTW00000252	My dad told me about how you're going to disarm the bomb. He gave me some stuff for you for when you get it done...
TTW00000253	You will come to regret your actions.
TTW00000254	Not now!
TTW00000255	I'll be damned! You did it, didn't you? You disarmed that thing!
TTW00000256	Hell, where's my manners? I'm Lucas Simms, mayor and sheriff. And I'm pleased to say, we've had a reward for fixing up that bomb. Here you go!
TTW00000257	Y'know, we could use someone like you living in town. We've got an empty place up behind the Brass Lantern. Here's the key and deed.
TTW00000258	And heck, Moira over at Craterside Supply can even sell you stuff to help fix the place up.
TTW00000259	Name's Lucas Simms, town sheriff. And mayor too, when the need arises.
TTW00000260	You got a weird look about you, boy. The kind that means trouble. I give everyone a fair shake. But if you do anything remotely stupid, you're dead.
TTW00000261	Name's Lucas Simms, town sheriff. And mayor too, when the need arises.
TTW00000262	Name's Lucas Simms, town sheriff. And mayor too, when the need arises.
TTW00000263	I don't know why, but I like you, boy! Something tells me you're all right. So welcome to Megaton! Just holler if you need something.
TTW00000264	Name's Lucas Simms, town sheriff. And mayor too, when the need arises.
TTW00000265	I don't know why, but I like you, girl! Something tells me you're all right. So welcome to Megaton! Just holler if you need something.
TTW00000266	Name's Lucas Simms, town sheriff. And mayor too, when the need arises.
TTW00000267	I must be getting slow in my old age. Thanks for saving my hide, there.
TTW00000268	Haven't disarmed the bomb yet? That's some serious Pre-War hardware. So go easy, okay?
TTW00000269	You there. Hold it. Who the hell are you?
TTW00000270	Ho chum! What's the word?
TTW00000271	You're brave to keep bothering me. Or stupid.
TTW00000272	Nice party.
TTW00000273	Happy birthday!
TTW00000274	Enjoying yourself?
TTW00000275	Good work! That's one less Radroach to deal with.
TTW00000276	Let's get a picture together. Capture the moment.
TTW00000277	President Rosie? What's happening around here anyway?
TTW00000278	Well, now. President Bob. How do you like that? Boy, things are gonna change around here. First step: get rid of all this "Dave" shit.
TTW00000279	The Kingdom of Bob! Or maybe Bobtopia! I'll have to give it some thought.
TTW00000280	Take whatever you want out of there. Consider it a gift from your kind and loving President Bob.
TTW00000281	Maybe we need a flag? One with my picture on it. That could be pretty cool.
TTW00000282	Maybe we need a flag? One with my picture on it. That could be pretty cool.
TTW00000283	First things first, we're gonna have to open up the Museum of Bob.
TTW00000284	Down with Ashur!
TTW00000285	Kill the taskmasters!
TTW00000286	Go away! They'll see us!
TTW00000287	HAHA! I love it. Another slave wandered back here, huh? What's wrong, couldn't get over the bridge? You're lucky I don't fuckin' paste you.
TTW00000288	Now would you look at this? Where'd you get all this shit anyway? Whatever. Mine now. Thanks, Scab! I hit the jackpot today!
TTW00000289	Now get back in there and get to work, or next time I'll just stake you out there for the Trogs.
TTW00000290	...
TTW00000291	You do actually know how to plant mines, right?
TTW00000292	The robots are over in the junkyard, in case you're wondering.
TTW00000293	Are you going to show us how to fix the robots?
TTW00000294	So are you going to ever show us how to be sneaky so we can hide from the Super Mutants?
TTW00000295	I'm getting bored. I thought you were going to teach us something.
TTW00000296	Go on, I'm watching. Show us what to do.
TTW00000297	I'm confused. What am I supposed to be doing? Can you show me?
TTW00000298	We're all watching you waiting to learn something. Well. Get on with it already!
TTW00000299	Go on. I'm paying attention. Show us what to do.
TTW00000300	Well, hotshot. Are you going to teach us something, or just stand there looking stupid?
TTW00000301	Oooh. I can't wait. Show us what to do!
TTW00000302	I'm watching. Go on. Teach us what to do.
TTW00000303	Go away.
TTW00000304	Impressive, slave. I guess I shouldn't call you that anymore.
TTW00000305	Not bad. Welcome to the club.
TTW00000306	Hey! Is that you?
TTW00000307	No time to talk to your type, local.
TTW00000308	Why don't you go bother the Brotherhood or something?
TTW00000309	Hey local, shouldn't you be banging rocks together, or something?
TTW00000310	Don't push your luck out here.
TTW00000311	Keep an eye out for those locals.
TTW00000312	Expulsion Protocol KL-001 in effect. Disengage voice parameters.
TTW00000313	Yes, fellow employee? What can I do for you on this wonderful day?
TTW00000314	Hello there, fellow employee. I don't believe we've met. I'm your Factory Foreman, Milo. It's a pleasure to meet you.
TTW00000315	Please give me your job posting title and employee registration number for my permanent records.
TTW00000316	Hello again, fellow employee. I still have no record of your posting or employee identification.
TTW00000317	Please give me your job posting title and employee registration number for my permanent records.
TTW00000318	What do you want now? Come to make fun of me again?
TTW00000319	What is it? Can't you see that I'm watching the guards?
TTW00000320	Whoa!!! Is it me, or is the world spinning?
TTW00000321	Who are you again?
TTW00000322	Oh, baby! Let me get you something special. How about a Dukov surprise? Hah ha!
TTW00000323	Never mind. You need a drink. Cherry! Need some fucking booze over here!
TTW00000324	Hello sweet cheeks! What can old Dukov do for you?
TTW00000325	Never mind. You need a drink. Cherry! I'm thirsty over here!
TTW00000326	Have you seen Cherry? I think the bitch ran out on me.
TTW00000327	Who the hell are you?
TTW00000328	Never mind. You need a drink. Cherry! I'm thirsty over here!
TTW00000329	Who the hell are you?
TTW00000330	Never mind. You need a drink. Fantasia! I'm thirsty over here!
TTW00000331	Who the hell are you?
TTW00000332	Never mind. You need a drink. My women are gone, so help yourself.
TTW00000333	Whatcha need? How about a drink? No? Suit yourself.
TTW00000334	Yeah, yeah, you're my hero. Don't let it go to your head. Seriously though, thank you for getting me away from Dukov.
TTW00000335	So that prick Dukov is dead. Can't say I'll miss him.
TTW00000336	Even so, I'm going to need someone to protect me. A girl can't survive by herself in the Wasteland.
TTW00000337	Hey, good looking. I'm Cherry. Can I do anything for you?
TTW00000338	Hi, sweetie. I'm Cherry. What can I do for you?
TTW00000339	Hi, sugar. I'm Cherry. Do yourself a favor. Watch yourself with Dukov. He's all hands.
TTW00000340	Yeah?
TTW00000341	He's dead! I'm going to miss the old lecher. We had some real fun times.
TTW00000342	Who's going to look after me now?
TTW00000343	Hey, I've been wanting to talk to you. Leo told me what you said to him. You know, about his problem.
TTW00000344	I just wanted to say thank you. I know I can be rough, but my little brother means the world to me and you may have saved his life.
TTW00000345	If there's anything that I can ever help you with, just let me know.
TTW00000346	Hey there, Leo's been doing a lot better. I think we have you to thank for that. How can I help you?
TTW00000347	Leo's tickets have stopped coming up short ever since he gave up the chems. Me and my wallet both thank you. What can we do for you?
TTW00000348	Can't a man eat in peace? Go talk to Jenny or Leo if you need something.
TTW00000349	Look, I need to balance these books. If you'd like to order some food, please talk to Jenny or Leo.
TTW00000350	Yep. Still balancing the books. Is there something exciting about watching me? Look: Go talk to Jenny or Leo.
TTW00000351	You again. Is there something exciting about watching me? Look: Go talk to Jenny or Leo.
TTW00000352	Hmm? Oh. I'm afraid I'm quite busy right now. If it's food you're after, talk to Jenny or Leo. Otherwise, I can't help you.
TTW00000353	You again? Go Bother Jenny or Leo, will you?
TTW00000354	Hooo weee! Look at you! Now I haven't seen one of those Vault jumpsuits in, wow, a LONG time. Pretty damn good condition, too!
TTW00000355	Name's Billy Creel. You call me Billy, all right? I know Megaton looks more like a boneyard than a town, but it ain't all bad.
TTW00000356	Take me and Maggie, for instance. We make do just fine. I trade the stuff I scavenge, and she helps keep me on the straight and narrow. He he he.
TTW00000357	Well hot damn! Someone new! Always a pleasure!
TTW00000358	Name's Billy Creel. You call me Billy, all right? I know Megaton looks more like a boneyard than a town, but it ain't all bad.
TTW00000359	Take me and Maggie, for instance. We make do just fine. I trade the stuff I scavenge, and she helps keep me on the straight and narrow. He he he.
TTW00000360	Look, bud. It'd be best if you just drift on by and leave us alone.
TTW00000361	Heard some more people got attacked last night.
TTW00000362	Yeah?
TTW00000363	Hey there.
TTW00000364	I'm not looking for trouble, or conversation either.
TTW00000365	I've got nothing to say to you. Best move on.
TTW00000366	You don't seem to take a hint. Get out of my face.
TTW00000367	I'll mind my business, you mind yours.
TTW00000368	I've got nothing to say to you. Best move on.
TTW00000369	Jesus, you really can't take a hint, can you?
TTW00000370	Let me be blunt. Go away.
TTW00000371	I don't know you, you don't know me. Let's keep it that way.
TTW00000372	How about you just mind your own business, okay?
TTW00000373	What do you need?
TTW00000374	What do you need?
TTW00000375	Nothing to report.
TTW00000376	Carry on. I've got this in hand.
TTW00000377	Kind of busy, here.
TTW00000378	If you didn't notice, I'm busy. Get lost.
TTW00000379	Find someone else to bother, local.
TTW00000380	My name's Clover. I hear you're the new man in my life.
TTW00000381	You're looking for a bodyguard, and I'm looking for a body. Sounds like we're going to have some fun times, lover.
TTW00000382	My name's Clover. I hear you're the new woman in my life.
TTW00000383	You're looking for a bodyguard, and I'm looking for a body. Sounds like we're going to have some fun times, lover.
TTW00000384	Salutations, Commander! Sergeant RL-3, Gutsy-class robotic soldier, reporting for duty!
TTW00000385	Welcome to Rivet City. Please wait while the bridge extends.
TTW00000386	Welcome to Rivet City.
TTW00000387	I guess it's my turn to thank you.
TTW00000388	Anyway, the area's secure, so you're free to talk to Three Dog if you need to.
TTW00000389	By the way, because you helped us I'm going to let you wear that Power Armor. But don't you ever forget where it came from.
TTW00000390	I guess it's my turn to thank you.
TTW00000391	Anyway, the area's secure, so you're free to talk to Three Dog if you need to.
TTW00000392	Alright. Let's go.
TTW00000393	So, it looks like you decided to do things their way huh. How come?
TTW00000394	Do not interfere with security operations.
TTW00000395	I'm sorry, but I am not at liberty to chat right now.
TTW00000396	Protect and serve.
TTW00000397	What is it now? Sir.
TTW00000398	What is it now? Ma'am.
TTW00000399	Do I look like I have time for idle chitchat?
TTW00000400	Do not interfere with security operations.
TTW00000401	I'm sorry, but I am not at liberty to chat right now.
TTW00000402	Protect and serve.
TTW00000403	Protect and serve.
TTW00000404	You will come to regret your actions.
TTW00000405	You should be proud of your accomplishment.
TTW00000406	God help us all.
TTW00000407	Got to hand it to you kid. That was a brave thing you did, risking your life to start the Purifier.
TTW00000408	But, do you know you've made my life a living hell? I'm guessing not.
TTW00000409	The hero of the Wasteland probably has more important things to worry about. Don't you?
TTW00000410	Can't say I blame you kid-o. I wouldn't have risked it either. That Sarah on the other hand, she's got a bleeding heart like her old man.
TTW00000411	Oh, and bravo for giving her that code to the Purifer. Since then, my life's been a living hell.
TTW00000412	And I have YOU to thank for that.
TTW00000413	No students in Hall without Pass. Visitors must sign in at Administration.
TTW00000414	Hey, I didn't know you were exploring, too! You don't know where we are, do you?
TTW00000415	Good things, sweetie. Tonic's brewed and bottled. Here's your pay and cut of the batch. Enjoy it!
TTW00000416	Y'ain't have the look of a local, son. Think you could help a sick woman get on the mend?
TTW00000417	Man, what the hell is this place? What do they want with all these people?
TTW00000418	If I understood the display correctly, I think we sort of launched a homing beacon of some kind down to the surface. Landed just outside D.C.
TTW00000419	So I guess you can go home if you want. Don't worry, I'll stick around up here and keep an eye on things.
TTW00000420	Hito wo azakeru na. Onushi no monoii wa sappari wakaran.
TTW00000421	Sessha wo tasuke takuba, sessha no ken wo sagashi dase!
TTW00000422	Here it is! This is the stuff I hid in here. You can have all of it, okay?
TTW00000423	Come on, I'll show you where the stuff is!
TTW00000424	Nope, nope. Not real, none of it is real. It can't hurt me if it's not real.
TTW00000425	I wasn't aware that we had anything else to say to each other.
TTW00000426	Welcome back!
TTW00000427	What are you waiting for? DESTROY HIM!
TTW00000428	Keep your distance. What are you doing in my house?
TTW00000429	You said you'd mend the still, sweetie. When did you plan on getting' to that, exactly?
TTW00000430	Thanks for mending the still, Sweetie. For this fee, the tonic had better taste like honey, though.
TTW00000431	Thanks for mending the still, Sweetie. You're a peach.
TTW00000432	Thanks for mending the still, Sweetie. Here's your pay.
TTW00000433	Oh, I hope you can find my Nadine.
TTW00000434	Hello, traveler!
TTW00000435	You are welcome to our tribe.
TTW00000436	Mr. Plik's really outdone himself this time.
TTW00000437	Good to see you again.
TTW00000438	<There is no answer>
TTW00000439	Be at peace.
TTW00000440	Keep moving, Wastelander.
TTW00000441	We've got this area locked down.
TTW00000442	Everything's above board.
TTW00000443	We're all clear here.
TTW00000444	We've got this area locked down.
TTW00000445	Not the most exciting job I ever had, but you gotta admit, it beats pulling the floaters out of the Basin. Ha ha ha.
TTW00000446	This is what happens to people who fuck with the Brotherhood.
TTW00000447	Did you need something?
TTW00000448	What do you need?
TTW00000449	If there's anything I can do to help, please just say so.
TTW00000450	Did you need something?
TTW00000451	Good to see you.
TTW00000452	Are you well, dear?
TTW00000453	Our veins flow with Atom's Eternal Glow.
TTW00000454	Arrrggghhhh!
TTW00000455	Have you heard about that new cult? They took our water! Here, read this. It's one of their pamphlets.
TTW00000456	Just can't stay away, can you?
TTW00000457	Well, I guess it's good you're not dead. And I guess I should say thanks for getting us running.
TTW00000458	If there's anything you need, just let me know.
TTW00000459	Look, I'm busy. Can we do this some other time?
TTW00000460	Well now, aren't you quite the scrapper? Congratulations.
TTW00000461	You've done well. Ashur wishes to see you. The guards will be told to allow you to pass.
TTW00000462	That fight was impressive. One more to go.
TTW00000463	And what're you doing down here, slave? Don't tell me that your pale ass is gonna throw down?
TTW00000464	You again? Back for more, huh?
TTW00000465	Unless you're looking to get killed, you'll get the fuck out of my Arena.
TTW00000466	Haha! So you're the dumbass scab that signed up to fight in the Hole, huh?
TTW00000467	Well, head on down! Faydra's waiting for you! HAHAHA!
TTW00000468	You can take weapons into the Hole.
TTW00000469	The first thing I'm going to do once I'm free is burn out Faydra's eyes. She's the worst of them.
TTW00000470	I can't stand the fucking bosses. This is disgusting.
TTW00000471	Those bastards. It's bad enough they force us to work, but they expect us to fight for their amusement!
TTW00000472	Midea is crazy. This'll never work.
TTW00000473	You're our best hope.
TTW00000474	At least they cure your radiation when you come out of the Hole.
TTW00000475	Ashur's days are numbered.
TTW00000476	You can't make me talk.
TTW00000477	It's not easy keeping these people from tearing each other apart. I don't know how Ashur did it.
TTW00000478	Nice trophy from Ashur you got there. You sure earned it.
TTW00000479	Oh joy. Our hero.
TTW00000480	Looking sharp in that suit, pal! Glad I wasn't there when you pried it off old Ashur, though. Bet it smelled like a sack full of dog asses.
TTW00000481	Do you mind? I've got a lot to do.
TTW00000482	You got a problem?
TTW00000483	Are you a hungry pet?
TTW00000484	Oh. It's talking to me again.
TTW00000485	Hey, champ!
TTW00000486	Keeping busy? Need a pick-me-up?
TTW00000487	Buzz off, new kid.
TTW00000488	I got better things to do than talk with you.
TTW00000489	Hey, meat.
TTW00000490	I'm told that you might be looking for Marco. Am I right?
TTW00000491	You'd better get out of here. They might suspect something.
TTW00000492	All right. All better.
TTW00000493	Now, get out of here before the bosses suspect something. I'll be here if you get hurt again.
TTW00000494	If you get hurt, come talk to me. I can help you out.
TTW00000495	No scabs near the gate. Back off.
TTW00000496	Jackson, man. Don't forget it.
TTW00000497	Go away.
TTW00000498	Good to see you again.
TTW00000499	Attacking the Listening Post as ordered, sir. I'll give you a new update when the objective is complete.
TTW00000500	You're the backup? Great. Just great.
TTW00000501	All right, follow me. I'll take you to Protector McGraw.
TTW00000502	Come on, let's move it. I ain't got all day.
TTW00000503	You getting in there, or what?
TTW00000504	This is a Pre-War research facility. There's technology to be had, and I am determined to have it.
TTW00000505	Unfortunately, it's locked up tight. As far as we can tell, it's linked into some kind of simulator.
TTW00000506	But we can't access the simulator, because we lack the proper interface. Your little computer there is exactly what we're looking for.
TTW00000507	So, I'll make you a deal. You access the simulator and get us into the rest of this base, and I'll give you a cut of what we find.
TTW00000508	"Payment for Services Rendered." You help us, and we'll help you.
TTW00000509	I've said my piece. If you're interested in assisting, follow Sibley to the simulation pod. Olin will help get you jacked into the sim.
TTW00000510	Nice work out there, soldier. Thanks for the back-up, but where's the rest of your detachment?
TTW00000511	Head on into the base and talk to McGraw. I'll let him know you're coming. Don't worry, they won't shoot you.
TTW00000512	Could you have been any more useless out there? You don't deserve to wear that armor after that display! Explain yourself, soldier!
TTW00000513	All right, now who the hell are you, and what do you think you're doing wearing that armor?
TTW00000514	Give me one good reason why I shouldn't put you down right now, outsider.
TTW00000515	Don't think for one second I didn't see what you're wearing. If you hadn't actually helped out here, I'd have put you down along with these mutants.
TTW00000516	You've got about three seconds to explain yourself, outsider.
TTW00000517	Damned guard detail! That sounded like a good ruckus.
TTW00000518	You can go ahead and stop right there. Who the hell are you?
TTW00000519	Well? You headed down or not?
TTW00000520	Stick with us until we make it through to the base!
TTW00000521	Take that elevator and report in to Defender Sibley.
TTW00000522	I think Defender Sibley's going to want to talk with you. Take that elevator down into the base.
TTW00000523	What sort of scrape did you get yourself into, this time?
TTW00000524	I'm going on an adventure!
TTW00000525	Oh hey, hi. You again, huh? I thought maybe you'd be blown up or shot or something by now, but I guess not. Not yet, anyway.
TTW00000526	Hey, hi! Hi, lady. Hey there. What's going on? Anything new? You have any good stories? What about Nuka-Cola, you have any of that? Huh, huh?
TTW00000527	Hey, hi! Hi, mister. Hey there. What's going on? Anything new? You have any good stories? What about Nuka-Cola, you have any of that? Huh, huh?
TTW00000528	Hey there. You have any Nuka-Cola? Even just a bit? Can I have some? Be your best friend. Honest. Totally. Not even kidding!
TTW00000529	Thanks again for saving me. You're the best!
TTW00000530	Well, you and my brother are tied for the best, at least. But that's still really good!
TTW00000531	We didn't need any mungo's help getting outta there, you know?
TTW00000532	But you did it, so, uh, thanks.
TTW00000533	But that means I gotta go back to guarding the back gate with Princess. Ugh.
TTW00000534	What now, mungo?
TTW00000535	Okay, what the hell is wrong with you, mungo? This had better be important!
TTW00000536	Oh, what now? You come to me to talk about how nice my damned cave is? Maybe a little small talk about local soil erosion or some bullshit?
TTW00000537	No, you know what? You can go take a hike, you insane mutant-fucker. Get out of my town!
TTW00000538	Mayor said to let you in alive, but he didn't say you had to stay that way. Watch your step, mungo.
TTW00000539	Whoa, a mungo down here, just walking around!
TTW00000540	Hey, new kid! Try and catch me!
TTW00000541	Tag, you're it!
TTW00000542	Aw, man! I'm it!
TTW00000543	No way, that didn't count!
TTW00000544	Stay away, mungo, I don't wanna catch old from you!
TTW00000545	Thanks for getting Penny and Squirrel back. And Sammy too, I guess.
TTW00000546	Mungo, mungo, smells like dung-o!
TTW00000547	Gosh, you're big.
TTW00000548	Nice as the weather is out here, how about you bring me a kid, so I can get back to Paradise Falls?
TTW00000549	Just waiting for you to bring me a new friend.
TTW00000550	There you go, good as new.
TTW00000551	Hey, don't mind the smoke. It's perfectly safe to breathe. Really!
TTW00000552	What's up? Anything interesting out there in the wild Wasteland?
TTW00000553	Oh, hey. What's up?
TTW00000554	Hey, someone who doesn't have a cart for me to fix or a brahmin to wash up. That's a nice change.
TTW00000555	Hope you don't mind the smell of brahmin dung. It's been one of those days.
TTW00000556	Hey. How's the wide, wild Wasteland out there?
TTW00000557	How the heck are you?
TTW00000558	You're bad. I don't think I should talk to you.
TTW00000559	Do you like being bad? Or is it just you can't help it?
TTW00000560	I bet you're so bad because your mom didn't love you.
TTW00000561	I've heard of you. You're one of the good guys!
TTW00000562	It makes me feel safer knowing you're around.
TTW00000563	You're my hero, mister. I want to be just like you when I grow up.
TTW00000564	You're my hero, ma'am. I want to be just like you when I grow up.
TTW00000565	Welcome back. Have you been successful in your search for books?
TTW00000566	You've returned. Have you brought me any books?
TTW00000567	Thank God someone's come! You have to help me! Please!
TTW00000568	You've saved my life. I am in your debt.
TTW00000569	I am forever in your debt. Thank you.
TTW00000570	We're almost to the door, don't stop now!
TTW00000571	Keep going, we're almost outside!
TTW00000572	Stay on point. We will back you up. It's the least we can offer you.
TTW00000573	Speak with Paladin Hoss.
TTW00000574	You've got some serious stones walking through here by yourself.
TTW00000575	I hear you're my mysterious investor! With your help, I've collected quite a few toys for myself. But what good are toys if they aren't played with?
TTW00000576	Thanks to you I have so many, I could hardly play with them all. So, I present to you a prize of the collection, a micro-nuke. Enjoy it in safety!
TTW00000577	Here to shop? Have a look!
TTW00000578	A friend with deep pockets is a friend indeed! Welcome to my shop!
TTW00000579	Hey, hey! Looking to buy?
TTW00000580	Looking for your fix? You came to the right man.
TTW00000581	Here to see the good doctor? Excellent.
TTW00000582	Searching for a friend out in the Wastes? No one is more reliable than a cold, hard skin of steel.
TTW00000583	Here to acquire a new mantle of metal or mesh? If you have the caps, I have the merchandise.
TTW00000584	Welcome! Welcome back! What do you have for us today?
TTW00000585	Why look who it is! My favorite associate! Have you brought me what I need?
TTW00000586	It's you! We always have time for our favorite employee!
TTW00000587	Good morning, sir.
TTW00000588	What can I do for you?
TTW00000589	Saints alive! You've done it!
TTW00000590	Quickly, let me have the ink and I will produce the copy of the Declaration of Independence!
TTW00000591	What are the next orders from the Congress?
TTW00000592	I can't wait to add the Declaration to the Society's collection.
TTW00000593	I'm expecting great things from you!
TTW00000594	What wonderful artifacts have you brought me?
TTW00000595	So, have you decided to become a part of history and triumphantly return with the Declaration of Independence in hand?
TTW00000596	Quite an impressive collection, isn't it? Well don't be shy, have a look around.
TTW00000597	Now, for my part of the bargain. Follow me.
TTW00000598	Back so soon? What is it now? Come to gawk at the caged animal?
TTW00000599	Standing around all day chit-chatting isn't going to help you track down my android. Is it?
TTW00000600	Thanks to you, we finally have that sniper, Arkansas, in a collar! You have no idea how many good men that prick put into the dirt.
TTW00000601	I'm tempted not to sell him, just so we can torment him. Use him for target practice or something. Hehehe.
TTW00000602	Here's another collar. Keep those hoochies rolling in and you'll be rich in no time.
TTW00000603	How the hell'd you get old queen Flak, into that collar?! I'm surprised you're still alive!
TTW00000604	We need to keep a close eye on that one, though. He knows our system too well.
TTW00000605	He sold us out to get into Rivet City. We'll never forget that. And now we'll make sure he never forgets it, either.
TTW00000606	Here's another collar. Keep herding the swine in here and you'll have more bottle caps than you'll know what to do with.
TTW00000607	I've been wanting to get Red in here for a long time. I have a little something special planned for her.
TTW00000608	Take another collar, and keep those puppies coming!
TTW00000609	Susan thought she could just up and leave, huh? We showed her different, didn't we?
TTW00000610	She'll think twice about slitting one of our throats now that she's collared! We'll need to come up with something extra special for her.
TTW00000611	Here's another collar. You're a welcome addition to our little operation here.
TTW00000612	Hold it right there. Nobody's allowed into Paradise Falls except on Slaver business. And I get to decide what qualifies as Slaver business.
TTW00000613	You didn't really think you could just sneak into Paradise Falls did you?
TTW00000614	Do I look like someone who wants to be your friend? Are you a moron? Why do you keep coming around? Piss off already!
TTW00000615	Unless, have you changed your mind? Do you want to take me up on the offer of employment?
TTW00000616	If you're here with some Quantum, I have caps with your name on them!
TTW00000617	Please, tell me you have some of the good stuff. I need that Quantum!
TTW00000618	Oh! I hope you're here with some Quantum!
TTW00000619	Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh! Did you find any Quantum?
TTW00000620	Oh! Did you need something else?
TTW00000621	Well? What do you think? Will you take my offer?
TTW00000622	Before I get to the little proposition I have for you let me tell you a little bit about Nuka-Cola Quantum.
TTW00000623	So, you ready to hear me out? I have a bit of a proposition for you.
TTW00000624	But before I get to that, let me tell you a little bit about Nuka-Cola Quantum.
TTW00000625	Bringing me some Quantum I hope?
TTW00000626	Thanks for getting me out of there. I owe you one.
TTW00000627	Now you get back in there and make sure Penny stays safe. I'll try and contact her sometime, if I can. I need to lay low for a while.
TTW00000628	Thanks for getting me out of there. I owe you one.
TTW00000629	Listen, there are kids in there. You've gotta get them out too, if you can. Just be careful.
TTW00000630	I'm gonna lay low for a while. As soon as they realize I'm gone, they're going to come looking for me. Thanks again.
TTW00000631	Thanks for getting me out of there. I owe you one.
TTW00000632	I'm gonna lay low for a while. As soon as they realize I'm gone, they're going to come looking for me. Thanks again.
TTW00000633	I gotta get someplace safe.
TTW00000634	What?
TTW00000635	So what's the deal, mungo?
TTW00000636	Well, I guess this is one way to do it. We could've escaped, you know.
TTW00000637	If we're going to leave, then let's get it over with.
TTW00000638	So you gonna take care of that guard, or what?
TTW00000639	My hands are tied here. It's not like I want to be working with a mungo like you, but I got no choice. Come on.
TTW00000640	This place is a whole lot quieter, now. Thanks, I guess.
TTW00000641	I got nothing to say to you.
TTW00000642	Oh, hey! Watch your step, I think one of my test subjects got loose. But don't worry, it's probably harmless.
TTW00000643	Oh, hey! Kinda busy here, but I guess I can talk for a bit. What's up?
TTW00000644	Hey, don't mind the smell. I was just testing a few chemicals, but it's perfectly safe to breathe. Really!
TTW00000645	What's up? Anything interesting out there in the wild Wasteland?
TTW00000646	How's it going out there in the Wastes?
TTW00000647	You can follow us as far as GNR. But keep your head down if you don't want it to get blown off.
TTW00000648	Please be seated in the nearest available Tranquility Lounger. Thank you for your cooperation.
TTW00000649	Please take a seat in the Tranquility Lounger.
TTW00000650	Welcome to Vault 112, Resident! According to sensors, you have arrived 202.3 years behind schedule.
TTW00000651	Please re-dress in your Vault-Tec issued Vault suit before proceeding.
TTW00000652	Once dressed, please proceed down the stairs to the main floor so that you may enter your assigned Tranquility Lounger.
TTW00000653	Please dress in your Vault 112 suit. Remove all other articles of clothing to prevent damage to the equipment.
TTW00000654	Thank you for your cooperation.
TTW00000655	Please dress in your Vault 112 suit. Remove all other articles of clothing to prevent damage to the equipment.
TTW00000656	Thank you for your cooperation.
TTW00000657	I warned you!
TTW00000658	I guess you're wondering where I'm going. I'm off to annex Old Olney and forge the New Republic of Dave! Don't try to stop me!
TTW00000659	Yeah? What do you want?
TTW00000660	Out with it, Ambassador. This Republic isn't going to run itself.
TTW00000661	Stop right there, mister! Whatcha think you're doing in the Republic of Dave?
TTW00000662	Stop right there, lady! Whatcha think you're doing in the Republic of Dave?
TTW00000663	Dave says you're okay? Fine.
TTW00000664	Hey, who are you? What do you want from the Republic of Dave?
TTW00000665	Listen, I can't thank you enough. You convinced me that I could do this, and you were right. I want you to have something.
TTW00000666	Dave kept some big weapon or something locked up in the safe in his office. The code is 1138.
TTW00000667	It's yours if you want it. We don't need it anymore.
TTW00000668	I just can't thank you enough!
TTW00000669	Things are going to be different around here!
TTW00000670	I heard that Dave allowed you to stay. Well, welcome stranger. Just be mindful of the children.
TTW00000671	Who are you? Is it okay for you to be here?
TTW00000672	So Dave gave you the okay, huh? Well, welcome then.
TTW00000673	I run the Museum of Dave, where the children of the Republic can learn about their heritage.
TTW00000674	President Daddy says that people from outside the Republic are bad.
TTW00000675	Are you really from the Wasteland? Wooooow!
TTW00000676	With the fuses in place, you should be able to access the mainframe. No need to come back to the control room; just head straight there.
TTW00000677	You're doing great out there. Keep it up.
TTW00000678	Here we are. Where it all began. You remember your mother's favorite passage?
TTW00000679	Revelation 21:6. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life, freely.
TTW00000680	Don't you see? This is what it all means. The water, the purifier. THIS is the water of life. Your mother's dream.
TTW00000681	No point in wasting time. Let's get to work. There's much to be done.
TTW00000682	I'm not trying to put you off, but we need to get to Project Purity. Anything else can wait until later.
TTW00000683	Good to see you again, sweetie.
TTW00000684	Mr. Harris is nice to us, but he doesn't read the stories the same way that my daddy did.
TTW00000685	I'm not really sure what happened. Mr. Harris said that our parents went away, and they won't be back.
TTW00000686	Mr. Harris is a lot like my dad. I never knew he could be so nice.
TTW00000687	Busy busy busy, a wife's work is never done!
TTW00000688	I'm not sure why you'd come back here, but I'm glad to see you.
TTW00000689	Little by little, each day, I'm trying to clean up the mess my family left.
TTW00000690	What do you want, square?
TTW00000691	To tell you the truth, I'm glad that fool is dead.
TTW00000692	Eulogy handles the business.
TTW00000693	Look, nothing personal, but if you need something, talk to the clown in the hat.
TTW00000694	You're a mess. I hope you brought a lot of money with you.
TTW00000695	Are you just going to bleed on me, or are you going to pay me to fix you?
TTW00000696	I love the sight of a limping Waster. You just look like a walking pile of caps to me.
TTW00000697	Well now, look at you limping in here like that. Did you bring some caps for Auntie Cutter?
TTW00000698	Been in a few fights, have we? Well, that's why they pay me the big bucks...
TTW00000699	Just let me know if you need anything, and I'll do whatever I can to procure it.
TTW00000700	Look. I told you. My name's Forty. I'm not inclined to change it, so unless you've got something good to say, you'd best make it fast.
TTW00000701	Hey. Talk fast, they hate it when I talk to customers.
TTW00000702	Haha! Hello! I am Ymir!
TTW00000703	Hey sorry, man. Let me get out of your way!
TTW00000704	Whoa there. Easy, killer. I'm movin', I'm movin'!
TTW00000705	Heard about you. You're some pretty slick shit.
TTW00000706	Respect.
TTW00000707	You look like a damn fool in that Vault Suit.
TTW00000708	Nice! Did you get that monkey suit from the Brotherhood?
TTW00000709	Sorry, bro. Got nothin' to say to you.
TTW00000710	Sorry, chica. Got nothin' to say to you.
TTW00000711	Keep walkin'.
TTW00000712	I can't believe that Grouse let you in here.
TTW00000713	Don't think I won't throw your ass in the pens with the rest of the meat.
TTW00000714	You don't exactly look like you belong here.
TTW00000715	Okay, seriously. Leave me alone.
TTW00000716	*sniff* Smells like meat. Move on.
TTW00000717	No luck finding dear old dad? Can't say it surprises me. Wasteland's a big place. Maybe you need a drink.
TTW00000718	You're still standing here, and I can't think why. You know where your father went. Seems to me you ought to be out searching the Wastes.
TTW00000719	Looks like you went and got yourself irradiated. Too bad for you, I'm off duty. Stop by the clinic in the morning.
TTW00000720	The Doctor is off duty. Go away.
TTW00000721	Boy, you're glowin' like a goddamn reactor core. You need help?
TTW00000722	Girl, you're glowin' like a goddamn reactor core. You need help?
TTW00000723	What the hell are you standin' there bleedin' on my floor for? If you need help, then ask for it, dammit!
TTW00000724	Don't shoot! Please! Just tell me what you want!
TTW00000725	Be careful, mister. My dad is right over there. Try anything, and I'll yell for him.
TTW00000726	Be careful, lady. My dad is right over there. Try anything, and I'll yell for him.
TTW00000727	Dad usually doesn't like when I talk to strangers.
TTW00000728	We get people tryin' to settle down here all the time. Anyway, if you're hungry, you came to the right place. What can I get you?
TTW00000729	Hey. What can I get you?
TTW00000730	So what'll it be today? We've got some noodles. And the Brahmin steak is pretty good, too.
TTW00000731	So what's it going to be?
TTW00000732	The noodle stand is closed right now. If you need something, talk to Leo.
TTW00000733	Well goddamn. You're new, right? I've got to admit, the outfit's a little weird, but that's okay, that's okay. Name's Leo Stahl. It's a pleasure!
TTW00000734	Well goddamn. You're new, right? Name's Leo Stahl. It's a pleasure! It's a pleasure! Yeah!
TTW00000735	Hey hey! Nice to see you! Everything okay? You doing all right? You need something? Come on, talk to me!
TTW00000736	Alright! Good to see you again? What's new? Feel like having a drink? C'mon, let's talk!
TTW00000737	Heya! How's it going?
TTW00000738	Good to see you're staying out of trouble.
TTW00000739	Got my eye on you. Don't do anything stupid.
TTW00000740	Hi, I'm Maggie. I live with Billy. Billy Creel. Do you know him? He's not my dad or anything, but he takes care of me now.
TTW00000741	If you see Nathan, tell that man to get his ass back home.
TTW00000742	You seen Nathan anywhere around here?
TTW00000743	Listen, I'm working right now. So make it quick, okay?
TTW00000744	I'm just here to guard the goods. That's all.
TTW00000745	I'm here to watch over this stuff. Only touch what you've paid for, and we'll have no problem.
TTW00000746	I've got my eye on you.
TTW00000747	This place is so much better than Moriarty's. That place is just filled with scum.
TTW00000748	Pull up a chair if you want.
TTW00000749	Hey there, stranger. Talk to Leo if you need something.
TTW00000750	Always good to see a new face.
TTW00000751	Leo's a nice guy, a bit twitchy, but nice.
TTW00000752	Don't mind Andy, he's just a busy guy.
TTW00000753	So, you're awake.
TTW00000754	Let's keep this nice and simple. You're going to tell me the code for that Purifier, and you're going to tell me now.
TTW00000755	I would surely have perished if it wasn't for Mister Tenpenny and his tower.
TTW00000756	I would surely have perished if it wasn't for Roy Phillips and his tower.
TTW00000757	So, Crowley is dead, eh?
TTW00000758	Here's your pay. Now, don't spend it all in one place, unless that place is Tenpenny Tower.
TTW00000759	Fancy that! A visitor. I seldom get visitors. Which is a tiresome shame because I'm usually relentlessly bored out of my right mind!
TTW00000760	All of these confounded people fluster about like I'm made of eggshells and about to fall to pieces at any moment. I'm surprised they even let you in.
TTW00000761	So what do you think of my fine tower here? It's quite the jewel of the Wasteland isn't it? I daresay I'm quite proud of it myself.
TTW00000762	Welcome to New Urban Apparel. I carry the finest in Pre-War clothes. Hurry up, let's get you out of those old rags and into something fabulous!
TTW00000763	Hurry up, let's get you out of those old rags and into something fabulous!
TTW00000764	You look hurt. It's a good thing you've come in.
TTW00000765	Happy Holidays! Care for a drink?
TTW00000766	Ah yes. Mister Burke is expecting you. He is waiting for you on the balcony.
TTW00000767	Mister Tenpenny isn't taking callers.
TTW00000768	I'm on duty. Can't talk. Direct your security concerns to Chief Gustavo directly.
TTW00000769	I'm not here for your entertainment.
TTW00000770	It was so weird! All of a sudden the ants went nuts and started fighting each other.
TTW00000771	It was like they were totally crazy! It was really scary, but kinda cool at the same time, ya know what I mean?
TTW00000772	It was so weird! All of a sudden the ants went nuts and started fighting each other.
TTW00000773	It was like they were totally crazy! It was really scary, but kinda cool at the same time, ya know what I mean?
TTW00000774	Come on! Tell me already!
TTW00000775	Did you change your mind or something?
TTW00000776	Well, don't just stand there. You're distracting me. I must calculate the most efficient way to get to my equipment.
TTW00000777	Well, don't just stand there. You're distracting me. I must calculate the most efficient way to get to my equipment.
TTW00000778	Well, so much for celebrating.
TTW00000779	One of us is going to have to go in there and turn the damned thing on. And whoever does it isn't coming back out.
TTW00000780	Not exactly how I imagined going out, you know?
TTW00000781	So, what should we do? Draw straws?
TTW00000782	Before we get started, I wanted to let you know that my father and I have been talking.
TTW00000783	The Pride and I have decided that after all you've survived, you've done enough to be an honorary member of Lyon's Pride.
TTW00000784	So congratulations. Membership comes with some privileges, including our Power Armor. You want the full suit, or the Recon armor?
TTW00000785	Thanks, stranger. That thing would probably have killed me if it wasn't for you.
TTW00000786	I wish I had more, but I want you to have this. And I won't take no for an answer.
TTW00000787	It's not much, I know, but it's mine! So, if you need anything, just let me know. Greta will get you any food you want, and I handle the rooms.
TTW00000788	It's so good to have someone new here, even if it is an ugly ol' smoothskin! I'm kidding! I'm just kiddin! Don't make that face! You'll love it here.
TTW00000789	Talk to Ahzrukhal.
TTW00000790	No. Go talk to Ahzrukhal.
TTW00000791	Sorry. I'm on a break. I'll be back in a bit if you need some food.
TTW00000792	Hey. I saw you over there talking to Carol. She's friendly, isn't she? But don't you get any ideas about her. Got it? Good.
TTW00000793	Now, do you want something to eat?
TTW00000794	Oh, you again.
TTW00000795	Oh, hello, my boy! You've come back for more stories from ol' Quinn, have you?
TTW00000796	Oh, hello, my girl! You've come back for more stories from ol' Quinn, have you?
TTW00000797	Didn't you hear me? Leave us alone.
TTW00000798	Well look who's back. What can I do you for, smoothskin?
TTW00000799	Did you see that? Charon just shot Ahzrukhal!
TTW00000800	What the fuck happened?
TTW00000801	It's so weird here without Ahzrukhal.
TTW00000802	I still can't believe that Charon shot Ahzrukhal. I never saw that one coming.
TTW00000803	There are a lot more of us down here than there are of you, smoothskin. You just behave yourself.
TTW00000804	Well done! You have defeated the vile AntAgonizer, and you've brought back her suit so that we may destroy the last taint of her villainy!
TTW00000805	Hand it to me, and I'll make sure that no one else can ever bear the mantle of the foul AntAgonizer!
TTW00000806	You had best hand over the AntAgonizer suit. It's too dangerous to let it fall into the wrong hands.
TTW00000807	Oh man! Did you see it? Did you see it? The AntAgonizer was all like, "Fear me!" But the Mechanist was all, "Stop, evil-doer!"
TTW00000808	Whew! You wouldn't believe how much trouble those two have caused in this town. We've been looking for someone to get rid of them for a long time.
TTW00000809	But you just walked in and cleaned up the town, easy as you please! We're in your debt, that's for sure.
TTW00000810	I'm mayor of Canterbury Commons, think of me as your own Uncle Roe. And take this, as our thanks for cleaning up the town.
TTW00000811	Whew! You wouldn't believe how much trouble those two have caused in this town. We've been looking for someone to get rid of them for a long time.
TTW00000812	But you just walked in, downed one, and drove off the other, easy as you please! That'll be the last we see of them, you can be sure of that!
TTW00000813	I'm mayor of Canterbury Commons, think of me as your own Uncle Roe. And take this, as our thanks for cleaning up the town.
TTW00000814	Glad to see you're finally awake. I can't believe they made you do that stupid ceremony.
TTW00000815	By insulting the Tree Father, you've insulted us all. You are no longer a guest here. I'd advise you to leave immediately.
TTW00000816	Any chance the Wasteland had for recovery someday is now gone.
TTW00000817	Please... I wish to be alone right now.
TTW00000818	What is it you wish to talk about, my friend?
TTW00000819	Not quite what I had in mind. But you get a chance to try again. Go to it!
TTW00000820	It's good to see you back. But you'd better get to the lab right away, and report to Elder Lyons.
TTW00000821	I swear, these kids'd be lost without me here to powder their asses.
TTW00000822	How may I serve you, friend of Steel?
TTW00000823	"If we value the pursuit of knowledge, we must be free to follow wherever that search may lead us."
TTW00000824	I found that in an ancient book. The words of wisdom of one of the greatest men of the former civilization.
TTW00000825	Now, I'm really very busy. Is there something you needed?
TTW00000826	What do you want, outsider?
TTW00000827	I salute you, warrior. You walk among us, but apart from us. How may I aid you?
TTW00000828	Don't hurt me!
TTW00000829	Help us!
TTW00000830	What's the status on those Tenpenny bigots?
TTW00000831	Well kid, what've you accomplished?
TTW00000832	What's the word at Tenpenny, kid?
TTW00000833	What do you want?
TTW00000834	I'm really not in the mood, so leave me alone.
TTW00000835	Leave me alone! Me and Bob have better things to do than speak to a murderer!
TTW00000836	Now go away, never come back!
TTW00000837	So what's the deal? You gonna get me some Sugar Bombs or what?
TTW00000838	I like these guys, they let me play with their pucks.
TTW00000839	Hey, I may be just a Winger now, but I'll make Centre soon.
TTW00000840	Sorry, we've got practice. Maybe we'll cross sticks again one day.
TTW00000841	My name's Agatha. What brings you to my home?
TTW00000842	My my my. You certainly do look a little bit worn out from your travels.
TTW00000843	Oh, just look at my terrible manners! I'm Agatha. It's so nice to meet you.
TTW00000844	Now, what brings you all the way out here?
TTW00000845	Have you decided to find me a violin?
TTW00000846	Quick! Unlock the door!
TTW00000847	You've got to get this door unlocked!
TTW00000848	We can talk back at Big Town. Let's get out of here!
TTW00000849	I'll feel better once we're safe.
TTW00000850	Thank God! Who are you? Never mind, I don't care right now. Let's go get Red and get out of here!
TTW00000851	Come on, you've got to untie me!
TTW00000852	Thanks! Who are you? Never mind, I don't care right now. Let's go get Red and get out of here!
TTW00000853	You lead. I'll follow. Let's go! Move it!
TTW00000854	No more talking! Let's get out of here!
TTW00000855	What's the hold up?
TTW00000856	Where's Red?
TTW00000857	Guess we can try living with the Ghouls.
TTW00000858	I hope those Ghouls try to get along with us civilized people.
TTW00000859	Hello, hello!
TTW00000860	I'm mighty appreciative of your straightening things out. Perhaps next time I go on safari I'll take you along.
TTW00000861	Is there something you require?
TTW00000862	Thank you for dealing with those Ghouls. You're a real hero.
TTW00000863	Thanks for helping those Ghouls. They really aren't so bad.
TTW00000864	Good job removing our little pest problem!
TTW00000865	I have nothing to say to you. Except this: Watch your back!
TTW00000866	Hrmph.
TTW00000867	You did it! You got rid of those vile creatures! Good show!
TTW00000868	You'll get yours soon enough.
TTW00000869	Goodbye!
TTW00000870	Hello friend. Ghoul physiology is fascinating!
TTW00000871	Hello friend!
TTW00000872	Those Ghouls won't be bothering us anymore, will they?
TTW00000873	Hello!
TTW00000874	Come to pour salt into the wound? Well, I won't stand for it!
TTW00000875	Zombie-lover!
TTW00000876	Fabulous!
TTW00000877	You think I want to talk to you?
TTW00000878	You've ruined my life!
TTW00000879	Hey comrade! Those Ghoul's seem like a real community, hey? Adversity must have made them strong.
TTW00000880	Hey there!
TTW00000881	Take a real good look, because you won't be getting any of this!
TTW00000882	Hah! I'm doing just fine, no thanks to you!
TTW00000883	What do YOU want?
TTW00000884	Glad to see you were able to convince these people to open their minds a little. Those Ghouls will liven things up around here for a long time!
TTW00000885	Well, it'll take a little elbow grease but then this place will be a true home!
TTW00000886	Bastards. Could have done it the easy way and just let us live here with them. Oh well. Guess we better get started with the clean up.
TTW00000887	Don't know how you did it. I'd never allow those zombies room and board. But as long as Tenpenny keeps paying me I'll stay.
TTW00000888	Good job handling those zombies!
TTW00000889	What's up? Kill any more zombies lately?
TTW00000890	Hey soldier!
TTW00000891	You have my condolences. Your father was a good man.
TTW00000892	Don't you have something to do?
TTW00000893	How did you get past the guard? What do you want?
TTW00000894	Go ahead. Try out your new gun on those targets over there.
TTW00000895	I heard how you helped out Timebomb. I'm not sure why you did it, but thanks. I only hope that he lives long enough to appreciate your help.
TTW00000896	Now, did you need something?
TTW00000897	What is it?
TTW00000898	Woah, looks like you've seen some action. Do you need help?
TTW00000899	Hey, pal. What's up?
TTW00000900	Things are looking good here, bud.
TTW00000901	Watch the Wastes. Keep track of movement. Uh, what? Did you need something?
TTW00000902	Hello, stranger. I'm Tinker Joe, premier supplier of robotic parts and service throughout the D.C. Wasteland.
TTW00000903	Thank you, friend. We won't forget this.
TTW00000904	Shh. Not too loud. I don't really want people to know that we're doin' business.
TTW00000905	Hey, good to see you again. What do you need?
TTW00000906	I hear that you decided to speak to Ian regardless of my warnings.
TTW00000907	Be that as it may, I am still interested in what you conversed about. Did he come to a decision?
TTW00000908	RL-3 regrets to inform that you are obviously unfit to command, sir!
TTW00000909	Changed your mind about the job, yet?
TTW00000910	You did a good thing, delivering that component to Zimmer. Telling him the android was dead. For that, I'm going to entrust you with some information.
TTW00000911	The android's transformation was done by a man named Pinkerton, here in Rivet City. He's hidden down in the broken fore section of the ship.
TTW00000912	You'll need to swim to reach him, but if you're inclined, Pinkerton can perform a facial reconstruction on you as well.
TTW00000913	We'd best not be seen speaking with each other further. If you want a new face, see Pinkerton, down in the flooded fore section of the carrier.
TTW00000914	The android's transformation was done by a man named Pinkerton, here in Rivet City. He's hidden down in the broken fore section of the ship.
TTW00000915	You'll need to swim to reach him, but if you're inclined, Pinkerton can perform a facial reconstruction on you as well.
TTW00000916	Yeah! I made it to Big Town! Big Town! Hurray! Now I just need to find Red.
TTW00000917	What? Oh! I didn't see you there. I get that way sometimes when I'm thinking.
TTW00000918	You have a picture! And such a large one, too.
TTW00000919	I'll have no problems restoring the Memorial with this. Thank you!
TTW00000920	Make it quick. I've got a lot of work to do.
TTW00000921	Those Slavers are all dead. We must stay vigilant. There may be more of them.
TTW00000922	I hear you found a great picture for Caleb. Once the Memorial site is safe, we can move there.
TTW00000923	We made it! The Memorial is really ours! I cannot thank you enough.
TTW00000924	Here, take this. It's a token of our thanks.
TTW00000925	You have been good to your word. You are welcome at the Temple of the Union anytime.
TTW00000926	Take these schematics as a token of our gratitude.
TTW00000927	Is there something else?
TTW00000928	What's your business stranger?
TTW00000929	You again. Don't dawdle. Get in here.
TTW00000930	You ain't supposed to be looking at me, to say nothing of talking to me.
TTW00000931	Now, beat it! Hannibal is waiting for you.
TTW00000932	You don't look like much, stranger. Bet you run from Radroaches.
TTW00000933	I'm Simone Cameron. Don't fuck with me. Hannibal says I can't shoot you, but I ain't trusting you with a gun to my back.
TTW00000934	Are you trying to piss me off?
TTW00000935	Make it quick. I'm busy.
TTW00000936	Hey! It's my favorite wanker! I am so fucking glad I talked you out of putting a bullet in my brain. Hah ha!
TTW00000937	Hey! It's my favorite bitch assassin! Hah ha! I am so fucking glad I talked you out of putting a bullet in my brain!
TTW00000938	It's always good to see one of our number here. Have you brought tales and trophies of justice?
TTW00000939	The Regulators welcome you back.
TTW00000940	The unrighteous will be punished.
TTW00000941	We bring law to a lawless land.
TTW00000942	We are justice. We are the law.
TTW00000943	Stay true to yourself and to the law. This is the rule of the Regulator.
TTW00000944	Well, according to this, you're in line to be trained as a Laundry Cannon Operator. First time for everything, indeed.
TTW00000945	Looks like the diner's going to get a new Fry Cook. I'll just say this once: hold the mustard, extra pickles. Ha ha ha.
TTW00000946	Huh. I wonder who will be brave enough to be your first customer as the vault's new Tattoo Artist? I promise it won't be me.
TTW00000947	Look, I'm not looking to rumble with you. How about we just stay out of each other's business, like usual.
TTW00000948	Goodbye. We'll miss you.
TTW00000949	Good riddance. Get out.
TTW00000950	I guess you can see how bad things are down here. Sorry, where were we going?
TTW00000951	Make it quick.
TTW00000952	Hey, if it ain't a fellow Tunnel Snake, slumming it down here with the old crew?
TTW00000953	I thought you'd be out there tearing up the Wasteland and raising Hell!
TTW00000954	But if you've gotta be back, might as well make yourself useful. You gotta help us.
TTW00000955	I hope you're making progress with my father. I can't imagine anyone else who would convince him we should venture outside.
TTW00000956	Ah, another patient! What's it to be, eh? Appendectomy? Tonsillectomy?
TTW00000957	Hysterectomy?
TTW00000958	Well, if it isn't my star pupil.
TTW00000959	<yawn> What?
TTW00000960	I'll be damned! You did it, didn't you? You disarmed that thing!
TTW00000961	Here's your reward. Hell, why don't you move in? Could use someone like you. Got an empty place here you can use. Here's the key and deed.
TTW00000962	It ain't much to look at. But talk with Moira. She's got random odds and ends you might be able to spruce the place up with.
TTW00000963	I'll be damned! You did it, didn't you? You disarmed that thing!
TTW00000964	And all without asking for pay, too. Hell, why don't you move in? Here's the key and the deed to an empty house. Consider yourself a Megaton citizen!
TTW00000965	Oh and talk with Moira at Craterside Supply. She's got random odds and ends you might be able to spruce the place up with.
TTW00000966	Not now!
TTW00000967	My, my. Just when I had all but given up hope. My dear girl, I am very happy to make your acquaintance. I am Mister Burke.
TTW00000968	And you, well, you are not a resident of this putrescent cesspool. That makes you a rather valuable individual.
TTW00000969	You haven't rigged the bomb yet? If it's information you need, get to it. Time is wasting.
TTW00000970	Back again, hmm? Perhaps you've reconsidered my offer?
TTW00000971	The pulse charge is rigged? Excellent! Excellent!
TTW00000972	Ah. The anticipation is palpable. Isn't it?
TTW00000973	When you have finished savoring the moment, you may have the honor of pressing the button. Oh, and mind your eyes. It'll be brighter than bright.
TTW00000974	The detonator is right over there. You may have the honor. Hit the switch!
TTW00000975	I've been asked to extend to you an invitation to reside at Tenpenny Tower.
TTW00000976	Here's the key, and deed, to your new master suite. It's on the top floor, first door on your right from the elevator. Enjoy your new accommodations.
TTW00000977	Oh, and if you wish to spruce the place up a bit, speak with Lydia Montenegro in the Boutique le Chic.
TTW00000978	Here's the key, and deed, to your new master suite. It's on the top floor, first door on your right from the elevator. Enjoy your new accommodations.
TTW00000979	Get the hell out of my face.
TTW00000980	If you're going to continue to irritate me, I'm not going to be so nice about it.
TTW00000981	How long have I been out?
TTW00000982	Yeah? What is it? Ready to help?
TTW00000983	Yeah? What do you want?
TTW00000984	I'm afraid she's going to be out for a while. She's not well at all.
TTW00000985	Don't worry though, I'm sure the rest of Reilly's Rangers will show up soon and take her home.
TTW00000986	I'm going to head back to Ranger Compound and see if Reilly's back yet. If you make your way there, Reilly will pay you herself.
TTW00000987	If I can ever be of medical assistance or you need some supplies or repairs, let me or Donovan know.
TTW00000988	Again, I'm not sure how to thank you.
TTW00000989	I'm going to head back to Ranger Compound to see if Reilly's back yet. Look me up anytime you're in the neighborhood.
TTW00000990	If I can ever be of medical assistance or you need some supplies or repairs, let me or Donovan know.
TTW00000991	Hi. I'm Angela. My dad runs Gary's Galley. If you want anything to eat, talk to him.
TTW00000992	Hi. I'm Angela. I run Gary's Galley. Let me know when you are ready to order.
TTW00000993	Welcome to Gary's Galley. Can I take your order?
TTW00000994	Lay a hand on Doctor Zimmer, and I'll snap your neck like a chicken bone.
TTW00000995	That's close enough. Keep your hands where I can see them.
TTW00000996	The market is closing soon. You'd better make it quick.
TTW00000997	Welcome to Potomac Attire. I am Bannon, proprietor and City Council member.
TTW00000998	I carry discriminating attire for discriminating customers.
TTW00000999	Welcome to Potomac Attire.
TTW00001000	I think I've seen you in here before. When you're ready to buy, just let me know.
TTW00001001	Have you found anything you like?
TTW00001002	I'm Belle Bonny, and this is the Muddy Rudder.
TTW00001003	I'll tell you what I tell all the fresh meat. Don't start anything down here or I'll have Brock kick your ass.
TTW00001004	I'm Belle Bonny, and this is the Muddy Rudder.
TTW00001005	I'll tell you what I tell all the fresh meat. Don't start anything down here or I'll have to kick your ass.
TTW00001006	You're a new one. I'm Belle Bonny of the Muddy Rudder. Make it quick.
TTW00001007	I'm Brock, the bouncer. I take care of the troublemakers. You aren't going to be a troublemaker, are you?
TTW00001008	Don't tell me your problems.
TTW00001009	This place won't clean itself. That's my job.
TTW00001010	Look, I'm busy.
TTW00001011	This is A Quick Fix. I mean that's the name of our shop. Paulie and mine that is. My name is Cindy. Cindy Cantelli.
TTW00001012	This is A Quick Fix. I mean that's the name of the shop. My name is Cindy. Cindy Cantelli.
TTW00001013	Nice to see you again. Are you looking for a quick fix?
TTW00001014	Made up your mind yet?
TTW00001015	I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
TTW00001016	Yes, miss.
TTW00001017	Maybe you don't know who you're talking to. I'm Commander Danvers, assistant chief of security.
TTW00001018	Have you seen Angela? I need to ask her something about our wedding.
TTW00001019	You're wounded. Let me bandage that.
TTW00001020	It's almost closing time. I'd get out of here if I was you.
TTW00001021	This here is Flak and Shrapnel's gun shop. Pretty catchy, huh? Take a look around. If you see anything you like, I'll be right over here.
TTW00001022	Decided to check out the shop, eh? If you want any of this shit, just holler.
TTW00001023	Made up your mind?
TTW00001024	I'm Flak. If you want something better than that peashooter, stop by Flak and Shrapnel's.
TTW00001025	I'm Flak. If you want something better than that stick of yours, stop by Flak and Shrapnel's.
TTW00001026	I'm Flak. If you want a decent weapon, stop by Flak and Shrapnel's.
TTW00001027	Let me introduce myself. I am Gary Staley gourmet chef and gourmand. I'll be preparing your meal.
TTW00001028	My specialty is Mirelurk Cakes. Although the iguana is very popular too.
TTW00001029	Ah! I knew you wouldn't be able to stay away from my cuisine for long.
TTW00001030	How may I serve you?
TTW00001031	I'm Gary. Gary Staley. If you ever get hungry, stop by Gary's Galley.
TTW00001032	Make it quick. I'm on a tight schedule.
TTW00001033	This isn't a good time. My daughter, C.J. is missing.
TTW00001034	If you hear anything, please let me know right away.
TTW00001035	This place could use a few more people willing to work. Everything is falling apart. I'm the only one willing to fix it.
TTW00001036	I'm busy. I've got a lot of repairs to make.
TTW00001037	I'm scared. Will you take me home? Take me to my Mom.
TTW00001038	I'm scared. Will you take me home?
TTW00001039	I heard Sister is dead. Thank God!
TTW00001040	I'd rather be alone just now.
TTW00001041	I'm just taking things one day at a time.
TTW00001042	Just leave me alone.
TTW00001043	Haven't seen you in here before. Do you need a fix? I might have what you need. You can always come see Paulie to get what you need.
TTW00001044	Who are you? Got any Psycho? I could really use a fix, but I'm broke.
TTW00001045	Ha ha! I run the chem shop, but I'm broke and can't buy chems!
TTW00001046	Looking for a fix?
TTW00001047	Make it quick, will ya? I'm coming down and I gotta get my fix.
TTW00001048	How the hell did you get in here? Hmph. I suppose you can't be all that bad if you made it this far without dying.
TTW00001049	You'd better get out of here. The guards are going to close up soon.
TTW00001050	Howdy. I'm Seagrave. Seagrave Holmes. I have a little of just about everything here.
TTW00001051	Hey! I heard that Bannon got caught trying to frame me.
TTW00001052	I also heard you ratted him out. I think you've earned a true, blue friendship discount.
TTW00001053	You sneak into my room, steal my property, and then tell the world about it.
TTW00001054	I'd ban you from my shop if they'd let me. Instead I'll just have to settle for ripping you off.
TTW00001055	Take a look around. I got all kinds of stuff in here.
TTW00001056	We're going to close soon. You'd better get out of here.
TTW00001057	They call me Shrapnel. I run this place. Got the best damn armament you'll ever see.
TTW00001058	If you want any of this shit, just say so. Otherwise keep your fingers the hell away from the triggers. I don't want no accidents.
TTW00001059	Don't know you, don't care. Keep it short.
TTW00001060	What's your beef?
TTW00001061	I'm Tammy. Just leave me alone, okay.
TTW00001062	Hey, good lookin'. How come you haven't bought me a drink yet?
TTW00001063	Shit. Just what this hole needs. Another woman.
TTW00001064	Either buy me a drink, or take your skanky ass somewhere else.
TTW00001065	Welcome to the Weatherly Hotel. I'm your hostess, Vera Weatherly.
TTW00001066	Welcome back, ma'am.
TTW00001067	Welcome back, sir.
TTW00001068	Something else in you needing an answer?
TTW00001069	Ugh! It's bad enough the indignities you've put me through, must you continue to prattle on at me?
TTW00001070	No time to waste! Go deal with the Think Tank!
TTW00001071	I'll see you at the Sink. Good luck.
TTW00001072	Oh, it's you again. What do you want?
TTW00001073	Nice to see you back. I trust the adventuring is going well.
TTW00001074	Well, well, look who finally dragged themselves in out of the Wasteland. And where have we been, hmm? Crawling through pits of radioactive muck again?
TTW00001075	You've been seeing the other light switch, haven't you? Am I not enough for you any more?
TTW00001076	Hoi!
TTW00001077	Katu Veo. Nayoo?
TTW00001078	All better now, you big baby. Can I get back to work now?
TTW00001079	Okay, you should be fine, and ready to run off and play.
TTW00001080	I'll say this; it's easier to work on a mungo, since you're a lot bigger. Easier to find a vein, at least.
TTW00001081	Now next time, try to be where the bullets aren't.
TTW00001082	There you go. All better, you big baby. You need anything else?
TTW00001083	That should keep you going for a bit longer.
TTW00001084	Feel better? You should, that was the good stuff. Need anything else?
TTW00001085	They never told us how expensive it was to get onto the Strip!
TTW00001086	I never should have left California.
TTW00001087	That son of a bitch Keith cheated me! I know he did!
TTW00001088	You lose all your money too?
TTW00001089	Hey, you got a hit for me?
TTW00001090	Don't you be touching Keith's stuff!
TTW00001091	The salvage business has really slowed down since those ghouls took over REPCONN.
TTW00001092	House selling out to the NCR? Who woulda figured him for a fink?
TTW00001093	I don't want to join the Great Khans.
TTW00001094	Since Johnson won't be coming with us, you might as well take his suit of Power Armor. I'll teach you the basics of how to use it.
TTW00001095	I appreciate you keeping Orion in the group. Since I won't be needing my armor - makes the cockpit a bit cramped - you should take it.
TTW00001096	It'll take a few hours to show you how to use it properly, so let's get started.
TTW00001097	I ain't got nothing for you to eat. If you're hungry, see Ruby Nash.
TTW00001098	Now you freed Deputy Beagle, all Primm needs is a law man who can shoot a gun without wetting hisself.
TTW00001099	I hear you aim to bring rule of law back to our town. God knows we need the help.
TTW00001100	Those soldiers you brought down on us is all business, stranger. Better than lawlessness, though. So you've got my thanks.
TTW00001101	This Sheriff Meyers you found for us is working out. Knows his business. We owe you a debt.
TTW00001102	You'll probably want to talk to Hayes.
TTW00001103	Never liked Bighorners.
TTW00001104	I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing medical supplies. We're all stressed out here, but stealing medical supplies is low.
TTW00001105	Knew those ghouls were up to no good. Look where it got us.
TTW00001106	How about you just do nice things for us. We liked those.
TTW00001107	I'm glad that I could start working here again, things were rough with those convicts in town.
TTW00001108	It's important that you're relaxed for this next test. Please, have a seat.
TTW00001109	All right. I'm gonna say a word. I want you to say the first thing that comes to mind.
TTW00001110	Dog.
TTW00001111	Here. These are yours. Was all you had on you when you was brought in.
TTW00001112	I hope you don't mind but I gave the note a look. I thought it might help me find a next of kin. But it was just something about a platinum chip.
TTW00001113	Here. These are yours. Was all you had on you when you was brought in.
TTW00001114	I hope you don't mind but I gave the note a look. I thought it might help me find a next of kin. But it was just something about a platinum chip.
TTW00001115	Why did you do that? They were going to let us walk away. Why did you attack them?
TTW00001116	I don't care that they started it. What you did was inexcusable. You need to go.
TTW00001117	Clearly you're determined to fight the Brotherhood. Well, you can add my name to your hit list because you're on your own.
TTW00001118	Sorry, sir, that's all the support I can spare today.
TTW00001119	Get you a drink?
TTW00001120	Wish more people had your kind of guts.
TTW00001121	You and me we're done traveling together. I want nothing more to do with you.
TTW00001122	Guess my last warning didn't sink in too well. Things don't change, and soon, I'm gone.
TTW00001123	You are such an asshole sometimes.
TTW00001124	Look, maybe you were like this before I signed up with you, but if you keep acting this way, I'm not going to stick around much longer.
TTW00001125	Farber is doing the best with what he's got, but man could I go for a nice cut of brahmin steak.
TTW00001126	Good thing I got stationed here and not at the Dam. I got connections because Major Dhatri's daughter married my nephew.
TTW00001127	Yeah?
TTW00001128	What the fuck are you looking at?
TTW00001129	Securitrons with faces like soldiers? Is this martial law or something? What the fuck?
TTW00001130	The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
TTW00001131	Caesar's dead. So when do we go home?
TTW00001132	Legion just came out of nowhere.
TTW00001133	I like you! Will you take Barnabas Bear to New Vegas when you go?
TTW00001134	With Forlorn Hope's fall, our blades are at the NCR's throat.
TTW00001135	That we hold Nelson, that is Caesar's will.
TTW00001136	Move along, buddy. I have work to do.
TTW00001137	You're a woman, and yet you wander free?
TTW00001138	It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
TTW00001139	Some of the slaves have been spreading stories about the Burned Man again.
TTW00001140	They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
TTW00001141	Who would have thought a place like this would exist?
TTW00001142	If you're looking to join up, head on by the Embassy.
TTW00001143	Strip secure.
TTW00001144	I've never heard of anyone breaking their contract and still getting their pay. Janet is damn lucky.
TTW00001145	I'm not sure I'll ever learn everything there is to know about this place.
TTW00001146	Our victory was never in question.
TTW00001147	Mike Lawson sure knows his way around the dam.
TTW00001148	The NCR is going to be grateful to have us around when the shooting starts.
TTW00001149	Hanlon is pretty legendary. People talk about what he did at the first battle of Hoover Dam with awe and respect.
TTW00001150	Private Watson sure seemed excited about meeting Kimball.
TTW00001151	I miss California.
TTW00001152	First Recon is holding Forlorn Hope now. What I wouldn't give for sniper support here.
TTW00001153	We're supposed to be relieved any day. That's what they keep telling us. I don't think anyone's coming.
TTW00001154	It was only a matter of time before HELIOS fell to us.
TTW00001155	Under NCR control, this place was a gun in the hands of a child.
TTW00001156	Sorry, pardner, if you're heading for the penthouse, you gotta go alone.
TTW00001157	;
TTW00001158	I told you I wouldn't work against the NCR. I meant it.
TTW00001159	I'm out of here.
TTW00001160	Still helping the Legion. You're gonna get what's coming to you. I promise you that.
TTW00001161	We're through working together.
TTW00001162	I can't believe Pearl let you stay with us.
TTW00001163	I bet you'd make an awesome Boomer.
TTW00001164	Yay! I love my new toy!
TTW00001165	Just try pulling some of your Brahmin shit here at the Dorado and see what happens.
TTW00001166	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
TTW00001167	Not now, I'm busy.
TTW00001168	Well howdy, pardner! You made it out of Goodsprings no worse for the wear. Good for you.
TTW00001169	We tolerate Wasteland savages, as long as they respect our rule around here.
TTW00001170	Anything new happening?
TTW00001171	The Strip ain't nothing but a monster. Chews folks up, sucks out their caps, and spits 'em back out.
TTW00001172	I can't wait to see the Strip. I hear it's so beautiful!
TTW00001173	Don't make any trouble for us, we won't make any trouble for you.
TTW00001174	A friend of mine at the Dam says President Kimball might visit the troops out there. Imagine shaking the president's hand!
TTW00001175	I only work for caravans, all right? Try someone else.
TTW00001176	People all scared of those robots on the Strip since they changed. Like who needs the Strip anyway?
TTW00001177	The food here is to die for. No one cooks Brahmin like Philippe.
TTW00001178	Any word as to our arrangement?
TTW00001179	How may I be of service, sir?
TTW00001180	How may I be of service, madam?
TTW00001181	Our executive chef Philippe is the toast of New Vegas. His Brahmin Wellington is absolutely sublime.
TTW00001182	Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
TTW00001183	You did a super job wrapping things up! And I'm not just saying that because I have to!
TTW00001184	So that's what I'm going to be doing, and it's going to take me a while, so it'll seem like I'm off-line. But don't worry, everything will be okay!
TTW00001185	I've updated the Securitrons' targeting parameters, so they know what to do! Vegas will be protected!
TTW00001186	We accomplished a lot together! It was fun! Take care!
TTW00001187	I bet I'm going to like it in that mainframe!
TTW00001188	I have a good feeling about this! It's going to be great!
TTW00001189	Hi! Nice to see you again!
TTW00001190	That'll activate a certain army of Securitrons and set them loose to ravage the Legion! What do you say?
TTW00001191	You did a super job wrapping things up! And I'm not just saying that because I have to!
TTW00001192	Some of the machinery's frozen up. Need someone to take a look at it.
TTW00001193	The Kings say they're keeping the peace, but this place is as violent as ever.
TTW00001194	Hey there, you want to cruise Freeside in style, you'd do worse than hire a King to tag along. Only 100 caps.
TTW00001195	Can I help you?
TTW00001196	Have you ever considered getting your head checked?
TTW00001197	We don't specialize in psychiatry in this camp.
TTW00001198	Welcome.
TTW00001199	Great to see you again.
TTW00001200	I'm busy, make it quick.
TTW00001201	Hello! The gasser everyone's been talking about, making a splash on the Strip. That's been you? Oh shit.
TTW00001202	Hello! It was you, smashed up the Omertas? You did that? Shit.
TTW00001203	Good job making it through that simulation. All you have to do now is open the Armory.
TTW00001204	And, as agreed, you get your share. Feel free to take whatever you want. If our records are right, there's plenty for all of us.
TTW00001205	It's been an honor working with you. I don't think I've ever seen bravery like that on any battlefield.
TTW00001206	Hopefully, after we mop up the mess in Anchorage, we can get together and have a couple of beers.
TTW00001207	Stay safe, soldier.
TTW00001208	The simulation has concluded, soldier.
TTW00001209	Thanks. Look, I've got to get back to HQ. I Found some papers before I got caught. Good hunting!
TTW00001210	Goddamn Commies caught me with my pants down. Don't tell anyone you found me like this, all right?
TTW00001211	They took us by surprise. I was the lucky one. Thanks for the rescue!
TTW00001212	Thank God! I thought I was a goner.
TTW00001213	Am I glad to see you!
TTW00001214	This is as far as I can go. It's up to you from here on out.
TTW00001215	If you dress up like a slave, you should be able to get past the gates without a problem.
TTW00001216	Once you're inside, find a slave named Midea. She'll be able to help you.
TTW00001217	Remember: your goal is to get access to Ashur and find the cure. After you have it, I'll contact you.
TTW00001218	Before we go, there's one last thing.
TTW00001219	Head into The Pitt and find the cure. Remember: put the slave clothes on and stash your stuff if you can.
TTW00001220	PLAYER SWING MELEE WEAPON
TTW00001221	Watch where you're swinging that, will you?
TTW00001222	Is that really necessary?
TTW00001223	Hey, knock it off.
TTW00001224	Why don't you go swing that somewhere else?
TTW00001225	Careful with that.
TTW00001226	Stop doing that so close to me.
TTW00001227	Neat. What else you got?
TTW00001228	Watch it, will you?
TTW00001229	PLAYER THROW GRENADE
TTW00001230	Look out!
TTW00001231	Grenah!
TTW00001232	Boomb!
TTW00001233	Nih mah sih!
TTW00001234	Bahm buh!
TTW00001235	Out of the way!
TTW00001236	Hot potato!
TTW00001237	Scoot!
TTW00001238	Hop to it!
TTW00001239	Watch out!
TTW00001240	Scatter!
TTW00001241	Get down!
TTW00001242	Here it comes!
TTW00001243	Here comes the boom!
TTW00001244	Run!
TTW00001245	Get away!
TTW00001246	Grenade!
TTW00001247	Hit the dirt!
TTW00001248	Take cover!
TTW00001249	Watch out!
TTW00001250	Look out!
TTW00001251	What are you doing?
TTW00001252	Grenade!
TTW00001253	Grenade!
TTW00001254	Take cover!
TTW00001255	Look out!
TTW00001256	Grenahoo!
TTW00001257	Grenade!
TTW00001258	Grenade!
TTW00001259	Whoa, whoa! Careful!
TTW00001260	Hey, knock it off!
TTW00001261	Watch it!
TTW00001262	Not so close!
TTW00001263	I hope you know what you're doing.
TTW00001264	Cut it out, will you?
TTW00001265	Do that someplace else!
TTW00001266	You tryin' to get me killed?
TTW00001267	Holster that. And be quick about it.
TTW00001268	Holster your iron, pardner!
TTW00001269	Quit it!
TTW00001270	Stop that!
TTW00001271	Hey! Do that somewhere else.
TTW00001272	Be careful!
TTW00001273	What in tarnation?
TTW00001274	What in blazes?
TTW00001275	Ammo costs money, you know!
TTW00001276	What's wrong with you?
TTW00001277	Knock it off!
TTW00001278	Quit fuckin' around!
TTW00001279	Keep that shit away from me.
TTW00001280	What the fuck do you think you're doing.
TTW00001281	Stop that! Someone could get hurt.
TTW00001282	No discarge armoos!
TTW00001283	Cool. Can I try?
TTW00001284	Whoa, whoa! Careful!
TTW00001285	I hope you know what you're doing.
TTW00001286	Whoa now. Be careful with that thing.
TTW00001287	You know what you're doing there?
TTW00001288	Whoa now. Be careful with that thing.
TTW00001289	Don't blow yourself up, okay?
TTW00001290	You sure that's a good idea?
TTW00001291	I hope you know what you're doing.
TTW00001292	I hope I don't forget that's there.
TTW00001293	Hard for me to step lightly with a bum leg.
TTW00001294	Now why in tarnation would you put one of those, there.
TTW00001295	Guess we best watch where we step.
TTW00001296	You sure that's necessary?
TTW00001297	What was the point of that?
TTW00001298	What the hell? That's dangerous.
TTW00001299	Um... why are you setting that there?
TTW00001300	That'll show 'em!
TTW00001301	Got any more of those?
TTW00001302	Hey, you dropped something.
TTW00001303	Isn't that a little overkill?
TTW00001304	Why the fuck you puttin' that there?
TTW00001305	Pick that back up or you'll be eatin' it.
TTW00001306	What are you doing?
TTW00001307	I saw that.
TTW00001308	Ah del tahi, bahm buh, ya?
TTW00001309	A bil he neh fuhr jahd thli gai! Heh he!
TTW00001310	I see what you're doing.
TTW00001311	I trust you know what you're doing.
TTW00001312	Por ke katu pongwa estee?
TTW00001313	Careful with that.
TTW00001314	Can't wait to see where this is going.
TTW00001315	Careful. Someone could trip on that.
TTW00001316	You think that firecracker will be enough?
TTW00001317	Oh come on. Cut it out.
TTW00001318	Put that down, will you?
TTW00001319	Give it a rest, will you?
TTW00001320	Is that really necessary?
TTW00001321	Are you having fun with that?
TTW00001322	You're easily amused, eh?
TTW00001323	You're kind of weird.
TTW00001324	Is that really necessary?
TTW00001325	Getting some exercise, are we?
TTW00001326	Watch it, will you?
TTW00001327	Oh come on. Pay more attention to what you're doing.
TTW00001328	Cut it out.
TTW00001329	Hey, be more careful!
TTW00001330	Why don't you look where you're going?
TTW00001331	What's the big idea?
TTW00001332	Watch where you're going.
TTW00001333	The molerat men! They've come for my beard at last! Oh. Never mind.
TTW00001334	Don't point that thing at me.
TTW00001335	Hey, knock it off.
TTW00001336	What do you think you're doing?
TTW00001337	Be careful with that!
TTW00001338	That's not a good idea.
TTW00001339	Easy there.
TTW00001340	How about you line that up on a tin can instead?
TTW00001341	Don't even kid about that.
TTW00001342	You're lookin' at a heap of trouble if you want it.
TTW00001343	If you think you want trouble, then let fly.
TTW00001344	Don't even joke like that.
TTW00001345	Point that somewhere else!
TTW00001346	That safety better be on.
TTW00001347	Point that somewhere else.
TTW00001348	For pete's sake...
TTW00001349	No respect.
TTW00001350	Stop that. I mean it!
TTW00001351	Quit it. You're making me nervous.
TTW00001352	Go ahead. Try me.
TTW00001353	Think you're tough, huh?
TTW00001354	Who the fuck do you think you are?
TTW00001355	Point that shit somewhere else.
TTW00001356	No tsaig tuh beh dah a hih jih gahni a meer.
TTW00001357	Stahp dahs pleez.
TTW00001358	Now's not really the time for that, is it?
TTW00001359	Subai thah, tsahh.
TTW00001360	Baje ka armoo.
TTW00001361	Hey, I can almost see right down the barrel!
TTW00001362	What do you think you're doing?
TTW00001363	Be more careful, will you?
TTW00001364	HELLO
TTW00001365	Hey, stranger. C'mon over here, I'd like to talk to you about something.
TTW00001366	Why are you still here? Go!
TTW00001367	Are you crazy? Get out of here!
TTW00001368	Don't be fooled by them!
TTW00001369	<yawns> I could use a nap.
TTW00001370	It's a fine day, isn't it?
TTW00001371	Glorious day, isn't it?
TTW00001372	Well, hello there!
TTW00001373	Good to see you!
TTW00001374	Welcome to Andale!
TTW00001375	The good Lord made Andale for days like today.
TTW00001376	<humming a tune>
TTW00001377	Don't you have a component to deliver?
TTW00001378	Where is this damn place?
TTW00001379	I swear it was this way!
TTW00001380	What's going on in here, Midea? Who is this scab?
TTW00001381	What's your problem?
TTW00001382	You're funny looking.
TTW00001383	Are you talking to me?
TTW00001384	Um. Yeah. Please go away.
TTW00001385	Howdy mister.
TTW00001386	Hi there, miss.
TTW00001387	Hi. How are you today?
TTW00001388	Have a nice day.
TTW00001389	Hello, sir.
TTW00001390	Hello, ma'am.
TTW00001391	Move along, please.
TTW00001392	How may I serve you, master?
TTW00001393	How may I serve you, mistress?
TTW00001394	Another glorious day in this man's army!
TTW00001395	Oh, great. Just what we need.
TTW00001396	Keep moving, local.
TTW00001397	Nothing to report, soldier.
TTW00001398	Glad you could join the party!
TTW00001399	Nice to see a friendly faceplate.
TTW00001400	All clear, sir.
TTW00001401	Good to have reinforcements.
TTW00001402	Don't think I recognize your unit. Must be a new convert from old man Lyons.
TTW00001403	Watch it, local.
TTW00001404	If you're here to help, fine. Otherwise, out of my way.
TTW00001405	Shouldn't you be huddling in a cave somewhere?
TTW00001406	What are you doing here?
TTW00001407	Great, another local.
TTW00001408	Keep your distance, mutt. No knowing what you've got breeding on you.
TTW00001409	Hello.
TTW00001410	Hello.
TTW00001411	...
TTW00001412	I've got the best whores in the Wasteland. The two of them are going to break my bed springs some day. Hah ha!
TTW00001413	Aren't my party girls sweet? I just want to eat them like candy. Ha ha!
TTW00001414	I don't have my Cherry pie any more. That bitch ran away.
TTW00001415	My women are dead. I'm gonna have to get me some new ones.
TTW00001416	Stay strong.
TTW00001417	We are the law.
TTW00001418	Stay on the right side of the law.
TTW00001419	Always good to see a new face in the fight.
TTW00001420	You should talk to Sonora.
TTW00001421	Come on, let me loose!
TTW00001422	Time to go yet?
TTW00001423	Great, here's some of the local wildlife.
TTW00001424	Back off, local.
TTW00001425	You're not involved in this. You want to keep it that way.
TTW00001426	Good to see you're holding up alright.
TTW00001427	Watch your back and keep your batteries dry out there.
TTW00001428	Run while you can!
TTW00001429	Tsk. To think you could have been rich. And now all you'll be is sorry. VERY sorry.
TTW00001430	I would advise staying clear of me for awhile. A LONG while.
TTW00001431	Tell me. Do you have a death wish?
TTW00001432	It was a wonderful thing you did. Inspirational. Truly.
TTW00001433	Yes friend? Is there something I can assist you with?
TTW00001434	Thanks again for you part in paving the way towards progress.
TTW00001435	Boy do I breathe a lot easier knowing that thing is truly dead!
TTW00001436	Mighty fine thing you did for this town.
TTW00001437	Hey friend!
TTW00001438	Welcome back.
TTW00001439	Nice work in there, soldier.
TTW00001440	Old games are no match for us Outcasts, huh?
TTW00001441	You did us proud in there.
TTW00001442	Good work, for a local.
TTW00001443	Never would have thought a savage could do it.
TTW00001444	Thanks, I guess.
TTW00001445	The U.S. Army needs more soldiers like you. Carry on.
TTW00001446	Let's wrap this thing up, soldier. We're cold, we're tired and we want our goddamn oil back!
TTW00001447	Damn Chinese Communists are stomping all over us. Time for us to pay them back.
TTW00001448	I think it's time to show those Red bastards what the U.S. Army is all about.
TTW00001449	You're doing a man's job, soldier. Keep it up!
TTW00001450	Carry on, soldier.
TTW00001451	You are in the presence of ant royalty!
TTW00001452	Well hello there, sweeheart.
TTW00001453	Hello there, Junior.
TTW00001454	Hello there, Junior, sweetheart. It's a lovely day, isn't it?
TTW00001455	Welcome to the Capital Preservation Society!
TTW00001456	Casdin said you're clear.
TTW00001457	Stay in line, and you'll be okay.
TTW00001458	Don't start anything and you'll be fine. Um, probably.
TTW00001459	Keep that tech coming, and we'll make it worth your while.
TTW00001460	You'll, uh, um, need help with the barricades soon, right Pappy?
TTW00001461	Kimba, um, I heard you helped bandage me up when I was on the table. Uh, thank you.
TTW00001462	I was thinking of hitting patrol again soon, Flash.
TTW00001463	Hey Sticky, um, uh, what do you think of Big Town?
TTW00001464	I wonder if someone should work on the barricades again.
TTW00001465	Hey, Red, can I stop by the clinic later? You know, just in case?
TTW00001466	Hey, Flash. Patrolling sounds like a lot of fun. Maybe I could come out with you.
TTW00001467	Do you have any idea of what I can do in town, Shorty?
TTW00001468	Hey there, Pappy. I was out trying to gather food. Did you know there's not much food out here in the Wastes?
TTW00001469	Hey there, Kimba. Is there anything I can do around town?
TTW00001470	Hey, Red. Is there anything I can do around town to help out?
TTW00001471	Sticky, it's about time you learned that I'm in charge here.
TTW00001472	I don't like the looks of the barricades, Pappy. Why don't you redo them?
TTW00001473	Timebomb, since you insist on staying alive, why don't you make yourself useful and help me reset the barricades.
TTW00001474	You don't go far out enough on your patrol, Flash. A real patrol would cover a solid half-mile radius.
TTW00001475	I'm telling you, Red, just let me run everything. I'll get those barricades twice as high!
TTW00001476	Bittercup, make sure you're paying attention out on patrol. There are dangerous people out there.
TTW00001477	Hey, Flash. How are you feeling? Any calluses from stroking that new gun of yours?
TTW00001478	How are you feeling, Timebomb? Are those stitches holding together?
TTW00001479	There's my Sticky! How are you doing?
TTW00001480	Hey, Pappy. How's that wound on your arm?
TTW00001481	Shorty, I want to gather everyone together soon about setting up the barricades higher. I'd really appreciate your, uh, expertise.
TTW00001482	Excuse me.
TTW00001483	Got a minute?
TTW00001484	Looks like something's on your mind, Lucy.
TTW00001485	What's bothering you, Penny?
TTW00001486	Care to talk?
TTW00001487	Hey, Zip. Come over here.
TTW00001488	Finding your way about all right?
TTW00001489	Hail.
TTW00001490	Hail.
TTW00001491	Hail.
TTW00001492	Presence detected. This unit has activated.
TTW00001493	Hail.
TTW00001494	Hail.
TTW00001495	Hail.
TTW00001496	Hail.
TTW00001497	Ahzrukhal, boy, I want to talk to you.
TTW00001498	We owe you so much. The Memorial will be a beacon for slaves everywhere.
TTW00001499	Everyone is grateful for what you've done for us.
TTW00001500	The Slavers will have some goddamn respect for now, huh?
TTW00001501	It's going to take a lot of work to repair the Memorial. Thanks to you, I'll get to do it.
TTW00001502	You're a hero to everyone here, sir.
TTW00001503	You're a hero to everyone here, ma'am.
TTW00001504	Please have your password ready.
TTW00001505	Hello, dear. Hope you're not spending all your time working.
TTW00001506	We never seem to have any alone time anymore.
TTW00001507	Well, if it isn't our fearless champion.
TTW00001508	What is it? I'm a little busy right now.
TTW00001509	Nice work cleaning up the town.
TTW00001510	Town's a lot safer now. Thanks.
TTW00001511	Aw, you made this place get so boring.
TTW00001512	Nothing new, sir.
TTW00001513	Sir, people are mostly staying quiet.
TTW00001514	Who do we have here?
TTW00001515	Humph.
TTW00001516	I suppose the dog's coming with us, yes?
TTW00001517	Father and son, side by side. This is the way it should be.
TTW00001518	My God, can you believe the devastation out here? That's why our work is so important.
TTW00001519	I'm glad I've got you watching my back. I'm not quite sure I'm cut out for all this excitement. Not anymore.
TTW00001520	Come on, let's keep moving.
TTW00001521	Not much farther. We'll be at Rivet City before you know it.
TTW00001522	Don't do this. Please tell me the code.
TTW00001523	Keep moving!
TTW00001524	Get inside!
TTW00001525	Head for the Control Room.
TTW00001526	What do you want?
TTW00001527	Stay away from me! I don't want whatever you smoothskins are infecting us with!
TTW00001528	Almost there!
TTW00001529	Is it safe yet?
TTW00001530	You have my vote, Mister President.
TTW00001531	That election is getting pretty close, huh?
TTW00001532	Who are you going to vote for, Bob?
TTW00001533	Hey Jessica, you excited about the election?
TTW00001534	Hey Shawna, did you do the early voting?
TTW00001535	Isn't election time so much fun, Mary?
TTW00001536	Rachael, can you believe you're almost old enough to vote?
TTW00001537	Who would you vote for if you were old enough, Flower?
TTW00001538	Don't you just love election time, Ralph?
TTW00001539	Hello Mister President.
TTW00001540	Hi, Mister President.
TTW00001541	How's my first lady doing today?
TTW00001542	Hi Mary. I mean Flower. Rachael!
TTW00001543	Rachael, come play with me!
TTW00001544	Lookin's free, the rest will cost ya.
TTW00001545	Got something on your mind?
TTW00001546	Don't look at me like that.
TTW00001547	Got a problem?
TTW00001548	Welcome to Moriarty's Saloon.
TTW00001549	Looking for a drink? You've come to the right place.
TTW00001550	S'matter? Never seen a Ghoul before?
TTW00001551	Yeah, what the hell do you want?
TTW00001552	You want something or you just looking to get your ass beat?
TTW00001553	This better be important. I'm a busy man.
TTW00001554	So, what is it now?
TTW00001555	If you need something from me, spill it.
TTW00001556	I owe you Follower people a beer for patching me up a while back.
TTW00001557	Hey, isn't that the King's dog?
TTW00001558	Looking to make a trade?
TTW00001559	Searching for that special something?
TTW00001560	Trading caps for crap, step right up!
TTW00001561	Got some junk to unload? I'm buying!
TTW00001562	Welcome, friend. Looking for more appropriate attire?
TTW00001563	The spirits told me you'd be coming. And that you're looking to buy.
TTW00001564	Here for a pick-me-up?
TTW00001565	If you've got the caps, I've got your fix.
TTW00001566	Here to pick up a few of my marvelous toys?
TTW00001567	Fear not, for Lucky Harith is here to offer you protection for a price!
TTW00001568	Hello, there!
TTW00001569	How do?
TTW00001570	Morning, sleepyhead! Sleep well, boy?
TTW00001571	Rise and shine! How was your night, my boy?
TTW00001572	Watch your step, sister.
TTW00001573	I've never seen a ghoul up close. Not sure I wanted to.
TTW00001574	Make my day, mutant.
TTW00001575	Whatever you're selling, we have plenty.
TTW00001576	Once a republican, always a republican.
TTW00001577	You aren't stealing our medicine, are you, doc?
TTW00001578	I can take care of that robot problem for you. Just saying.
TTW00001579	If you can't keep that thing under control, I will.
TTW00001580	What's up?
TTW00001581	Ave.
TTW00001582	Ave.
TTW00001583	Ave.
TTW00001584	Ave.
TTW00001585	Thanks for talking us out of our evil ways. I'm starting on that novel soon. Pauline is so happy. You are a nice person! Hurray!
TTW00001586	Sammy and I are grateful. We are going to follow our dreams.
TTW00001587	Hello.
TTW00001588	We need to talk.
TTW00001589	Welcome to Tenpenny Tower.
TTW00001590	Ah, hello!
TTW00001591	Nice to see you. Doing well, I hope?
TTW00001592	And how are you this fine day?
TTW00001593	How are you?
TTW00001594	How are things?
TTW00001595	Hey there.
TTW00001596	Yes?
TTW00001597	Good to see you.
TTW00001598	Hey.
TTW00001599	Morning.
TTW00001600	Evening.
TTW00001601	Evening.
TTW00001602	Morning.
TTW00001603	Hey.
TTW00001604	Begone from this place, blasphemer!
TTW00001605	You're no longer welcome here.
TTW00001606	Oasis is no longer a refuge for you, Outsider.
TTW00001607	Can I help you, Sheriff?
TTW00001608	I don't know why RJ's letting you back in, but if you touch any of my kids, I'll make sure you never have any of your own.
TTW00001609	Remember my offer, Outsider: cash for Pre-War books.
TTW00001610	If you have any Pre-War books, I'll take them.
TTW00001611	We've gotta get out of here.
TTW00001612	I sure hope we don't get caught!
TTW00001613	Anything I can help with?
TTW00001614	I can't get off this ship fast enough.
TTW00001615	At least I'm still in one piece...
TTW00001616	Is everything okay?
TTW00001617	<mumbles to himself>
TTW00001618	<mumbles to himself>
TTW00001619	<mumbles to himself>
TTW00001620	Our business is at an end. Leave this place.
TTW00001621	You should have seen this place thirty years ago.
TTW00001622	Did you want to talk? I won't bite.
TTW00001623	You findin' your way around, sweetie?
TTW00001624	Welcome aboard!
TTW00001625	I need your help!
TTW00001626	<Whistling tunelessly.>
TTW00001627	Step right up.
TTW00001628	Mines help, if you got 'em.
TTW00001629	Warmest regards.
TTW00001630	Looking to travel?
TTW00001631	Empty your thoughts, child.
TTW00001632	The physical world holds nothing for us. Release any lingering connections to it.
TTW00001633	Embrace the simple things in life.
TTW00001634	Submerge your will in the depths of the astral sea!
TTW00001635	I'm watching you, child.
TTW00001636	New girl, you try too hard. Be calm.
TTW00001637	Good to see you still here, my child.
TTW00001638	No offense, but I don't want whatever's going around. So just keep your distance, okay?
TTW00001639	If you feel you're getting sick, quarantine yourself at the clinic, immediately.
TTW00001640	Everything should be in place by now. Even if they know we're coming, it won't matter.
TTW00001641	It's good to see you again.
TTW00001642	Scribe Rothchild is going to need an update on your progress. Have you sent a report recently?
TTW00001643	Ahem.
TTW00001644	Bigsley could really cut us some slack.
TTW00001645	What the hell are we doing here, really? We have better things to do.
TTW00001646	The mercenary caravan has returned. They ran into some trouble - Sir? Scribe Bigsley? Is everything alright, sir?
TTW00001647	I don't know why they don't just build a pipeline. Schlepping bottles of water back and forth is the worst kind of stupid.
TTW00001648	Shh. If you spook the lurks I'll never get out of here.
TTW00001649	The lurks get real shy when they're sick. You gotta wait for 'em to poke their noses up.
TTW00001650	Are you really going to fight in the Hole?
TTW00001651	Ashur's looking forward to meeting you, champ.
TTW00001652	Hurry over to Haven, kid.
TTW00001653	Off to talk with Ashur? Lucky you.
TTW00001654	It's about time we had a talk.
TTW00001655	Die, you bastard!
TTW00001656	You got a funny look on your face. You got something you wanna say?
TTW00001657	Having a good time?
TTW00001658	Scram, before I mess your face up bad as mine.
TTW00001659	Do I look like your personal assistant?
TTW00001660	Another fine day in The Pitt, huh?
TTW00001661	Can't seem to get enough sleep, these days.
TTW00001662	Don't you have something you should be doing?
TTW00001663	Keeping busy, meat?
TTW00001664	Mind your own business, nebby.
TTW00001665	You want something?
TTW00001666	Back to work, you.
TTW00001667	WHAT?
TTW00001668	That's one way to get out of work, isn't it? Ha!
TTW00001669	Stop staring, newbie.
TTW00001670	Aww, such a sweet face. Get back to work.
TTW00001671	Hey, sexy.
TTW00001672	Man, the scabs ain't half as feisty as that last batch. At least when they fight back I get some fuckin' exercise.
TTW00001673	There's my super-assistant! What's up?
TTW00001674	Did you hear about those newbies? The ones who went up north lookin' for raids?
TTW00001675	Yo.
TTW00001676	May I take your order?
TTW00001677	I'll be right with you.
TTW00001678	The Mirelurks have been quiet lately.
TTW00001679	I'll have two Mirelurk Cakes, carrots and wine, if you have it, beer if you don't.
TTW00001680	Welcome to Potomac Attire.
TTW00001681	Hmmph.
TTW00001682	What?
TTW00001683	This is the Muddy Rudder. Cause any trouble, and you'll have to deal with me.
TTW00001684	Care for a drink?
TTW00001685	Oh! Hello. Are you lost?
TTW00001686	Welcome to A Quick Fix.
TTW00001687	Did you need something?
TTW00001688	Excuse me.
TTW00001689	You're hurt. Fortunately, this is a medical clinic. Why don't you let me take a look at that.
TTW00001690	Welcome to Flak and Shrapnel's. Best god damn weapons anywhere.
TTW00001691	Have a seat anywhere. Someone will be with you in a minute.
TTW00001692	Yes?
TTW00001693	Don't mind me, mister.
TTW00001694	Don't mind me, lady.
TTW00001695	This is A Quick Fix. We sell all kinds of chems.
TTW00001696	Hello, Bannon. Anything interesting happen in the last council meeting?
TTW00001697	Hello, Henry. I just got in some new torque wrench and some electrical test equipment. You should take a look at them when you're done eating.
TTW00001698	Welcome to Rivet City Supply. I've got a little bit of everything here.
TTW00001699	If you want a gun, you've come to the right place.
TTW00001700	Have you seen my good-for-nothing son, James?
TTW00001701	Hey stranger. Wanna buy a girl a drink?
TTW00001702	Can you spare enough for a drink? I could really use one.
TTW00001703	Welcome to the Weatherly Hotel.
TTW00001704	Wastelander.
TTW00001705	Everything looks okay here.
TTW00001706	Any trouble in this area?
TTW00001707	I'm looking for troublemakers. Have you seen any?
TTW00001708	Out of the way you rust bucket.
TTW00001709	I heard that the City Council is debating putting railings on the flight deck.
TTW00001710	Chief Harkness has vanished. Nobody knows what happened to him.
TTW00001711	Hey.
TTW00001712	Sir.
TTW00001713	Ma'am.
TTW00001714	Attention! Officer on deck.
TTW00001715	Authorized Civilian. Proceed.
TTW00001716	Hey Kimba, thanks for offering to help me in the clinic.
TTW00001717	How are you feeling, Timebomb?
TTW00001718	Hey there, Sticky.
TTW00001719	How are the patrols going, Flash? Are we still safe?
TTW00001720	Hey, Red. Do you need any help washing bandages later?
TTW00001721	Hey Shorty. How's our favorite little guy doing?
TTW00001722	How are you doing, Pappy?
TTW00001723	Hey, Sticky. Keep your stickiness away from me and my new gun. This is a Sticky-free zone!
TTW00001724	Timebomb! How're you doing? I thought you were dead for sure!
TTW00001725	Hey Shorty, you should come with me on patrol. The Raiders will never see you coming.
TTW00001726	Hey Red, can I stop by the clinic later? I feel a bit sick.
TTW00001727	Wow, you should have seen me on patrol, Kimba, I was all "bang-bang-bang." I must have killed a hundred Raiders!
TTW00001728	Red, have you got a sec? It’s about this wound on my arm.
TTW00001729	We're all going to die here. There's no way we can survive out here in this mess.
TTW00001730	Hey there, Kimba.
TTW00001731	What do you think of the barricades, Shorty?
TTW00001732	Hey, Timebomb. You look like you're going to fall over dead.
TTW00001733	Never thought you'd make it, Sticky. Out of everyone who died trying to get here from Lamplight, we get you.
TTW00001734	Anything out there, Flash? The Super Mutants and Raiders are coming back soon, aren't they?
TTW00001735	Hello, sugar.
TTW00001736	Are you still here?
TTW00001737	Are you planning on moving in, or what?
TTW00001738	I wish he'd get us some regular clothes. It's cold out here dressed like this.
TTW00001739	Please don't take Ian away from us.
TTW00001740	Hey hey, mungo! We're getting' outta here, right?
TTW00001741	Leave us and never look back, Outsider.
TTW00001742	We'll begin as soon as the rest of the Treeminders have taken their places.
TTW00001743	Yes, Outsider?
TTW00001744	Can I help you, Outsider?
TTW00001745	Is something amiss?
TTW00001746	I can't believe you're here!
TTW00001747	Gob. These people aren't nearly drunk enough. Fix it.
TTW00001748	Gob!
TTW00001749	I want a word with you, zombie.
TTW00001750	It's my turn!
TTW00001751	Nathan.
TTW00001752	Hey.
TTW00001753	Oh, oh! Mr. Ahzrukhal, I want to ask you something.
TTW00001754	Hey, robot, have you seen any toes laying around here?
TTW00001755	Cerberus! How are you? Programming holding up?
TTW00001756	Heya, Patches. You alright, buddy? You're not lookin' so good.
TTW00001757	Quinn, no one told me you were back!
TTW00001758	Hey, Quinn.
TTW00001759	Hey, Winthrop. How's it going?
TTW00001760	Heya, Winthrop. You got a second?
TTW00001761	How's everything? Enjoying your drinks?
TTW00001762	Yes, yes, how is everyone doing? Everything alright? Do you need anything else?
TTW00001763	The air is off in the common house again. It stinks of sweaty death down there. I swear, every day it's something new.
TTW00001764	There's my honey pie!
TTW00001765	Hi, Mrs. Smith!
TTW00001766	I love you, Mommy!
TTW00001767	My room is all clean, Mommy!
TTW00001768	Hello, Mr. Harris.
TTW00001769	Mommy says that it's almost time for dinner!
TTW00001770	I saw you napping, daddy!
TTW00001771	Hi there, daddy!
TTW00001772	Hi, Bill.
TTW00001773	Hello, Bill.
TTW00001774	You're going to love what I'm cooking tonight, dear!
TTW00001775	Hello, Jack.
TTW00001776	Hi, Jack.
TTW00001777	Uh oh, Jenny. Look at you. The boys better watch out!
TTW00001778	Hey there, Jenny, sweetheart. Looking gorgeous as usual.
TTW00001779	Hi there, honey. Don't you look precious today?
TTW00001780	Jenny, you look beautiful today! You're like a little doll!
TTW00001781	Jenny, honey, you look so cute in that dress.
TTW00001782	Evening! Get a lot of work done today, boy?
TTW00001783	How're you doing, boy? Is everything all right?
TTW00001784	Hello, Dom. Everyone behaving themselves?
TTW00001785	Dom. Any news I should be worried about?
TTW00001786	'Scuse me!
TTW00001787	Heya!
TTW00001788	Hey, Machete. You on guard? I mean, of course you are. I mean, umm, never mind.
TTW00001789	How's it going?
TTW00001790	Hey.
TTW00001791	Hey, Derek. You did some fine work out there with those Brahmin.
TTW00001792	Derek, been hearing good things about your work with the traders. Way to go, man.
TTW00001793	Eating right? Hope so.
TTW00001794	I got my eye on you.
TTW00001795	Hey, Machete. Report in. You see anything odd out there?
TTW00001796	Machete, what's the word from your watch?
TTW00001797	Hey, move.
TTW00001798	<snort>
TTW00001799	Hey, you.
TTW00001800	Um, can I ask something?
TTW00001801	Excuse me.
TTW00001802	Just bring me a nice kid to meet, and I'll take care of the rest.
TTW00001803	Hey, dummy.
TTW00001804	Hey, Sammy.
TTW00001805	Hey, squirt.
TTW00001806	Hey, heard the latest tales of the Wastes?
TTW00001807	So, bro, any luck trading today?
TTW00001808	Hey, sib!
TTW00001809	So, sis, crack anybody up today?
TTW00001810	So, sis, made any good jokes today?
TTW00001811	Wanna hear a story?
TTW00001812	What's up?
TTW00001813	Guess what?
TTW00001814	Mind if I follow you around for a bit? I promise not to bug you! It'll be fun!
TTW00001815	Oh, hey, excuse me, hey!
TTW00001816	Somebody said you wanted to see me, E?
TTW00001817	Joseph, what happens when a person grows up?
TTW00001818	Pardon me.
TTW00001819	Tell me more about shooting, Joseph.
TTW00001820	Excuse me.
TTW00001821	Look alive, you mopey motherfucker, you've got a mayor talking to you!
TTW00001822	Hey, Princess, give the squirt a fucking break and answer a few questions.
TTW00001823	Hey, Princess, if you aren't busy daydreaming about me, how about answering a few questions?
TTW00001824	Eclair, stop trying to make crap taste like sugar and tell me what's going on.
TTW00001825	Anybody break anything important, Lucy?
TTW00001826	Knock, what's up? And if you say "the sky" I swear I'm gonna kick you in the junk.
TTW00001827	Knick, anything new and fancy in your magic junkpile full of crap?
TTW00001828	Joe, anything useful you can teach me about how the classes are going?
TTW00001829	Well, if it isn't my favorite girl.
TTW00001830	Look alive!
TTW00001831	Lucy, can you take a look at this?
TTW00001832	George, have you spoken to your son about Old Lady Dithers?
TTW00001833	So, heard anything good from Mabel lately?
TTW00001834	How are you, Mabel?
TTW00001835	Hi, honey.
TTW00001836	Hi, Mommy.
TTW00001837	Hi, Daddy.
TTW00001838	Hi, Martha.
TTW00001839	Hello, Ms. Dithers.
TTW00001840	Hi, Mabel.
TTW00001841	Hi, Janet.
TTW00001842	Hi, Roger.
TTW00001843	Hi, Pat.
TTW00001844	Hi, George.
TTW00001845	[crying]
TTW00001846	Hiya.
TTW00001847	Hello!
TTW00001848	Good day.
TTW00001849	Welcome to my place.
TTW00001850	Do you need something?
TTW00001851	You gonna stare, or are you gonna order?
TTW00001852	What is it, human?
TTW00001853	<hic>
TTW00001854	Do you want to hear a story about the Wastes?
TTW00001855	You here to buy, or just looking around?
TTW00001856	I got work to do, so if you need something, spit it out.
TTW00001857	Don't mess with us, we won't mess with you.
TTW00001858	If you have any questions about the exhibits, please let me know.
TTW00001859	Do have a look around, but don't touch anything.
TTW00001860	We have the most complete archive of U.S. historical documents in the Wasteland.
TTW00001861	We should get out of here, don't you think?
TTW00001862	Overseer's glad to see everyone staying so calm down here.
TTW00001863	Glad to see you here.
TTW00001864	Good to see another rebel.
TTW00001865	Still representing the gang? Good to see, man.
TTW00001866	Good to see you here. Please keep quiet, you never know who's listening.
TTW00001867	Hi, Chrissie. Any stories from the weirdo dorm?
TTW00001868	Good to see you, Susie!
TTW00001869	Well, Stanley, how's everything going down in the reactor?
TTW00001870	Tunnel Snakes rule, huh?
TTW00001871	Man, I sure wish we could blow this joint.
TTW00001872	Please, be careful.
TTW00001873	I'm sorry. Goodbye.
TTW00001874	You've got to change the Overseer's mind.
TTW00001875	Sorry to see you go.
TTW00001876	Why won't you just leave us alone? You've done enough damage.
TTW00001877	You don't belong here anymore.
TTW00001878	It's good to see you again.
TTW00001879	Leave me alone.
TTW00001880	Go ahead and start something, I dare you.
TTW00001881	You're not going to ask me to hold your hand through this are you?
TTW00001882	Yes? Are you having trouble with your little assignment? Do I need to find someone else?
TTW00001883	I told you to go.
TTW00001884	Remember: cash for scrap metal.
TTW00001885	Whatever you can do to help our town, we'd appreciate it.
TTW00001886	We appreciate you taking care of our town's little problem.
TTW00001887	Any luck finding those two troublemakers, yet?
TTW00001888	When you find those two costumed idiots, put a bullet in their heads for me.
TTW00001889	Welcome to my clinic. If you're hurt, then you're in the right place.
TTW00001890	Hey there. Are you hurt?
TTW00001891	Here to help me out again?
TTW00001892	Four Score! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
TTW00001893	Good dog, Four Score. You love Bill just as he is, don't you? You don't go judging a man like them others.
TTW00001894	Hey, Four Score. I don't have time to play fetch today. Go bother Bill.
TTW00001895	Come, boy. If you're good today, I'll give you a treat.
TTW00001896	Out of my way, mutt.
TTW00001897	Hey, clown shoes. I hope that key was worth it.
TTW00001898	Too bad about Crowley. I heard Tenpenny put out a contract on him.
TTW00001899	Tag! You're it, Ralphie!
TTW00001900	Come on Mary, let's go play!
TTW00001901	Hello Rosie.
TTW00001902	Excuse you.
TTW00001903	Hey, go clean up after the Brahmin. It's your turn.
TTW00001904	Man, the Brahmin smell awful today.
TTW00001905	Have you heard about Dave, lady?
TTW00001906	Have you heard about Dave, mister?
TTW00001907	You're almost as big as Dave.
TTW00001908	Hi there, honey. Have you spoken to Dave?
TTW00001909	Elder on deck!
TTW00001910	Initiate reporting, Sir Dusk!
TTW00001911	Knight Captain Dusk, Sir!
TTW00001912	Damn robot. Worst bedside manner ever.
TTW00001913	Scribe Bowditch, I trust you are well. I'm here for your progress report on the modified Recon Armor.
TTW00001914	Hail, Scribe Bowditch. All is well with your work?
TTW00001915	Hail to you, Scribe Bowditch.
TTW00001916	Hail, Scribe Peabody. I trust that your research goes well.
TTW00001917	Sir Scribe.
TTW00001918	Sentinel Lyons, ma'am!
TTW00001919	Need something, friend?
TTW00001920	Hail.
TTW00001921	<sniffs>You smell like the Wasteland.
TTW00001922	Yeah, I guess I gotta find my own way.
TTW00001923	Psst. Hey. Help me out.
TTW00001924	Whoa, sorry! I'll get out of your way!
TTW00001925	Respect, man.
TTW00001926	Holy shit, it's you!
TTW00001927	We should grab a drink sometime.
TTW00001928	What's up, killer?
TTW00001929	Hey, welcome, buddy.
TTW00001930	You're not so bad from what I've heard.
TTW00001931	Heh. I've heard a few things about you.
TTW00001932	Watch it.
TTW00001933	We don't like outsiders here.
TTW00001934	Get your business done and go.
TTW00001935	One wrong move, and you're going in the meat pen.
TTW00001936	Watch your step, square.
TTW00001937	Keep walkin'.
TTW00001938	You don't look like you belong here.
TTW00001939	Goddamn tin can.
TTW00001940	Nice outfit. You raid a vault or something?
TTW00001941	Nice to see you. Carry on.
TTW00001942	Now's not the best time. Perhaps we could parlay sometime later? Thank you.
TTW00001943	I bet you exercise a lot, huh?
TTW00001944	Hi there! That's quite some ordnance you're packing, isn't it!
TTW00001945	If you're tired of sleeping in those barracks, let me know.
TTW00001946	I made it just like you like it. Enjoy!
TTW00001947	Chief. I'm concerned some of your men have been sleeping on the job. Well not literally, I just mean, they don't seem that alert.
TTW00001948	I'm afraid I can't stop and chit chat.
TTW00001949	I'm afraid I can't stop and chit chat.
TTW00001950	Hey.
TTW00001951	Whoa. Feel woozy.
TTW00001952	Sigh. This is a long way from the Statesman Hotel. Why are you still here?
TTW00001953	Why are you just standing around here? My men might be dying!
TTW00001954	You're still here?
TTW00001955	Are you all right, Madison?
TTW00001956	Janice, I have something for you.
TTW00001957	Janice, a moment please.
TTW00001958	Crime doesn't pay, it just pisses people off.
TTW00001959	Next time you want to talk to someone, stay away from me.
TTW00001960	Just make this fast. I don't like talking to criminals.
TTW00001961	There's a fine line between badass and dumbass, and you crossed it.
TTW00001962	Make no mistake. Try something and I drop your ass.
TTW00001963	We may be alike, but don't take me for stupid. I got my eyes on you.
TTW00001964	Keep acting the way you've been acting and they'll catch you, lock you up and throw away the key.
TTW00001965	I'm not sure I should even be seen talking to you.
TTW00001966	Oh, it's you. Up to the same old crap, huh?
TTW00001967	Sometimes being bad feels pretty damn good, eh?
TTW00001968	You should be ashamed of yourself.
TTW00001969	Next time, use your brains... I know you have it in you.
TTW00001970	What's the matter with you? You can't get away with crap like this.
TTW00001971	The way you're acting surprises me.
TTW00001972	Your bad deeds surprise me, they really do.
TTW00001973	Don't act like you didn't enjoy what you did.
TTW00001974	You're as guilty as the rest of us.
TTW00001975	We need more people like you.
TTW00001976	Bless you.
TTW00001977	You're an example to us all.
TTW00001978	It's not easy to be good in this world. I'm glad that someone is.
TTW00001979	I've heard about you. Let it never be said that there aren't some good people left in the world.
TTW00001980	There's never been anyone like you.
TTW00001981	Is everyone from the Vault as kind as you?
TTW00001982	Yeah?
TTW00001983	Just hold still. Your left stabilizer's been knocked loose.
TTW00001984	Don't be such an old woman. Just a few more adjustments and you'll be as good as new.
TTW00001985	Oh, hey there.
TTW00001986	Show us how smart you are, Wally. What should we call ourselves?
TTW00001987	Hey, Paul, your hobby's open. Whoa, that's your hobby? Ha ha ha ha! Now quick, give me an idea for what to name our gang.
TTW00001988	Ah man, you got a Pip-Boy. I wish I was ten.
TTW00001989	Fun party, huh?
TTW00001990	Thanks for coming. Are you having fun?
TTW00001991	Thanks for coming. It means a lot to both of us.
TTW00001992	Are you having a nice time?
TTW00001993	Have you heard about Freddie Gomez?
TTW00001994	You're a lowlife, but if you keep your nose clean, we'll let you stay.
TTW00001995	You watch yourself. You cause any more trouble and you'll be dead.
TTW00001996	Find him!
TTW00001997	Those Temple Union slaves got what they deserved.
TTW00001998	Dashwood. What the hell are you skulking about for?
TTW00001999	Hey! What are you up to old man?
TTW00002000	Ahem. Dashwood. Don't do anything stupid.
TTW00002001	You feeling alright, Daring? You having a flash back or something?
TTW00002002	You're behaving rather oddly, Mister Dashwood. Perhaps you should go lie down for awhile.
TTW00002003	Are you alright, Comrade?
TTW00002004	Daring! What on earth are you up to?
TTW00002005	You're up to something. I can tell.
TTW00002006	Daring! What the bloody hell are you up to this time?
TTW00002007	Mr. Dashwood. Perhaps you should go take a nap, dear. You're acting rather peculiar.
TTW00002008	What are you doing, Dashwood?
TTW00002009	There he is!
TTW00002010	There she is!
TTW00002011	'can I do for you, Sheriff?
TTW00002012	Dad says not to talk to strangers.
TTW00002013	Billy says not to talk to you.
TTW00002014	I got nothin' to say to you.
TTW00002015	You seen Nathan around anywhere?
TTW00002016	Yes?
TTW00002017	Hrm?
TTW00002018	Grouse.
TTW00002019	Ug. Get away from me.
TTW00002020	Richter.
TTW00002021	S'up, fool?
TTW00002022	Hey, you're back. You get anything good?
TTW00002023	You caught anything lately?
TTW00002024	How'd that roundup go?
TTW00002025	How's the meat?
TTW00002026	Hey, how'd it go with that blonde thing you brought in here?
TTW00002027	You went out with Ymir last week, didn't you? Catch anything good?
TTW00002028	Catch any good meat lately?
TTW00002029	Things are quiet around here. We haven't had any good roundups in a while.
TTW00002030	S'up.
TTW00002031	Hey.
TTW00002032	Hello, Elder.
TTW00002033	THE ONE WHO DEFENDED US FROM MOBIUS. HELLO.
TTW00002034	If it isn't the beautiful ping of my radar-scan picking up a heroic Lobotomite.
TTW00002035	-The ONE who SAVED us! To you, I bestow a hello. Hello.-
TTW00002036	*Thanks for helping us. Don't get a big head or anything, even if I am insanely jealous.*
TTW00002037	So nice seeing you again - for perhaps the first time.
TTW00002038	Hello.
TTW00002039	Hey.
TTW00002040	It appears you've been wounded, sir. May I suggest you utilize your infirmary?
TTW00002041	You appear to have been wounded, madame. May I suggest you utilize your infirmary?
TTW00002042	Run faster or I will throw you off the side.
TTW00002043	We've got stuff you never realized you needed.
TTW00002044	We've got competitive prices and a good inventory.
TTW00002045	Heh.
TTW00002046	How about some grub?
TTW00002047	I'm a busy man.
TTW00002048	You again?
TTW00002049	Scoot your boots, ya bum!
TTW00002050	Just try pulling some of your Brahmin shit here at the Dorado and see what happens.
TTW00002051	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
TTW00002052	Hey Rexie, who's a good dog?
TTW00002053	What are you looking at?
TTW00002054	Hello, cutie.
TTW00002055	What's a pretty girl like you doing with someone like this?
TTW00002056	You need a boyfriend, honey?
TTW00002057	You want to have some fun with a real man, baby?
TTW00002058	Want a massage, cutie? No charge.
TTW00002059	Buy you a drink, honey?
TTW00002060	Great, another fuckin' robot.
TTW00002061	Um, er, excuse me. I'll just get out of your way.
TTW00002062	Things are tense on the Strip right now. The head of one of Mr. House's Families was killed. Time to lay low, you ask me.
TTW00002063	Hey baby. Wanna get wild tonight?
TTW00002064	Hey, baby. I know a quiet place we can be alone. Or a loud place if you're one of those.
TTW00002065	You got something you want to say?
TTW00002066	Yeah?
TTW00002067	May I help you?
TTW00002068	Hey, what's up?
TTW00002069	Hey, pal.
TTW00002070	Hey, doll.
TTW00002071	Look who it is. Freeside's favorite son.
TTW00002072	Look who it is. Freeside's leading lady.
TTW00002073	Hey, it's good to see you.
TTW00002074	Hey there. You're the King's friend, right?
TTW00002075	You here to start trouble?
TTW00002076	You in the right neighborhood?
TTW00002077	I'd keep moving, if I were you.
TTW00002078	You know, I was just talking about trash, and here you are.
TTW00002079	Be advised, visitors will be held responsible for the behavior of any non-human sapients accompanying them.
TTW00002080	I am so happy to see you!
TTW00002081	Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
TTW00002082	Who would have thought a place like this would exist?
TTW00002083	What is it?
TTW00002084	Strip secure.
TTW00002085	Please don't kill me!
TTW00002086	With Caesar dead, maybe they'll stop attacking us.
TTW00002087	People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
TTW00002088	Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
TTW00002089	Dixon's hooch may be cheap, but it tastes like it was filtered through a dirty sock.
TTW00002090	Hey baby, I got what you need right here! <Burp>
TTW00002091	Smells like shit all the time, but at least we're safer than in the Wastes.
TTW00002092	Leave this instant!
TTW00002093	Howdy.
TTW00002094	If we lose Hoover Dam, we can kiss Nevada goodbye.
TTW00002095	True to Caesar.
TTW00002096	Ain't that the bird that tried to ice the President? Gutsy dame, showing her face in here.
TTW00002097	Well hello, pretty lady.
TTW00002098	I still can't believe we came to terms with the NCR.
TTW00002099	What the fuck are you looking at?
TTW00002100	Don't walk away, let me show you the time of your life.
TTW00002101	The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
TTW00002102	You know you want a piece of this, give me some sugar.
TTW00002103	I don't think that's what they mean by doggy style.
TTW00002104	Mmm, I haven't had a ghoul before. Do I get to keep the tip?
TTW00002105	Ooo, the big one looks like fun. Let me know if you want a good time.
TTW00002106	Gomorrah has the loosest slots on the Strip.
TTW00002107	Hot damn do I love this place.
TTW00002108	I have to go now.
TTW00002109	Finally, I have the keys. Your job is done and you've been paid, so move along. I have a trip to plan.
TTW00002110	Well, they may not all be dead, but I have the keys. I should have hired a better mercenary. Run along. I have a trip to plan.
TTW00002111	Hope you find what you're looking for.
TTW00002112	Ah, you never any fun.
TTW00002113	Good luck out there.
TTW00002114	Hail.
TTW00002115	Come back if you need something. Not like I'm going anywhere.
TTW00002116	Y'all come back real soon.
TTW00002117	I'll tell Mr. Eulogy that we talked.
TTW00002118	You'd better go before he sees you.
TTW00002119	Yeah. Come back when you've got more injuries. And some more caps.
TTW00002120	Paradise Falls is here if you need it.
TTW00002121	<belches>
TTW00002122	Yeah, just behave yourself. The boys up there don't fuck around.
TTW00002123	Go, then.
TTW00002124	Please... if you get to Underworld, let them know that I'm okay.
TTW00002125	Hey, man. Come back any time.
TTW00002126	Told you: there's nothing exciting down here.
TTW00002127	It's only a matter of time now.
TTW00002128	Come back when you are ready to drink, little man.
TTW00002129	Come back when you are ready to drink, little girl.
TTW00002130	Remember that the Department of Tourist Rights only guarantees your safety for 24 hours. After that time, you will be executed.
TTW00002131	Goodbye, Mister President.
TTW00002132	Don't let me keep you.
TTW00002133	Get out of here!
TTW00002134	Have a wonderful and productive day.
TTW00002135	Bye.
TTW00002136	See you later.
TTW00002137	Whatever.
TTW00002138	Goodbye.
TTW00002139	Bye.
TTW00002140	I need to get going.
TTW00002141	Yeah. See you.
TTW00002142	Later.
TTW00002143	Time for me to go.
TTW00002144	Later.
TTW00002145	Time for me to go.
TTW00002146	Of course, of course! Don't let me keep you!
TTW00002147	See you around, mister.
TTW00002148	I'll talk to you later.
TTW00002149	Okay, miss. See you around.
TTW00002150	I'll talk to you later.
TTW00002151	Okay, bye.
TTW00002152	I need to get going.
TTW00002153	Yeah, me too.
TTW00002154	Time for me to go.
TTW00002155	Bye-bye.
TTW00002156	See you later, alligator.
TTW00002157	Yessir, Mr. Moriarty. More drunk customers, coming up!
TTW00002158	Come back later. I mean, don't come back later. See if I care.
TTW00002159	Later, spooky girl.
TTW00002160	Watch out for Muties and Raiders.
TTW00002161	If you see anyone from Lamplight, tell them to be careful.
TTW00002162	I'm going to go look around town.
TTW00002163	We're doomed and so are you if you stick around.
TTW00002164	I'm going to go look around town.
TTW00002165	Don't get yourself hurt. I have enough red on my clothes already.
TTW00002166	Goodbye, Red.
TTW00002167	Stay clear of mutants. Especially the big, hungry ones.
TTW00002168	Later, Shorty.
TTW00002169	All right, I'll just be here doing grown-up stuff.
TTW00002170	See you, Sticky.
TTW00002171	Be careful out there. You don't want to end up on that table in Red's clinic.
TTW00002172	I'll be going.
TTW00002173	Don't be distracted by the size. Stay calm; shoot straight.
TTW00002174	All right. I'm going to get going.
TTW00002175	Keep your head low.
TTW00002176	Right. I'm out of here.
TTW00002177	Good luck out there.
TTW00002178	As you please.
TTW00002179	Don't get yourself killed.
TTW00002180	Go with great care.
TTW00002181	Brand.
TTW00002182	Let's get to it.
TTW00002183	Begone from my sight!
TTW00002184	Hurry up!
TTW00002185	We're counting on you.
TTW00002186	Get outta here.
TTW00002187	Fine, go.
TTW00002188	I'm out of here.
TTW00002189	Don't screw up, okay?
TTW00002190	The Citadel is our only chance now. We have to make it there.
TTW00002191	You have lots of work to do!
TTW00002192	Mabel's waiting for you.
TTW00002193	I look forward to seeing how you deal with this.
TTW00002194	Tell Timmy I said hi!
TTW00002195	Run along now.
TTW00002196	We'll be here.
TTW00002197	Okay, amigo.
TTW00002198	Okay, amiga.
TTW00002199	All right, man. Later.
TTW00002200	All right, girl. Later.
TTW00002201	Stay safe, brother.
TTW00002202	Stay safe, girl.
TTW00002203	Yup. Talk to you later.
TTW00002204	Yeah, me too.
TTW00002205	Sir.
TTW00002206	Ma'am.
TTW00002207	...
TTW00002208	Whatever.
TTW00002209	Happy trails partner.
TTW00002210	You know what you need to do.
TTW00002211	Thanks. Hopefully, it'll just be skinned knees and bloody noses, today.
TTW00002212	I'll let you get back to work.
TTW00002213	Don't get too hurt out there.
TTW00002214	Okay, come on!
TTW00002215	Let's keep moving.
TTW00002216	You're doing a great job. Really.
TTW00002217	All right, I'll make sure they don't cut us off.
TTW00002218	First aliens, now Death Rays. This is like a crazy TV show.
TTW00002219	You know where to find me.
TTW00002220	Well, go on! Get!
TTW00002221	Back to business.
TTW00002222	Yeah, enough gabbing. Let's move!
TTW00002223	Good travels to ya!
TTW00002224	Yes, away with you!
TTW00002225	Come back again soon! Marie and I will be waiting!
TTW00002226	Sounds like Ashur's working you pretty hard. Must be so tough for you.
TTW00002227	Yessir.
TTW00002228	As you were.
TTW00002229	Very well.
TTW00002230	Goodbye. Take care of yourself.
TTW00002231	Goodbye, Rosie.
TTW00002232	Stay away from Dave. He's mine.
TTW00002233	See you, Jessica.
TTW00002234	You're safe as long as Dave says so.
TTW00002235	See you, Jessica.
TTW00002236	Come back and visit the museum anytime!
TTW00002237	I'll leave you to the kids.
TTW00002238	Just don't bother me. I've got stuff to do for Dave.
TTW00002239	Later, Bob.
TTW00002240	I have to go practice my Dave impression, anyway.
TTW00002241	Talk to you later, kid.
TTW00002242	Goodbye, Mister Not-Dave.
TTW00002243	Talk to you later, kid.
TTW00002244	That's what Dave always says.
TTW00002245	Talk to you later, kid.
TTW00002246	I think I'd rather just stay broken than submit to any further indignity.
TTW00002247	Good luck. Careful around that bomb.
TTW00002248	Do it! Detonate the bomb and together we'll usher in a new age of prosperity!
TTW00002249	Come back if you need something.
TTW00002250	I'll expect to see you in class, Freddie. No excuses. Run along now, son.
TTW00002251	Whatever you say, Mr. Brotch.
TTW00002252	You be careful now.
TTW00002253	Let me know if you have any of that Scrap Metal to sell!
TTW00002254	Let me know if you need something.
TTW00002255	Okay. See ya later, pal!
TTW00002256	Sorry, I'll be going now.
TTW00002257	That's right. And don't come back!
TTW00002258	Sorry, I'll be going now.
TTW00002259	See you later.
TTW00002260	Bye, Timmy.
TTW00002261	Okay, yeah. Thanks for asking. I'll catch up with you later.
TTW00002262	Farewell, Outsider.
TTW00002263	May the Great One bless you.
TTW00002264	May you remain under the canopy of His protection.
TTW00002265	Come back soon!
TTW00002266	See you next time!
TTW00002267	Be back soon! And bring more caps!
TTW00002268	I'll be on my way.
TTW00002269	I suppose there's no chance for a nice conversation today, is there.
TTW00002270	Sure.
TTW00002271	I guess I'll be going.
TTW00002272	I'm fine, okay?
TTW00002273	Great! I'll see you later, Machete!
TTW00002274	No problem, Machete. See you later.
TTW00002275	Careful out there.
TTW00002276	If you insist, Derek. If you wanna talk later, I'm around.
TTW00002277	You're the boss, man. We can talk about it later, if you want.
TTW00002278	I'll be watching you.
TTW00002279	I'm leaving.
TTW00002280	Sounds like a good plan.
TTW00002281	You know you can rely on me for that.
TTW00002282	<grunts>
TTW00002283	I guess I'll be going.
TTW00002284	Good. See you later. And you better show up!
TTW00002285	You'd better believe it.
TTW00002286	I mean it.
TTW00002287	Okay, son. Okay.
TTW00002288	You got it, buddy.
TTW00002289	All right.
TTW00002290	Oh, anytime.
TTW00002291	Remember, donations are always welcome.
TTW00002292	Remember, bring me back anything interesting you find.
TTW00002293	Get that fission battery then double time it back here!
TTW00002294	We must keep moving.
TTW00002295	I really don't want to die down here.
TTW00002296	Be careful.
TTW00002297	Thank you, Janice.
TTW00002298	Bye.
TTW00002299	Good luck, honey.
TTW00002300	Be careful, my son.
TTW00002301	I have to go, Dad.
TTW00002302	Forget it! You too dumb to talk to.
TTW00002303	Stay sharp.
TTW00002304	Get a move on.
TTW00002305	I'll be leaving, now.
TTW00002306	Then get moving.
TTW00002307	I'll just be on my way, then.
TTW00002308	Y'all come back now, y'hea'?
TTW00002309	Stay righteous.
TTW00002310	Yes, you do.
TTW00002311	I have to go. Now.
TTW00002312	Come on, cheer up. Paul wouldn't want you moping around like that.
TTW00002313	I have no doubt that we shall. No doubt at all.
TTW00002314	We certainly shall. In time, everything will be solved.
TTW00002315	Harrumph.
TTW00002316	He's not listening to me. But there's someone else who might be able to convince him. We'll see.
TTW00002317	Sure you will, Butch. Sure you will.
TTW00002318	I'll keep myself safe if you do the same, Amata.
TTW00002319	Don't be silly, Susie.
TTW00002320	All right, dear. Just don't get into any trouble.
TTW00002321	We're not naming ourselves after you. Drop it, all right?
TTW00002322	I never said I didn't like it. I just haven't made up my mind yet, okay?
TTW00002323	Go ahead and punk out if you want. Me and Wally will find somebody else to be in our gang.
TTW00002324	I said I'd think about it. Come on, we need some new ones.
TTW00002325	Take care, sugar.
TTW00002326	So long, Cherry.
TTW00002327	Bye, bye, honey.
TTW00002328	See ya later.
TTW00002329	Bye bye!
TTW00002330	Talk to you later!
TTW00002331	If you see Junior, tell him that I said hi!
TTW00002332	I really look forward to preparing you for dinner sometime!
TTW00002333	Stay sharp!
TTW00002334	Keep an eye out.
TTW00002335	Bye-bye!
TTW00002336	Bye-bye, Bumble.
TTW00002337	About time.
TTW00002338	See ya around!
TTW00002339	See ya about!
TTW00002340	Okay, see you next time, bye bye!
TTW00002341	I'm going away. You stay here. Away from me.
TTW00002342	Bye!
TTW00002343	Bye, Penny.
TTW00002344	Okay.
TTW00002345	Stay cool, Sammy.
TTW00002346	Bye, then!
TTW00002347	Yeah, that's nice, scram.
TTW00002348	See you around, MacCready.
TTW00002349	Not for a while, I hope.
TTW00002350	See you around, MacCready.
TTW00002351	Back to it.
TTW00002352	If you'll excuse me, I need to go show these fish how to shoot straight.
TTW00002353	Steel walk with you.
TTW00002354	Goodbye.
TTW00002355	Good travels to you, comrade.
TTW00002356	Bye, dear.
TTW00002357	I'm afraid I can't stop and chit chat.
TTW00002358	Take care!
TTW00002359	Don't do anything I wouldn't do!
TTW00002360	Take no prisoners!
TTW00002361	Parting is such sweet sorrow
TTW00002362	Careful in D.C. now. Those Super-Mutants can be a prickly bunch. Heh heh heh heh heh.
TTW00002363	Now, get the fuck out of me face.
TTW00002364	Don't hit me!
TTW00002365	Goodbye, Gob.
TTW00002366	Sorry!
TTW00002367	Remember us if you need something!
TTW00002368	Any time.
TTW00002369	See y'all later.
TTW00002370	Bye, mister!
TTW00002371	Bye, lady!
TTW00002372	God bless The Enclave.
TTW00002373	Take care of yourself, hon.
TTW00002374	Gotcha.
TTW00002375	Well, back to work.
TTW00002376	Goodbye.
TTW00002377	Goodbye.
TTW00002378	Suit yourself. Gambling's thirsty work - I'll be here if you change your mind.
TTW00002379	No, thanks.
TTW00002380	Catch you later.
TTW00002381	Thanks for stopping in.
TTW00002382	Come back any time.
TTW00002383	Thanks for stopping in.
TTW00002384	Come on back if you get lonely, sweet thing.
TTW00002385	Yeah, whatever.
TTW00002386	Come on back if you want a game.
TTW00002387	Enjoy your stay at the Atomic Wrangler.
TTW00002388	Bye.
TTW00002389	Goodbye.
TTW00002390	See you.
TTW00002391	Idle Chatter
TTW00002392	<bored grunt>
TTW00002393	Don't get me wrong, I love to cause trouble, but you go too far.
TTW00002394	You've changed. I mean, bad is one thing. Evil is another.
TTW00002395	Did you really have to kill all of those people back there? They didn't seem so bad.
TTW00002396	I always knew that you were a teacher's pet.
TTW00002397	This do-gooder crap is for the birds.
TTW00002398	Man, you're just a little goody two-shoes, aren't you?
TTW00002399	Man, it stinks. The vault never smelled like this.
TTW00002400	Be cautious.
TTW00002401	I'm bored.
TTW00002402	Goddamn cigarettes are getting' harder to find.
TTW00002403	I could use a smoke.
TTW00002404	Man, it stinks in here.
TTW00002405	I'm concerned about this area.
TTW00002406	Sir, I am on the lookout.
TTW00002407	Be vigilant.
TTW00002408	I knew we should've never let him in. Said so at the time.
TTW00002409	Book girl has hard decision to make.
TTW00002410	Huh?
TTW00002411	What's the word? Heard anything interesting?
TTW00002412	Nothing like the smell of apple pie, is there? I can't get enough of it.
TTW00002413	Attack
TTW00002414	I'm gonna ring your bell, creep!
TTW00002415	I'm gonna ring your bell, creep!

TTW00002510	Damn it!
TTW00002511	There's more where that came from.

TTW00002538	This is lunacy!
TTW00002539	You think I'm going to let YOU stop me? After all I've been through?
TTW00002540	I'll kill you before I let anyone harm my child!
TTW00002541	First that crazy simulation, now this. Has the entire world taken leave of its senses?
TTW00002542	Traveling the Wasteland, shooting guns! By God, I'm getting too old for this sort of thing!
TTW00002543	Damnit, just leave us alone!
TTW00002544	Just like shooting that old BB Gun! You remember?
TTW00002545	Ahhhhh!
TTW00002546	Enough! Enough of this!
TTW00002547	Run!
TTW00002548	I'll have your scalp!
TTW00002549	If you won't give us the water, we'll just have to take it!
TTW00002550	Help me out, buddy! c'mon!
TTW00002551	Thought you could get away, huh?
TTW00002552	Back in your work-hole, worker.
TTW00002553	Rrrarrr!
TTW00002554	Don't let them keep us down!
TTW00002555	You got to shoot them in the head!
TTW00002556	Someone flank that one!
TTW00002557	Lay down and die!
TTW00002558	I'm gonna beat you up!
TTW00002559	You need to learn some manners!
TTW00002560	I'm going to teach you a lesson you won't forget!

TTW00002566	Your time has come!
TTW00002567	How do you like that, huh?
TTW00002568	I'm getting hungry just looking at you!
TTW00002569	Kill the Slaver!
TTW00002570	That's it, I'm officially coming out of retirement!
TTW00002571	You're messin' with the best, asshole!
TTW00002572	Somebody help me!
TTW00002573	Help me with this asshole!
TTW00002574	Eyes open and heads down, people!
TTW00002575	Take 'em down, people!
TTW00002576	You ain't so super now, huh?
TTW00002577	Too easy.
TTW00002578	You're dead!
TTW00002579	Dropping hostile!
TTW00002580	The Overseer's going to hear about this.
TTW00002581	The Overseer won't tolerate this kind of behavior.

TTW00002614	I wish there was some other way we could have worked this out.
TTW00002615	I'm afraid I'm a very lethal killing machine.

TTW00002970	I wish you hadn't done that.
TTW00002971	I'm sorry. I've been programmed to protect private property at all costs.

TTW00002974	Please put your hands in the air and prepare for disciplinary action.
TTW00002975	That is stealing. Stealing is prohibited.
TTW00002976	The class of people I'm forced to associate with these days just keeps falling.
TTW00002977	Did you really need that?
TTW00002978	Why do I get all the hoodlums?
TTW00002979	I thought I had seen every species of moronic petty bullshit, but you've just topped the list. Congratulations.
TTW00002980	Do you have no respect for private property, you slimy little commie bastard?
TTW00002981	Did you not realize that I have eyes in the back of my head?
TTW00002982	Thief!
TTW00002983	You stole that!
TTW00002984	Stop! Thief!
TTW00002985	You can't just take that!
TTW00002986	That doesn't belong to you!
TTW00002987	That isn't yours!
TTW00002988	You better put that back!
TTW00002989	Hey, that's not yours!
TTW00002990	I saw you take that!
TTW00002991	You're going to be in trouble if you don't put that back!
TTW00002992	That's stealing!
TTW00002993	Thief!
TTW00002994	Return that now.
TTW00002995	Stop!
TTW00002996	That's mine!
TTW00002997	Caught you red handed!
TTW00002998	I saw that!
TTW00002999	You should give that back.
TTW00003000	That don't belong to you.
TTW00003001	That ain't yours!
TTW00003002	Now hand that back, you low-down thief!
TTW00003003	Why you low-down nibbler, I'll have that back!
TTW00003004	I'll thank you not to touch my plunder.
TTW00003005	Don't think I didn't see that!
TTW00003006	Thief!
TTW00003007	Put that back!
TTW00003008	Hands off!
TTW00003009	That doesn't belong to you.
TTW00003010	Hey! Give it back!
TTW00003011	That ain't fuckin' yours!
TTW00003012	Give it back, asshole!
TTW00003013	Fuckin' thief!
TTW00003014	I'll take that back now.
TTW00003015	I don't think so.
TTW00003016	I don't know who you think you're fooling.
TTW00003017	Hey! I need that for stuff!
TTW00003018	Come on. At least steal from a mean person.
TTW00003019	<Sigh> Boss, if you just ask, I'll hand it to you. Probably.
TTW00003020	Boss, why do my pants suddenly feel lighter?
TTW00003021	Look, boss, I appreciate you not making me carry that, but come on.
TTW00003022	Think I didn't see that?
TTW00003023	Good way to lose a hand.
TTW00003024	Sweetie, if you want something, just ask grandma politely.
TTW00003025	Stealing isn't very nice, is it Leo?
TTW00003026	Is someone looking for a paddling?
TTW00003027	We have enough problems around here!
TTW00003028	Hey! That don't belong to you, so keep your grubby mitts off it!
TTW00003029	Stupid human!
TTW00003030	That's mine, human!
TTW00003031	That belongs to the Kings!
TTW00003032	Hey, that's ours!
TTW00003033	You gonna pay for that?
TTW00003034	That's against regulations!
TTW00003035	Put that down!
TTW00003036	Caught you in the act.
TTW00003037	Thief!
TTW00003038	Honorless thief!
TTW00003039	You debase yourself!
TTW00003040	You have no honor!
TTW00003041	I reckon that don't belong to you.
TTW00003042	Hey! That don't belong to you, so keep your grubby mitts off it!
TTW00003043	Not yours!
TTW00003044	Put that back!
TTW00003045	Thief!
TTW00003046	Hey, that's not yours!
TTW00003047	Thought no one was looking, did you?
TTW00003048	Larceny is a serious offense.
TTW00003049	That does not belong to you.
TTW00003050	Theft is not a victimless crime.
TTW00003051	If you want it, take it!
TTW00003052	If you see something you like, it's yours!
TTW00003053	Thief!
TTW00003054	You can't just take that!
TTW00003055	That doesn't belong to you!
TTW00003056	That doesn't belong to you!
TTW00003057	You can't just take that!
TTW00003058	Thief!
TTW00003059	You have no honor!
TTW00003060	You debase yourself!
TTW00003061	Honorless thief!
TTW00003062	Stay the fuck away from that.
TTW00003063	Don't touch that.
TTW00003064	That isn't yours.
TTW00003065	Fucking rat, don't touch that shit.
TTW00003066	Watch those light fingers buddy.
TTW00003067	Keep your hands off.
TTW00003068	Open fire!
TTW00003069	Stop the Outsider!
TTW00003070	I knew you'd try something.
TTW00003071	If you find a place to pawn that, go right ahead.
TTW00003072	Greed took the others - go on, keep it. I'll get it back eventually.
TTW00003073	[Christine narrows her eyes, then shakes her head and waves you off.]
TTW00003074	Take from me again, and I'll leave you for the Sierra Madre.
TTW00003075	Is thievery not considered wrong where you come from?
TTW00003076	Is your need for possessions truly so great?
TTW00003077	We're a tolerant community, but don't overstep the limits of our generosity.
TTW00003078	This isn't a New Vegas back alley. Watch what you grab.
TTW00003079	Ponedo lawatba!
TTW00003080	Katu! Pongwa de nuevu!
TTW00003081	Wa desafortuba yegwi a lawatba.
TTW00003082	No! Shtay len tahbah mah ee.
TTW00003083	Bey haz oh neekt!
TTW00003084	That doesn't belong to you!
TTW00003085	You can't just take that!
TTW00003086	Thief!
TTW00003087	Scavenger.
TTW00003088	Stealing? What are you thinking?
TTW00003089	Your mother would be ashamed of you.
TTW00003090	That ain't yours, mungo.
TTW00003091	Hey! That's mine.
TTW00003092	Hey, that's valuable junk!
TTW00003093	Now, now.
TTW00003094	There is nothing that comes free in this life, friend.
TTW00003095	Put that back, now.
TTW00003096	That doesn't bewong to you!
TTW00003097	Please! You're spoiling my experiments!
TTW00003098	Don't take that! You'll ruin everything!
TTW00003099	You there. Keep your hands off other people's property!
TTW00003100	Are you daft? That doesn't belong to you.
TTW00003101	Bad move, mungo.
TTW00003102	I thought you were different.
TTW00003103	Put that back, you big smelly mungo!
TTW00003104	Here's how we deal with robbers in Little Lamplight.
TTW00003105	You got a lot of nerve, coming in here and trying to rob us.
TTW00003106	You'd better run, you damn thief.
TTW00003107	Hey! What do you think you're doin'?
TTW00003108	Put that back!
TTW00003109	Hey! That ain't yours!
TTW00003110	That doesn't belong to you!
TTW00003111	Put that back at once!
TTW00003112	Thief!
TTW00003113	I'd recommend putting that down.
TTW00003114	Alarm! We're being robbed!
TTW00003115	That's not your property!
TTW00003116	You stole that!
TTW00003117	I saw you take that.
TTW00003118	Thieving bastard.
TTW00003119	How dare you!
TTW00003120	That's not yours, now is it?
TTW00003121	Thief!
TTW00003122	Put that back, thief!
TTW00003123	Thief! Stop!
TTW00003124	You stole that!
TTW00003125	Hey. What's the big idea? I don't mess with your stuff. Don't mess with mine.
TTW00003126	Yield
TTW00003127	Please, have mercy!
TTW00003128	Better not try that again.
TTW00003129	Better not try that again.
TTW00003130	A wise decision.
TTW00003131	Fine. I'll kill you next time.
TTW00003132	I accept. Do it again, and you're a corpse.
TTW00003133	Just calm down, okay?
TTW00003134	I'm so relieved we can put that unpleasantness behind us.
TTW00003135	Cheerio. Water under the bridge.
TTW00003136	Do that again and I'll put my foot so far up your ass you'll cough up boot polish!
TTW00003137	Better not try that again.
TTW00003138	I'll forgive you. This time.
TTW00003139	Good. Perhaps there's some semblance of civility left in you, after all.
TTW00003140	Paz patasooba.
TTW00003141	Don't push your luck again.
TTW00003142	Huh. I guess it's all right, then.
TTW00003143	Consider yourself lucky.
TTW00003144	All right, but don't let it happen again!
TTW00003145	Smart move.
TTW00003146	Smart move.
TTW00003147	Better not try that again.
TTW00003148	Better not try that again.
TTW00003149	You best not do that again.
TTW00003150	All right, but don't let it happen again!
TTW00003151	You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
TTW00003152	Pickpocket
TTW00003153	Crime detected. Death sentence authorized by judicial circuits.
TTW00003154	It's a shame that you had to do that.
TTW00003155	Unauthorized materials requisition detected.
TTW00003156	The class of people I'm forced to associate with these days just keeps falling.
TTW00003157	Please tell me that you did not just do what I think you did!
TTW00003158	Thief!
TTW00003159	A pickpocket!
TTW00003160	Stop! Thief!
TTW00003161	You can't do that!
TTW00003162	You stole that!
TTW00003163	Are you crazy?
TTW00003164	Stealing from a King is a capital offense in Freeside.
TTW00003165	I thought I smelled a rat.
TTW00003166	That's mine!
TTW00003167	Get your own!
TTW00003168	Try robbing me, will you?
TTW00003169	What are you doing?
TTW00003170	Gonna smash stupid thief!
TTW00003171	You want something? I'll give you something!
TTW00003172	Keep your hands to yourself!
TTW00003173	Hey, that's mine!
TTW00003174	What in God's name has gotten into you?
TTW00003175	Hey! What are you doing?
TTW00003176	Is this how I raised you? To steal from me?
TTW00003177	That's stealing!
TTW00003178	You're in trouble now!
TTW00003179	Help, he's robbing me!
TTW00003180	Help, she's robbing me!
TTW00003181	Keep that up, you're gonna end up wearin' a collar.
TTW00003182	Really now. What are you thinking?
TTW00003183	Are you stupid, you big shit-butt?
TTW00003184	You will cease at once.
TTW00003185	What do you think you're doing? Stop that!
TTW00003186	Stop that at once!
TTW00003187	Hey! Only my bitches are allowed in my pants!
TTW00003188	Give that back!
TTW00003189	You find anything you like in those pockets? Huh?
TTW00003190	Get your fuckin' hands out of my pockets.
TTW00003191	Please keep your hands to yourself.
TTW00003192	Damnit. Keep your hands to yourself!
TTW00003193	If you wish to keep all your fingers, you'll keep them to yourself.
TTW00003194	Hey now! Cut that out!
TTW00003195	Kindly remove your grubby hands from my pockets.
TTW00003196	Guards!
TTW00003197	Get your fucking hands out of my stuff.
TTW00003198	Just like every other thieving mungo.
TTW00003199	There's a reason why we don't let mungos in here.
TTW00003200	Thought I wouldn't notice your fat fingers going through my pockets?
TTW00003201	You think you can just come in here and take my stuff?
TTW00003202	You dirty sneak! Give me that back!
TTW00003203	You must think I'm pretty stupid.
TTW00003204	Are you out of your fucking mind?
TTW00003205	You have a death wish or something?
TTW00003206	Are you for real?
TTW00003207	Wow. You're so screwed.
TTW00003208	What? You touchin' my stuff?
TTW00003209	Oh no you didn't.
TTW00003210	Get your hand outta' there!
TTW00003211	Wha? You out of your mind?
TTW00003212	Thief!

TTW00003215	Alarm! We have a thief!
TTW00003216	Hey! Those are mine!
TTW00003217	How dare you!
TTW00003218	Keep your hands to yourself.
TTW00003219	You got a problem?
TTW00003220	Looking for something?
TTW00003221	Find anything you like?
TTW00003222	Get your hands out of my pockets.
TTW00003223	What do you think you're doing?
TTW00003224	Thief!

TTW00003228	Get your hand outta' there!
TTW00003229	Are you for real?
TTW00003230	Hey! Keep your hands to yourself!
TTW00003231	Uhhh? What are you doing?
TTW00003232	Bad idea. Very bad idea.
TTW00003233	Try that again, you draw back a stump.

TTW00003248	Gonna make a fuss, then?
TTW00003249	Eh, you tryin' to drygulch me?

TTW00003267	Assault! Assault!
TTW00003268	You dirty coward!
TTW00003269	What the hell?!
TTW00003270	Adding target to threat matrix.
TTW00003271	Reanalysis complete. Threat level red.
TTW00003272	I'm sorry that you had to act that way.
TTW00003273	I'm afraid that kind of behavior can't be tolerated.
TTW00003274	Antisocial behavior detected.
TTW00003275	Criminal behavior will be punished.
TTW00003276	Antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
TTW00003277	Not very sporting of you.
TTW00003278	That's hardly Marquess of Queensberry rules, now is it?
TTW00003279	You'll pay for that, you cheeky bastard!
TTW00003280	What is your major malfunction, maggot?
TTW00003281	You make me sick, you worthless scumbag.

TTW00003293	Stop! Stop it!
TTW00003294	You looking for trouble?
TTW00003295	You dare assault a Brother of Steel?
TTW00003296	Help! She's attacking me!
TTW00003297	What's your problem, punk?
TTW00003298	Tangle with the Gun Runners and it's the last thing you'll do.
TTW00003299	What the hell are you doing?
TTW00003300	You want to rock? Let's rock.
TTW00003301	What's your problem, punk?

TTW00003325	What?! Okay, you're ass is mine.
TTW00003326	Hmm. Some people have no respect for the sanctity of life.
TTW00003327	Natural selection at it's finest.
TTW00003328	What the hell? No one gets away with murder in my town!
TTW00003329	Murderer!
TTW00003330	You'll pay for that!
TTW00003331	My word. Was that truly necessary?
TTW00003332	I think I'm going to be a trifle sick.

TTW00003351	Are you sick in the head or something?
TTW00003352	What demon would possess you to do such a thing?
TTW00003353	You son of a bitch.

TTW00003395	Hey! That's not okay.
TTW00003396	What are you doing?
TTW00003397	Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss, what the hell?
TTW00003398	Boss, you really think that's a good idea?
TTW00003399	Oh, good, the boss is murdering people now. Excellent.
TTW00003400	Going to run out of friends at the rate you're going.
TTW00003401	You are such an asshole sometimes.
TTW00003402	Whose side are you on?
TTW00003403	Did you do that on purpose?
TTW00003404	You shouldn't be so naughty, pumpkin!
TTW00003405	No, no, no! Leo does the chopping, not you, dearie!
TTW00003406	That wasn't a nice thing to do!

TTW00004136	All clear.
TTW00004137	Area secure.
TTW00004138	False alarm. Standing down.

TTW00004159	Guess it was just in my head.
TTW00004160	Aw, forget this.
TTW00004161	Your death is my revenge!
TTW00004162	Ah, forget it. I'm gonna go get a drink.
TTW00004163	Done and done.
TTW00004164	Glad that's over.
TTW00004165	What trickery is this? Only Nightkin should vanish like that!
TTW00004166	Ah, forget it. I'm gonna go get a drink.

TTW00004189	I'm supposed to be retired.
TTW00004190	No more fightin' for me.
TTW00004191	That's enough.
TTW00004192	Looks like they hightailed it.
TTW00004193	Looks like I run them off.
TTW00004194	Guess they threw up the sponge.
TTW00004195	That wraps that up.
TTW00004196	Coward.
TTW00004197	Guess I'm done here.
TTW00004198	You should've known better.
TTW00004199	Well, that's that.

TTW00004205	Probably afraid of me.
TTW00004206	Had enough? I thought so.
TTW00004207	Yeah, I'd run away, too.
TTW00004208	Fucked you up, bitch! And you know it!
TTW00004209	Glad that's over with.

TTW00004218	What? Is it over?
TTW00004219	Oh my God. I can't believe that just happened.
TTW00004220	<whimpering>
TTW00004221	Haha! Gary!
TTW00004222	Yum yum! Eat em' up!
TTW00004223	That'll teach you to mess with me.
TTW00004224	Ha ha! You zombies can kiss my ass!
TTW00004225	There's more of them somewhere, I just know it.
TTW00004226	Whoa, that was intense.
TTW00004227	Sucker didn't know who he was messing with! Hah!
TTW00004228	Okay, who's next?!

TTW00004234	Forget about it.
TTW00004235	We'll save a shell for you.
TTW00004236	Don't think you can just up and run away.
TTW00004237	Where'd you go?
TTW00004238	Where'd they go, Rhonda?
TTW00004239	Let me go take a look around.
TTW00004240	Damn it. Where'd he go?
TTW00004241	I bet I know where you went.

TTW00004249	You're behaving very rudely. I wouldn't hide from you, if our positions were reversed.
TTW00004250	Do not attempt to flee. You will be identified and sanctioned.
TTW00004251	Fugitive is attempting to evade capture. Beginning pursuit.
TTW00004252	Initiating search for hostile target.
TTW00004253	Just what I was hoping for. Trundling around looking for something that wants to blow me to flinders.
TTW00004254	Must we play hide and seek now?
TTW00004255	Ready or not, here I come!
TTW00004256	That's a good start. Now just keep running and we'll call it even.
TTW00004257	Somebody find me something to shoot at!
TTW00004258	Who's got a target?
TTW00004259	Restore contact with the enemy, goddammit!
TTW00004260	Holy shit! A Stealth Boy!
TTW00004261	A Stealth Boy! Damn it!
TTW00004262	Damn it. Where'd he go?
TTW00004263	Let me go take a look around.
TTW00004264	I bet I know where you went.
TTW00004265	Anybody see anything?
TTW00004266	Split up and search the area.
TTW00004267	Huhn?! Gary!
TTW00004268	Coulda sworn you was here!
TTW00004269	Gave me the slip.
TTW00004270	Come on now and fight honorable like?
TTW00004271	Quit your hidin' and fight!
TTW00004272	Pony up, now! Lord hates a coward.
TTW00004273	Where'd you go?
TTW00004274	Hmph. Tricky little bastard, ain't ya?
TTW00004275	I know you're still out there.
TTW00004276	Come out, finish this!
TTW00004277	I know you're still out there.
TTW00004278	Where the hell did you go?
TTW00004279	Where are ya?
TTW00004280	Where'd you go?
TTW00004281	You won't get away!
TTW00004282	Damn, lost 'em!
TTW00004283	I'm not done with you!
TTW00004284	Where the fuck are you?
TTW00004285	Quit playin' games!
TTW00004286	Come out here and fight!
TTW00004287	Do you think you can hide from me?
TTW00004288	Show yourself, Outsider.
TTW00004289	Yee nad loo shee!
TTW00004290	Guhst fair schvoond!
TTW00004291	Fair flick!
TTW00004292	Where'd you go?
TTW00004293	Where'd you go?
TTW00004294	Where'd you go?
TTW00004295	So you want to play hide and seek, eh?
TTW00004296	Where'd you go?
TTW00004297	Hey! Where'd you go?
TTW00004298	What? Gone? How'd that happen?
TTW00004299	It's got to be here somewhere.
TTW00004300	I think it's gone somewhere else!
TTW00004301	Where'd it go?
TTW00004302	It's behind me, isn't it?
TTW00004303	Stay alert, Brothers.
TTW00004304	What fun! A game of hide and seek!
TTW00004305	Lost sight of target.
TTW00004306	Is it safe now?
TTW00004307	This can't be happening. This just can't be happening.
TTW00004308	I do so enjoy a good hunt!
TTW00004309	I'll find you, and then you'll be sorry!
TTW00004310	I'm growing tired of this little game of ours. Show yourself!
TTW00004311	What? Did I scare you that easy? Ha ha ha!
TTW00004312	Ah doan'se hem!
TTW00004313	Cobar'e! Deha coriendoo!
TTW00004314	Where'd they go?
TTW00004315	Where the fuck did you go?
TTW00004316	We'll find ya' one way or another.
TTW00004317	Let's bounce, boys.
TTW00004318	Guess he's gone.
TTW00004319	Guess she's gone.
TTW00004320	The True Eyes show me the intruder is gone.
TTW00004321	I can't find anything.
TTW00004322	Hmm. Oh well.
TTW00004323	Must have got away.
TTW00004324	That zombie will be back. I just know it.
TTW00004325	I think it's gone somewhere else!
TTW00004326	Where'd it go?
TTW00004327	It's behind me, isn't it?
TTW00004328	Nobody here anymore.
TTW00004329	Guess she's gone.
TTW00004330	Guess he's gone.
TTW00004331	Huh. Looks like they left.
TTW00004332	Hmph. Better get back to my bitches! Ha, ha!
TTW00004333	Cleared out, I guess.
TTW00004334	Yo eechay.
TTW00004335	Sha shin neekt.
TTW00004336	Shih ahm fair tig es zookuh.
TTW00004337	I got you next time.
TTW00004338	Hard to believe I scared somebody off.
TTW00004339	Up and left on me.
TTW00004340	Seems they made like a ghost.
TTW00004341	It would appear they skedaddled.
TTW00004342	I guess I run them off.
TTW00004343	Damn, guess they're gone.
TTW00004344	Long gone by now.
TTW00004345	Fine, stay hidden for all I care.
TTW00004346	Dammit. Got away.
TTW00004347	Maybe next time.
TTW00004348	Ah, to hell with this.
TTW00004349	I ain't chasin' 'em.
TTW00004350	This is too much runnin' for an old man.
TTW00004351	Someone younger can run after 'em.
TTW00004352	Not really worth looking for anyway.
TTW00004353	Okay, I give up.
TTW00004354	Fine. I'll get your ass next time.
TTW00004355	Next time, then.
TTW00004356	Shit. Guess I lost 'em.
TTW00004357	Gary? Gary?
TTW00004358	Must have bugged out.
TTW00004359	Hmm. Oh well.
TTW00004360	I can't find anything.
TTW00004361	Cleared out, I guess.
TTW00004362	Stand down.
TTW00004363	I guess we ran 'em off.
TTW00004364	Threat analysis: green. Perimeter secure. Resuming standard operations.
TTW00004365	Threat analysis: green. Perimeter secure.
TTW00004366	Threat analysis: green. No hostiles detected.
TTW00004367	Oh well. I wish you hadn't left so soon. I was having such a good time with you.
TTW00004368	I'll miss you. Please come back and see me again.
TTW00004369	I hope I didn't hurt your feelings with all that shooting and flaming. I'm afraid it's just the way I was programmed.
TTW00004370	Hostile has escaped. Transmitting description to designated law enforcement authorities.
TTW00004371	Fugitive has evaded pursuit. Law enforcement authorities now have primary responsibility for apprehension.
TTW00004372	Search complete. No hostiles detected. Standing down.
TTW00004373	Typical chickenshit commie maneuver.
TTW00004374	The enemy has retired before the awesome might of the U.S. army.
TTW00004375	This battlefield now belongs to Uncle Sam!
TTW00004376	Guess she's gone.
TTW00004377	Guess he's gone.
TTW00004378	Huh. Looks like they left.
TTW00004379	Damn. Got away.
TTW00004380	Buggered off, eh? Fine. I was done playing with you anyway.
TTW00004381	That's right! Don't mess with me!
TTW00004382	Is it safe now?
TTW00004383	This can't be happening. This just can't be happening.
TTW00004384	Slippery humans.
TTW00004385	Comes back, we'll deal with it then.
TTW00004386	Ahm matenka look.
TTW00004387	Wa atendu? Uds pasane.
TTW00004388	Got away.
TTW00004389	I guess they're gone. Probably for the best.
TTW00004390	I give up.
TTW00004391	Fuck this, I got shit to do.
TTW00004392	There you are!
TTW00004393	Target lock status: green. Reengaging hostile target.
TTW00004394	Hostile target detected. Target lock status: green.
TTW00004395	Target lock acquired. Resuming lethal force neutralization operation.
TTW00004396	Were you trying to hide from me?
TTW00004397	You'll find that my electronic sensors are quite sophisticated.
TTW00004398	My search routines are quite advanced, don't you think?
TTW00004399	Fugitive has been located. Commencing attack.
TTW00004400	Your attempted escape is only making things worse for you.
TTW00004401	Do not make any further escape attempts, lawbreaker.
TTW00004402	You cannot hide from me, you commie maggot!
TTW00004403	You can run, but you can't hide!
TTW00004404	Your worthless hide is mine!
TTW00004405	Thought hiding would save you?
TTW00004406	Aha!
TTW00004407	You can't hide from me.
TTW00004408	Over here!
TTW00004409	You're done hidin'!
TTW00004410	Shoulda gone quietly.
TTW00004411	Knew it!
TTW00004412	Draw, pardner!
TTW00004413	Prepare to run against the pill!
TTW00004414	Yeehaw!
TTW00004415	Got ya!
TTW00004416	Knew you'd turn up sooner or later.
TTW00004417	Ah, there you are!
TTW00004418	There you are.
TTW00004419	Let's finish what we started.
TTW00004420	Nice try.
TTW00004421	There ya are!
TTW00004422	Couldn't hide, could ya?
TTW00004423	Got my eye on you now!
TTW00004424	You're mine!
TTW00004425	Now it ends!
TTW00004426	Got 'em!
TTW00004427	Found you!
TTW00004428	There you are!
TTW00004429	Here we go!
TTW00004430	You thought you could lay low?
TTW00004431	No, ni kahn neekt ruhn!
TTW00004432	Dahs eet!
TTW00004433	Ni ar toht!
TTW00004434	There you are!
TTW00004435	There you are!
TTW00004436	There you are!
TTW00004437	There you are!
TTW00004438	You can't hide from me.
TTW00004439	Aha!
TTW00004440	Thought hiding would save you?
TTW00004441	You can't escape my True Eyes!
TTW00004442	There you are!
TTW00004443	There you are!
TTW00004444	Oh my God!
TTW00004445	HEEELLLPPP!
TTW00004446	Oh no!
TTW00004447	Somebody, anybody, help me!
TTW00004448	<screaming in fear>
TTW00004449	It's coming this way!
TTW00004450	We're all going to die!
TTW00004451	Got him!
TTW00004452	There you is!
TTW00004453	Zombie, over there. I see you!
TTW00004454	Spotted, over there!
TTW00004455	There you are!
TTW00004456	Positive contact near the Archives!
TTW00004457	Positive ID on lost target acquired!
TTW00004458	Reengaging target!
TTW00004459	Target found! Firing!
TTW00004460	We've got the target!
TTW00004461	Target relocated! Engaging!
TTW00004462	Here he is!
TTW00004463	Here she is!
TTW00004464	So are you going to let me kill you now, or are you going to run away again?
TTW00004465	I knew it! Oh I'm gonna tear you apart!
TTW00004466	Ha ha! I found you!
TTW00004467	Deyai-yoo, maikku!
TTW00004468	Estee val a duela a katu!
TTW00004469	There you are.
TTW00004470	That's sweet of you trying to keep my hopes up, to convince me he's still alive. But I can tell you're not telling me the truth.
TTW00004471	Bill's dead, isn't he? Actually, I don't want to hear anymore. Thank you for your help. I need to let the others know what happened to Bill.
TTW00004472	Here, take these stimpaks. It's all I have.
TTW00004473	How dare you talk like that! Bill's dead, isn't he?
TTW00004474	Actually, I don't want to hear anymore. Thank you for your help. I need to let the others know what happened to Bill.
TTW00004475	Sorry friend. You oughta keep better track of your loved ones.
TTW00004476	I'd deal with you myself, except these people are going to need someone to watch out for them out there.
TTW00004477	The Overseer's insane and thought no one would leave if they all died. <Lie>
TTW00004478	But we don't want to give up the safety of the Vault. We just want to end its isolation.
TTW00004479	That's what you and my father don't seem to understand!
TTW00004480	I've been across this Wasteland, and nowhere's safer than this Vault. Trust me.
TTW00004481	But we can't stay isolated forever, or eventually all we'll have left is a handful of inbred remnants!
TTW00004482	This Vault is the safest place I've ever seen. It's insane to give that up.
TTW00004483	You may think Vault security is just bunch of chubby guys in padded helmets, but I promise you, most of them aren't as friendly as you remember.
TTW00004484	Just report in that I'm here for one last visit. I'm sure security won't mind.
TTW00004485	Don't worry about it; I won't tell the Overseer if you won't. To tell the truth, I'm glad she did.
TTW00004486	Heck, maybe you can even put all this trouble to rest once and for all.
TTW00004487	It wasn't a message from her. I just had a hunch she was in trouble. <Lie>
TTW00004488	Even they aren't foolish enough to destroy their homes just to prove a point. It could only have been you!
TTW00004489	How many of them do you think will survive out there? Still, better a few of them stay alive out there than have them all die down here.
TTW00004490	The evacuation will begin immediately. But you won't be joining them outside. I'll see to that myself!
TTW00004491	One of the rebels did it to force everyone to leave. <Lie>
TTW00004492	The previous Overseers were idiots, and we nearly died because of their naivete. I'm simply trying to make up for their mistakes.
TTW00004493	In a generation or two, no one will remember it ever happened, and we'll still be the safest, purest humans left.
TTW00004494	But for that to happen, we can't let ourselves be further tarnished by outsiders.
TTW00004495	I know that the vault's been open before, and that you lied about its isolation.
TTW00004496	We can make more. That's what humanity does. It survives.
TTW00004497	You simply don't have enough people to stay isolated down here forever.
TTW00004498	My only secret is patience. If I could share it with you, I would.
TTW00004499	Can you share your secret to getting them to grow?
TTW00004500	I've got some I keep for myself in case there's an accident or something. Will you shut up about this if I give some to you?
TTW00004501	This kind of crap gets around, you know. You try bullying too many people, and it's going to cost you.
TTW00004502	Give me the fungus, or I'll seal this place underground. And you with it.
TTW00004503	They're more like a tradition. Most of them were passed down from this book we found down back, called "Vault Boy's Big Book of Laughs for Kids".
TTW00004504	They're not really funny, but something about hearing them is a little comforting, you know?
TTW00004505	That was pretty funny! <Lie>
TTW00004506	No. Because I don't trust you.
TTW00004507	She's a jerk, but she's still one of us.
TTW00004508	Can you tell me why Princess gets angry about her nickname?
TTW00004509	I don't want to talk about it with you.
TTW00004510	You said you used to have another guard. What happened?
TTW00004511	No! I'm not supposed to go outside with strangers!
TTW00004512	I'm afraid whoever told you that you were charming was playing a cruel joke on you. But don't fret. There are other means to persuade.
TTW00004513	That's not going to work on me.
TTW00004514	I'm not falling for that.
TTW00004515	No, I'm sorry. I will not force her to awaken. I can't predict the effect it may have on her system.
TTW00004516	If you're headed back there anyway, how about I ride along for just 250 caps?
TTW00004517	I'm not stupid, and I'm not falling for your tricks. Forget it!
TTW00004518	Ha ha. Really now? I'm afraid you aren't as agile tongued as you'd like to think.
TTW00004519	But I digress. If it's payment you need, all I can offer is one of my Mutagenic Bioenhancers.
TTW00004520	If I had a cap for every punk that tried that line on me, I'd be rich.
TTW00004521	Your voice stress patterns indicate you are telling a falsehood. This is in violation of Protocol NC-01.
TTW00004522	I'm sorry. You have now exceeded 2 demerits. Now instituting Expulsion Protocol KL-001.
TTW00004523	Your voice stress patterns indicate you are telling a falsehood. This is in violation of Protocol NC-01.
TTW00004524	One demerit will now be issued. Note that further demerits can cause your expulsion from this job posting.
TTW00004525	As previously stated, please identify yourself.
TTW00004526	Not an option, I'm afraid. We aren't exactly rolling in cash, down here.
TTW00004527	Yeah, sorry. I don't think so.
TTW00004528	Sorry, smoothskin. I can't take the risk. Moriarty will beat the shit out of me for even talking to you!
TTW00004529	I'm not buying it. I mean, I know it's scary, but you can't half-ass something like this, you know?
TTW00004530	Now, go on out there walk through that Minefield like a real researcher!
TTW00004531	I'm not buying it. I mean, I know it's scary, but you can't half-ass something like this, you know?
TTW00004532	Now, go on out there walk through that Minefield like a real researcher!
TTW00004533	Last time I checked, I was the man in charge around here. Now get out of my face. I have things to do.
TTW00004534	Where'd you go, punk?
TTW00004535	Don't make me come looking for you.
TTW00004536	Who's there?
TTW00004537	I know I heard something. Don't worry, Rhonda. We'll find them.
TTW00004538	Where'd you go, punk?
TTW00004539	Threat analysis: yellow. Scanning for hostiles.
TTW00004540	Alert. Non-combatants are advised to leave the area. Security sweep in progress. Lethal force may be used without warning.
TTW00004541	No hostiles detected. Continuing perimeter sweep.
TTW00004542	Don't be alarmed if I try to kill you when I find you. It's just the way I've been programmed.
TTW00004543	Why don't you just come out where I can see you?
TTW00004544	I'll find you eventually, you know.
TTW00004545	Where are you?
TTW00004546	Scanning for hostiles.
TTW00004547	This area clear. Proceeding with search protocol.
TTW00004548	Please step into the open and identify yourself. Law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear.
TTW00004549	It's just little old me. Nothing to be afraid of.
TTW00004550	Someone dirty and disreputable, I shouldn't wonder.
TTW00004551	Here kitty-kitty-kitty!
TTW00004552	As if I'd know what to do if I found something.
TTW00004553	Why not let the robot deal with it?
TTW00004554	I'm going to look over here now.
TTW00004555	Are you afraid of me? You should be because I'm going to kick your ass when I find you!
TTW00004556	Step forward and identify yourself!
TTW00004557	Do you think you can hide from me?
TTW00004558	I'm starting to get angry. You would not like me when I'm angry.
TTW00004559	Are you playing games with me, goddammit?
TTW00004560	I cannot wait to find you so I can kill you as a personal favor to Uncle Sam.
TTW00004561	Do you think you can hide from me?
TTW00004562	Hmm. I was sure I heard something.
TTW00004563	Huh?
TTW00004564	What was that?
TTW00004565	Maybe I'm just jumpy.
TTW00004566	Anybody there?
TTW00004567	I don't like this.
TTW00004568	Somethin' don't feel right.
TTW00004569	I do believe I heard somethin'.
TTW00004570	Now what was that?
TTW00004571	Hmm?
TTW00004572	Come on out!
TTW00004573	What was that?
TTW00004574	Thought I heard something.
TTW00004575	Something over there?
TTW00004576	What was that?
TTW00004577	Hm?
TTW00004578	What?
TTW00004579	Anyone there?
TTW00004580	Hello?
TTW00004581	What was that noise?
TTW00004582	Huh?
TTW00004583	Somethin' there?
TTW00004584	What was that?
TTW00004585	Come out. I just want to talk.
TTW00004586	You're not getting away.
TTW00004587	Voh ni ar?
TTW00004588	Ni ar heer?
TTW00004589	Hello? Who's there?
TTW00004590	Who's there?
TTW00004591	Anybody there?
TTW00004592	Maybe I'm just jumpy.
TTW00004593	What was that?
TTW00004594	Who's there?
TTW00004595	What was that?
TTW00004596	I thought I heard something.
TTW00004597	At least I can finally see where I'm going.
TTW00004598	This is crazy. I'm going to get myself killed.
TTW00004599	I do so enjoy a good hunt!
TTW00004600	I'll find you, and then you'll be sorry!
TTW00004601	I'm growing tired of this little game of ours. Show yourself!
TTW00004602	I know you're out there, clown shoes!
TTW00004603	Is someone there?
TTW00004604	Somethin there?
TTW00004605	Hello? Someone there?
TTW00004606	Ahn yoo here stih?
TTW00004607	Ke ruido estee-na?
TTW00004608	Stay sharp.
TTW00004609	What's going on?
TTW00004610	Got my eyes peeled.
TTW00004611	Keep looking, everyone.
TTW00004612	What was that?
TTW00004613	Is there someone out there?
TTW00004614	What say you come out and we play some more?
TTW00004615	I'll find you.
TTW00004616	Come out now, and Tabitha will be merciful. Or at least an approximation thereof.
TTW00004617	I've got something for you...
TTW00004618	You can't hide from me forever.
TTW00004619	I'm going to find you.
TTW00004620	Where are you?
TTW00004621	Alert. Non-combatant safety cannot be guaranteed.
TTW00004622	Target lock status: red. Continuing perimeter sweep.
TTW00004623	Alert. Hostile remains at large. Recommend non-combatants seek secure location.
TTW00004624	There's no point in trying to hide from me, you know. I've been programmed to be quite relentless.
TTW00004625	Please come back. I'm sorry about all that recent unpleasantness.
TTW00004626	Where are you?
TTW00004627	Are you still there?
TTW00004628	Warning. Dangerous fugitive is on the loose. Do not attempt to apprehend.
TTW00004629	Attention. Fugitive should be considered armed and dangerous.
TTW00004630	Continuing search for fugitive.
TTW00004631	You better run, you commie-loving bastard!
TTW00004632	Who's got a target?
TTW00004633	Come on, people, I need a target!
TTW00004634	I'm going to find you.
TTW00004635	You can't hide from me forever.
TTW00004636	Nothing yet.
TTW00004637	Where did you go?
TTW00004638	I've got something for you...
TTW00004639	You're a damn coward!
TTW00004640	No use hidin'!
TTW00004641	Doggone it. Show yourself!
TTW00004642	I intend to see you dead, outlaw.
TTW00004643	Death's comin' for ya, I swear!
TTW00004644	Won't help you none to lay low.
TTW00004645	Hiding won't help, you know.
TTW00004646	Just wait till I find you.
TTW00004647	You won't escape that easily.
TTW00004648	Come out you coward!
TTW00004649	Hiding won't save you!
TTW00004650	This isn't over!
TTW00004651	Hm?
TTW00004652	You just disappear?
TTW00004653	You still there?
TTW00004654	Don't think you can hide forever.
TTW00004655	You're dead, you hear me?
TTW00004656	Come out, come out wherever you are!
TTW00004657	You think you'll get away from me?
TTW00004658	Runnin' away like a little bitch!
TTW00004659	I'm gonna pop you when I find you again.
TTW00004660	Show yourself.
TTW00004661	Ee sists ah.
TTW00004662	Dah tse ni ar gey gonen.
TTW00004663	Voh ni ar?
TTW00004664	Ahm nananga yoo.
TTW00004665	Mabe yoo gaihaiwa?
TTW00004666	Haganai yoo?
TTW00004667	You can't hide from me forever.
TTW00004668	Come out, come out, wherever you are!
TTW00004669	I'll find you.
TTW00004670	I'll find you.
TTW00004671	Hunh? Gary?
TTW00004672	It's all a big mistake! Come with me and we'll figure it out together!
TTW00004673	I do so enjoy a good hunt!
TTW00004674	I'll find you, and then you'll be sorry!
TTW00004675	I'm growing tired of this little game of ours. Show yourself!
TTW00004676	Gonna find you soon, human!
TTW00004677	Here human, human, human. I got a treat for you!
TTW00004678	Come out, come out wherever you are! Ha ha!
TTW00004679	Me val a discube katu.
TTW00004680	Not finding much.
TTW00004681	I'll blow this place apart if I have to.
TTW00004682	Come out, come out, wherever you are.
TTW00004683	You done? Good.
TTW00004684	That it?
TTW00004685	Enjoy!
TTW00004686	Come back if you're still hungry!
TTW00004687	See you soon, drunky.
TTW00004688	Come back when you're sober.
TTW00004689	That should liquor you up for a while.
TTW00004690	Come back anytime!
TTW00004691	Enjoy the drinks.
TTW00004692	Enjoy the ride.
TTW00004693	You'll be higher that a fucking kite.
TTW00004694	Good hunting!
TTW00004695	Don't hurt yourself!
TTW00004696	You'll shoot your eye out!
TTW00004697	Let me know if you need anything else.
TTW00004698	A pleasure doing business with you.
TTW00004699	Another satisfied customer.
TTW00004700	Give me a shout if you need anything else.
TTW00004701	Thanks.
TTW00004702	Thanks.
TTW00004703	Give me a shout if you need anything else.
TTW00004704	Another satisfied customer.
TTW00004705	Pleasure doing business with you.
TTW00004706	Try not to break it, outsider.
TTW00004707	Watch out!
TTW00004708	Whoa!
TTW00004709	Look out!
TTW00004710	Damn, it's a fight!
TTW00004711	Ain't none of my business!
TTW00004712	Whoa!
TTW00004713	Watch out!
TTW00004714	This should be interesting.
TTW00004715	Barbarians.
TTW00004716	So much violence in the world these days.
TTW00004717	This isn't right.
TTW00004718	This is what we've come to.
TTW00004719	Yeah! Awesome!
TTW00004720	Me no kaade partu estee.
TTW00004721	Fight!
TTW00004722	It would be nice if things could stop tearing each other apart around here.
TTW00004723	It's time for you to leave.
TTW00004724	You've got to leave now so I can lock up.
TTW00004725	I'm locking up, so you'll need to leave.
TTW00004726	Get out of here.
TTW00004727	Time for you to go.
TTW00004728	This is the Overseer.
TTW00004729	This is the Overseer.
TTW00004730	Dean
TTW00004731	Howdy. My name is Jed Masterson, and I'm a caravan boss for the Happy Trails Caravan Company.
TTW00004732	Rangers, this is the chief. I know I can ramble on sometimes, but I need you to listen close for the next minute or so. I've got some bad news.
TTW00004733	Rangers get injured all the time. It's part of the job. But if you lose a few fingers, get a bad break, that's it. You step down.
TTW00004734	We rely on each other too much to let our infirmities become a liability. A ranger knows when it's time. Only I didn't.
TTW00004735	Somewhere along the way, something broke inside me. I couldn't find us a way out of this desert. I wrestled with it, and it took me down a dark road.
TTW00004736	I wish I could explain it to you. The old chief's finally at a loss for words.
TTW00004737	Send me all the Legion you can. I'll be waiting for them.
TTW00004738	We stand now at the precipice.
TTW00004739	This is an automated distress message from Vault-Tec Vault 101. Message begins:
TTW00004740	Outside of the Pitt, the world lies in ruins and survivors scratch in the dirt without dreams. But in the Pitt, we can live and rebuild with purpose.
TTW00004741	<unintelligible>
TTW00004742	All peace-loving peoples must join together to stop the war of aggression being waged by the Wall Street gang!
TTW00004743	This is Tenpenny Tower radio, music and inspiring talk for forward thinking people.
TTW00004744	Game Over Man! GAME OVER!
TTW00004745	You can't be serious.
TTW00004746	Yeah, right. I'm not holding out hope for the cavalry to come save the world.
TTW00004747	I hope you're right. I really do. But after 200 years, don't you think they'd have done something by now?
TTW00004748	Oh, come on. I'm a nice guy, really. May I please come in?
TTW00004749	Well, okay. But you better not be lying, or else we'll shoot you.
TTW00004750	Oh, come on. I'm a nice guy, really. May I please come in?
TTW00004751	Well, okay. But you better not be lying, or else we'll shoot you.
TTW00004752	Oh, come on. I'm a nice gal, really. May I please come in?
TTW00004753	Yeah, I'm sure.
TTW00004754	Come on. Let's get the gate open for you, mungo.
TTW00004755	I want to use Murder Pass to reach Vault 87.
TTW00004756	You sure about that? It's scary in there. Even I don't like going in there, and I'm really brave.
TTW00004757	I hear there's a door that doesn't work.
TTW00004758	Nuh-uh. Door works fine. Computer's broke.
TTW00004759	Well, maybe not broke, but it sure don't work right. I turned it off because it was just wasting power.
TTW00004760	Know anything about the area outside Megaton?
TTW00004761	Outside of Megaton? Any place other than here sounds like heaven to me. Fuck this place.
TTW00004762	If it weren't for you Wasteland types coming through with your caps, I'd be out of here in a second. Assuming that I could convince Jenny and Leo.
TTW00004763	What do you know about the Wasteland?
TTW00004764	What can you tell me about Megaton?
TTW00004765	Stay the fuck out of me business, don't go where you don't belong, and buy your drinks here. That's all you need to know.
TTW00004766	Some people hate this place, but I guess that's their right, what the hell do they want out of life? Food, shelter and safety. Works for me.
TTW00004767	Is there a bar in town?
TTW00004768	Just be careful. Moriarty is NOT your friend, no matter what he may say, so don't fall for his lies. And for god's sake, don't trust the man.
TTW00004769	I need some equipment. Where's the nearest general store?
TTW00004770	Seek out Moira at Craterside Supply, although the true pilgrim relies on Atom to supply all that he needs.
TTW00004771	Seek out Moira at Craterside Supply. She's a darling girl.
TTW00004772	Moira sells all kinds of stuff at her place, Craterside Supply. Take a guess where it is? Heh heh heh heh.
TTW00004773	Where's the closest clinic?
TTW00004774	Atom can only heal the wounds of the soul. For wounds of the body, you should see Doc Church. His clinic is directly to the north the Church.
TTW00004775	You'll want to see Doc Church next to the Crater. Take your time.
TTW00004776	Our clinic is down in the crater, by the bomb. Doc Church is a little rough around the edges, but the man's got talent and compassion.
TTW00004777	You'll want to see Doc Church next to the Crater. You can't miss it.
TTW00004778	I'm looking for my father. Middle-aged guy. Maybe you've seen him?
TTW00004779	Oh, yeah! I do remember a guy like that.
TTW00004780	Honestly, I usually keep my head down. I tend to get smacked around if I look customers in the eyes. But talk to Moriarty, he'll know more.
TTW00004781	I can't talk about that anymore. Moriarty will beat me again if I do.
TTW00004782	Not in here, I haven't.
TTW00004783	Many of the transient visitors end up at one of Megaton's seedier establishments.
TTW00004784	I suggest you speak to Colin Moriarty and continue your search there.
TTW00004785	Oh man, you're looking for your dad? That is so sweet! Did he run out on you when you were a kid or something?
TTW00004786	Our parents died when we were kids. My brother Leo, he's the oldest, he raised my brother Andy and me. It was hard on him, but we turned out okay.
TTW00004787	But God, you don't want to hear about that. I'm sorry, but I haven't seen your dad. He didn't eat at the Brass Lantern. I'd remember if he did.
TTW00004788	I usually avoid most of the Wasteland types that come through here, but there was one guy.
TTW00004789	Unlike most of the wannabe heroes that come in, he looked like he could actually read a book without giving himself a headache.
TTW00004790	He spent a bunch of time at Moriarty's before moving on. I'd try talking to Colin.
TTW00004791	I'm glad we understand each other. Now, have you seen my dad?
TTW00004792	I usually avoid most of the Wasteland types that come through here, but there was one guy.
TTW00004793	Unlike most of the wannabe heroes that come in, he looked like he could actually read a book without giving himself a headache.
TTW00004794	He spent a bunch of time at Moriarty's before moving on. I'd try talking to Colin.
TTW00004795	Well, come to think of it, I do remember a stranger coming through here. Had a look in his eye. You know the kind a man gets when he's got a purpose.
TTW00004796	Spent some time up in the saloon. Might want to check with Moriarty. Just watch yourself. That man's trouble.
TTW00004797	Could be the guy I saw at Moriarty's Saloon not too long ago. I'd ask there.
TTW00004798	Pffft. Nice hat, Calamity Jane.
TTW00004799	Just as long as we understand each other. This here is my town. These are my people. You so much as breathe wrong, and I'm gonna fuckin' end ya.
TTW00004800	Is there a weapons dealer around here?
TTW00004801	Go see Moira at Craterside Supply. She sells some weapons. Makes some too, from what I hear. Her place is down by the crater.
TTW00004802	You'll probably want to see Moira at Craterside Supply. She sells some weapons. Makes some too, from what I hear. Her place is down by the crater.
TTW00004803	Well I'll be! I could have sworn I heard this corpse speak! But that's impossible. Dead men don't talk, do they? They LISTEN. They OBEY.
TTW00004804	Oh, hey Jericho, baby! What's going on?
TTW00004805	Jericho, baby! What's happening?
TTW00004806	Food, Jericho. It's all I had for you yesterday. It's all I have for you today. It's all I'll ever have for you.
TTW00004807	What is it, Leo?
TTW00004808	Oh, heya Nathan. Sorry, I got lost in my work. What do you need?
TTW00004809	I've been having those visions again. Not while I sleep, dear husband, but waking dreams. I see Atom, finally free! His glory revealed at last!
TTW00004810	You look beautiful today, Nova. Just like always.
TTW00004811	Yeah. Good idea. Not gonna happen.
TTW00004812	And where do you propose that we pick one of those up? We'd have to pay the caravan scavengers, and who knows what they'd bring back.
TTW00004813	We should stay our course, dearest husband. Atom's power penetrates us all, does it not? Soon, every soul of Megaton will revel in His glory!
TTW00004814	Do not despair, dearest husband. Soon, all of Megaton will bask in Atom's glow.
TTW00004815	Who told you that?
TTW00004816	Me? A Raider? Are you joking? I'm not a Raider! I've never even met a Raider before!
TTW00004817	I'm not a Raider! I swear! Who told you that? They're lying!
TTW00004818	Me? Working with Raiders? Hell no! I just want to get a place here in Megaton, and I'll kill any Raider who shows up here to prove it!
TTW00004819	Oh! Sorry, I guess I got ahead of myself, huh? Maggie's nine, sweetest little girl you'd ever care to meet. We take care of each other.
TTW00004820	I ain't never had a daughter, but if I did, I'd want her to be Maggie. I took her in when her parents got killed by Raiders. That was two years ago.
TTW00004821	It was a pretty bad scene. Small settlement up north. I'd stopped in to trade some salvage, and the whole place had been wiped out.
TTW00004822	I found Maggie hiding under a bed, in the same room where her parents had been butchered. We've been together ever since.
TTW00004823	I have to go now.
TTW00004824	Please, do what you can to find my brother.
TTW00004825	Hey, thanks again for doing this for me, it means a lot.
TTW00004826	Remember, my offer still stands.
TTW00004827	Tell me about the Family.
TTW00004828	Even if all of us look different on the outside, we all have had the same vice infesting our insides.
TTW00004829	But now, through my teachings, these subjugated people have come together and formed a bond stronger than mere friendship.
TTW00004830	I'm looking for Ian West. Have you seen him?
TTW00004831	I haven't seen any of the Wests since we were told to head indoors.
TTW00004832	Nope. Everyone stays inside, except Evan King of course.
TTW00004833	If I recall he and the boys are probably at the lake fishing. Those rapscallions! There's no telling what monkeyshines they'll get into next!
TTW00004834	I'm afraid Vance has him in isolation and there's no way I'm going to override Vance's orders.
TTW00004835	Like I said, he's in isolation. It's his time to meditate and reflect.
TTW00004836	Anything else you can tell me about Ian West?
TTW00004837	Vance has him in meditation right now. No one's supposed to be in there.
TTW00004838	Nope. Like I told ya, Vance has him in meditation right now. No one's supposed to be in there.
TTW00004839	Anything else you can tell me about Ian West?
TTW00004840	I don't have any authority here. I'm pretty new myself.
TTW00004841	Justin's been trying to talk to Ian; make him feel better. Maybe you should speak to him.
TTW00004842	Do I look like a fucking babysitter? I don't know where he is. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.
TTW00004843	Ian, Ian, Ian! Is that all you've got to say? Sheesh.
TTW00004844	Anything else you can tell me about Ian West?
TTW00004845	Ian? What do you want from him?
TTW00004846	No, just that Vance said he isn't to be disturbed while he's in meditation.
TTW00004847	Anything else you can tell me about Ian West?
TTW00004848	I had always assumed if a human happened upon our home, it would be for the purpose of our extermination.
TTW00004849	It appears my fears were ill-placed. It is a pleasant surprise to meet someone as amenable as yourself.
TTW00004850	Very well. I will allow you to speak to Ian. Perhaps you can help him come to grips with his greatest enemy. Himself.
TTW00004851	Now that I have a better understanding of the Family, may I speak to Ian?
TTW00004852	I believe I was very clear when I said you are not welcome to see him.
TTW00004853	Please allow me to speak to Ian.
TTW00004854	Ah yes, my newest charge. What would you want with him?
TTW00004855	I've been searching for a young man named Ian West.
TTW00004856	What's the word around town?
TTW00004857	Hey, maybe I'll put that on the sign out front: "The Brass Lantern: Cleaner, safer, and less likely to have piss in the drinks".
TTW00004858	People've been sayin' that there's somethin' wrong with the water purifier. But Ol' Walter's been keepin' that thing runnin' for decades.
TTW00004859	Not sure if you've met her, but Lucy West, that pretty young thing? She's afraid. Of what, of who, I couldn't say. But you can feel the fear on her.
TTW00004860	I already told you about the Stahl boy's drug problem. You said you wanted to help.
TTW00004861	That's about all the confidences I'm going to break for you, stranger.
TTW00004862	What do you know about the people here?
TTW00004863	A doctor doesn't talk about his patients. At least not to strangers, he doesn't.
TTW00004864	What do you know about the people here?
TTW00004865	I ain't heard much. Truth be told, I don't really ever leave the Lantern. Too much work, too few hours in the day, ya know?
TTW00004866	Remember what I told you, kid: Moriarty keeps his money locked up right next to his bed.
TTW00004867	I'm sorry, I just haven't been paying any attention at all since Nathan died.
TTW00004868	There's only one thing that concerns me in this town these days: what my damn fool husband is doing.
TTW00004869	He wanders around here all day and all night, preaching about the Enclave and tryin' to get parts for his guns.
TTW00004870	I'm not sure who's the bigger fool, him or me. After all, I married him.
TTW00004871	I'm not one to gossip, but I do know a few things. For instance, did you hear that Lucas wants someone to disarm our bomb?
TTW00004872	Imagine the blasphemy! I can't believe it! I mean, I don't believe it. He would never do that to us.
TTW00004873	I couldn't tell you, really. I'd talk to Manya if you care that much. She's lived in Megaton longer than anyone.
TTW00004874	Tell me where he is, Moriarty, or I'll beat it out of you!
TTW00004875	Listen carefully. I don't know what Sheriff Simms told you, but this is my town. Simms, he's a facade. An illusion of order I allow to exist.
TTW00004876	I was slinging drinks and killing Raiders here in Megaton when the good sheriff was just an idiot kid with cowboy fantasies.
TTW00004877	You're lying. The Vault's been sealed for 200 years!
TTW00004878	That's right. Your father, his Brotherhood of Steel friend, and you, the suckling babe with nary a tit to suckle. Sorry about your mum. Truly.
TTW00004879	Is that what your father told you? That you were born in that hole? That HE was born there as well?
TTW00004880	Oh, the lies we tell to those we love.
TTW00004881	That's right. Your father, his Brotherhood of Steel friend, and you, the suckling babe with nary a tit to suckle. Sorry about your mom. Truly.
TTW00004882	I was kidding! Dad talked about you all the time. Now really, where is he? <Lie.>
TTW00004883	What's on the menu?
TTW00004884	Sorry, hon. The noodle stand is closed. If you want something, ask Leo in the restaurant.
TTW00004885	Then you best unhear it. I know all about you, old man. I'd be careful before I went around town spreading rumors about Raiders. You dig?
TTW00004886	All right, all right! Stop your pathetic sniveling and just do what you're fucking told.
TTW00004887	Gob? If I hear one more excuse come out of that rotting mouth, I'm going to sew it shut. Okay? There's a good zombie.
TTW00004888	Hey, if we ain't going to look out for each other, what's the point? You think Colin gives a shit about us, Gob? Come on, sweetie, wake up.
TTW00004889	It's important, Leo! I have to keep our head above water here. Please, just try to be more careful.
TTW00004890	Ha ha! I just love seeing you happy, sweetheart.
TTW00004891	I hear things. I know a few people. What of it?
TTW00004892	Anything for you, Nova. Anytime.
TTW00004893	I don't have 100 caps.
TTW00004894	If you don't have the caps to pay for the information, then maybe you could do a little favor for me.
TTW00004895	I want to buy a drink.
TTW00004896	Tell it to Gob, he'll get you whatever you need.
TTW00004897	No problem at all. I'll take care of you until that lazy zombie wakes up to do his job.
TTW00004898	Can't you tell the difference between me and a feral? Fine. I'll show you the goddamn difference! Just you wait! You'll get yours. All of you!
TTW00004899	I can help take care of that little Ghoul problem for you.
TTW00004900	Is that so? And why should I believe that? You ever kill a Ghoul before?
TTW00004901	Son of a bitch!
TTW00004902	What do you know about Vault 87?
TTW00004903	That's behind the Back Door! The Back Door is my job, and I do it really well!
TTW00004904	See what happens is, Mayor says he wants the door open. Then I help him because I'm good at it. It takes two of us to do it.
TTW00004905	But only Mayor can say it's okay. You gotta talk to him, and then I'll help him.
TTW00004906	Not much, really. Mayor has us steer clear of the door to Murder Pass, just in case. If you go near it, you can hear them howling.
TTW00004907	Can't hear much around the other door, though. I guess maybe there aren't as many back there. Doesn't matter much, though.
TTW00004908	Yeah, I know that place. Yep, sure do. Monsters back there. Big, scary monsters. Lots of them. Tons, even.
TTW00004909	Are you going there? Are you? Are you gonna shoot 'em dead? I bet you are. That'll be so cool. Unless they eat your face. They do that, you know.
TTW00004910	That's where the monsters come from. We don't go back there. It's called Murder Pass for a reason, you know?
TTW00004911	If you go that way, you're probably gonna get hurt. I can patch you up as long as it's not real bad.
TTW00004912	I don't know what that is, mister.
TTW00004913	Do you suspect your family is in danger?
TTW00004914	Goodbye.
TTW00004915	Don't let me keep you.
TTW00004916	It's time for me to go.
TTW00004917	Your plan is finished, get out of here!
TTW00004918	Are you out of your goddamned mind? Do you have any idea how long we've pained to put this plan into motion?
TTW00004919	Weeks of preparation, destroyed. No words of mine can express my utter contempt for you.
TTW00004920	You have made a very poor error in judgment, my friend. One day... one day it WILL come back to haunt you.
TTW00004921	Messing with that bomb seems pretty technical. What if I can't do it?
TTW00004922	Lack the aptitude, you mean? You're not re-wiring the thing, just attaching the Pulse Charge to the detonator.
TTW00004923	If you get stumped, talk to Leo Stahl. He might have something to help you concentrate. He's got a bit of a reputation.
TTW00004924	I thought you knew what you were doing. If it's just nerves, maybe some chems will help. But if you can't handle it, don't go fiddling with it!
TTW00004925	I'm not sure I can disarm the bomb.
TTW00004926	We're talking a lot of innocent lives here, Burke. Can I warn them?
TTW00004927	Absolutely not! The place, the people, they're one and the same! Sacrifices for a nobler future.
TTW00004928	I assure you, they are worth ten times as much in death, as they are in life.
TTW00004929	All right, Mister Burke. I'll do it. Megaton will burn.
TTW00004930	Excellent! I had a feeling about you. Here's the Fusion Pulse Charge. It needs to be installed inside the bomb.
TTW00004931	When it's done, meet me at Tenpenny Tower. It's southwest of here, well out of harm's way. You can't miss it. Questions?
TTW00004932	Oh. I see. I didn't realize Megaton had any guardian beyond its intrepid sheriff. Very well, then. I'll take my leave, as you suggested.
TTW00004933	Throw in an extra 500 caps, and you've got yourself a deal.
TTW00004934	Well played! An extra 500 caps, in addition to the base fee, when Megaton lies in ruins. Here's the Fusion Pulse Charge. Place it in the bomb.
TTW00004935	When it's done, meet me at Tenpenny Tower. It's southwest of here, well out of harm's way. You can't miss it. Any questions?
TTW00004936	You're a sick man, Burke. This conversation's over.
TTW00004937	It seems I have misjudged you. Very well. I'll simply find someone with more entrepreneurial spirit. Good day.
TTW00004938	No, no, I'm merely a recruiter. YOU get to have the real fun.
TTW00004939	The undetonated atomic bomb for which this town is named is still very much alive. All it needs is a little motivation.
TTW00004940	I have in my possession a Fusion Pulse Charge. Once rigged to the bomb, it will be detonated, by you, at a secure location. Easy money, my friend.
TTW00004941	Go on. I'm listening.
TTW00004942	The undetonated atomic bomb for which this town is named is still very much alive. All it needs is a little motivation.
TTW00004943	You'll rig it to the bomb. Then you'll get paid. Handsomely. What do you say?
TTW00004944	Tell me about Allistair Tenpenny.
TTW00004945	He's the landlord, although you hardly ever see him. I had to treat him once for bed sores, if you know what I mean.
TTW00004946	What can you tell me about Tenpenny Tower?
TTW00004947	Some might say that Tenpenny Tower is my crowning achievement. But no! No, my dear girl, it is just the beginning!
TTW00004948	Quite a tower you have here, Mr. Tenpenny.
TTW00004949	I'd like to do business with you.
TTW00004950	I only carry the finest garments.
TTW00004951	My Boutique has many unique items for the discerning customer.
TTW00004952	What are you in the mood for?
TTW00004953	Can I get something to eat?
TTW00004954	Enjoy the holiday discount, compliments of Mister Tenpenny!
TTW00004955	I'm thirsty.
TTW00004956	And what will our most distinguished guest be having today?
TTW00004957	I'm thirsty.
TTW00004958	I have an excellent selection of thirst quenchers.
TTW00004959	I'm thirsty.
TTW00004960	I have some first aid supplies I can sell.
TTW00004961	I guess we could do a little trading. Here's what I got.
TTW00004962	You got an armament supply? Want to do some trading?
TTW00004963	Here's what I got.
TTW00004964	You got an armament supply? Want to do some trading?
TTW00004965	This letter is all Ian has left of his old life. Allow me to give it to him.
TTW00004966	Your words impress me, human. Perhaps I misjudged you when we first met.
TTW00004967	If you wish to speak to Ian, you are free to do so. Here is the code to the area in which he is meditating.
TTW00004968	I find this all very hard to believe.
TTW00004969	The hunger that drives us must be kept in check. It is one of the most difficult things to teach.
TTW00004970	Ian lost control because no one was around to guide him. His own family was alien to him.
TTW00004971	He had a moment of weakness, and it was fatal.
TTW00004972	Initiate triage protocol.
TTW00004973	I'm sorry, Ian, but your parents are dead.
TTW00004974	You think I don't know that? You think I don't know what I did?!
TTW00004975	RadioGoodbye
TTW00004976	Message repeats.
TTW00004977	So you know how to find one?
TTW00004978	Possibly. I'm afraid I won't be able to assist you directly; the news Doctor Li has brought will require me to be elsewhere.
TTW00004979	I can, however, give you access to an old Pre-War computer from Vault-Tec. It may have the information you need.
TTW00004980	You'll find the terminal in the archives in the A ring.
TTW00004981	The code is "Priority Override, Authorization code 420-03-20-9"
TTW00004982	...
TTW00004983	Root level access granted. Override O-923. Authorization J-512. Self-destruct sequence initialized.
TTW00004984	Civilian is requested to secure FEV vial and vacate the facility at once.
TTW00004985	Now what will you do?
TTW00004986	It'll be hard goin', but we'll do the best we can.
TTW00004987	I just hope that one day, these kids'll grow up to go some good for this place, after all the evil that's been done here.
TTW00004988	Do you like living in Andale?
TTW00004989	It's okay, I guess. There aren't a lot of kids around here and no one who comes to visit stays around long.
TTW00004990	Dad says it could be worse; that there are a lot of starving kids in other places. But still, I wish I had more kids to play with.
TTW00004991	Command protocol delta-five-three. Disengage security program.
TTW00004992	Command accepted. Security program disengaged.
TTW00004993	Yes, fellow employee? What can I do for you on this wonderful day?
TTW00004994	Very well. Give me a few moments to bring the system online.
TTW00004995	What do you mean, "If we can make it"?
TTW00004996	We're underground. No one's been down here for a long time. Odds are we're not alone. Understand me?
TTW00004997	We don't have time to waste. We need to get moving.
TTW00004998	Wait here. I'll scout ahead.
TTW00004999	Are you sure? I don't want to stay in one place for too long.
TTW00005000	Let's get moving. Follow me.
TTW00005001	We'll be right behind you. Be careful.
TTW00005002	I believe I can handle things from here.
TTW00005003	This ain't over, daddy's girl.
TTW00005004	Fine. Let's go. I was done here, anyway.
TTW00005005	Done? We're not done! I say when we're done.
TTW00005006	Don't know who put you in charge. I say we're done. Let's go, Paul.
TTW00005007	We're done here.
TTW00005008	I've heard you do anything he tells you. And I mean anything.
TTW00005009	What? What kind of shit is that? No one talks that way about Wally Mack!
TTW00005010	He's not the boss of me! Nobody's the boss of me! I'm out of here.
TTW00005011	Leave her alone, or you'll answer to me.
TTW00005012	Whoa, take it easy. No need to go all psycho on me again. We were just joking with her.
TTW00005013	Get away from me!
TTW00005014	You think you're special because your daddy is the Overseer?
TTW00005015	She's nothing, Butch!
TTW00005016	Show it to her, Butch!
TTW00005017	Helping people? What about helping your own son?
TTW00005018	I can understand that you're angry. You have a right to be.
TTW00005019	Perhaps the choice I made wasn't the right one. At the time, I thought I was doing what was best for you.
TTW00005020	Helping people? What about helping your own daughter?
TTW00005021	You really think you can do this? Make this thing work?
TTW00005022	I wouldn't be here if I didn't. With what I've learned from Doctor Braun, I know it can work.
TTW00005023	That's why it's so important to find a G.E.C.K. as soon as possible. It's the key to Project Purity.
TTW00005024	Do I look like someone that you want to blow off?
TTW00005025	Okay, tough guy. Say what's on your mind.
TTW00005026	Well now, looks like she's got some spice. Say what's on your mind.
TTW00005027	Sure, let's team up.
TTW00005028	Smart move.
TTW00005029	Okay, the Declaration is secured in the Archives Strongroom underground.
TTW00005030	There's a concealed cargo lift right here in the center of the rotunda. I've spent a few days hacking the lock with my remote terminal.
TTW00005031	When you're ready, punch in the password and let's get going.
TTW00005032	What's it like living at Tenpenny Tower?
TTW00005033	Our new neighbors aren't so bad after all. And they have big appetites, so that's good for the cafe!
TTW00005034	It's swell. Those new neighbors of ours like to drink almost as much as I do… and boy, do they have some real good stories!
TTW00005035	Things are going well, I'd say. We've all learned a thing or two about what makes a real community. Don't you think, comrade?
TTW00005036	I guess I don't mind those Ghouls as much as I thought I would.
TTW00005037	Those Ghouls are disgusting, so I just spend all my time up here.
TTW00005038	I'm surprised by my fellow tenants. I used to think they were all closed minded idiots. Turns out they aren't so bad after all.
TTW00005039	I've been looking for you.
TTW00005040	I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I'm sure Evan King is pretty pissed right about now.
TTW00005041	I bet he has the entire town out looking for me. He's worse than my parents.
TTW00005042	So what are you doing in the Metro tunnels?
TTW00005043	Biding our time, making plans, getting ready. Tenpenny and his pack of elitist wannabes can't keep us out of that tower forever.
TTW00005044	We got rights. And we'll take them if they aren't given to us.
TTW00005045	Biding our time, making plans, getting ready. Tenpenny and his pack of elitist wannabes can't keep us out of that tower forever.
TTW00005046	We've got rights. And we'll take them if they aren't given to us.
TTW00005047	What about it?
TTW00005048	Let's talk about Tenpenny.
TTW00005049	What about it?
TTW00005050	Let's talk about Tenpenny.
TTW00005051	Roy is coming up with a plan to get us into that tower. Tenpenny's. Says it's only a matter of time.
TTW00005052	He's strong like that. He never gives up. The kind of guy who makes things happen, Roy is. That's why the others follow him.
TTW00005053	Me, I just like the way he looks at me. Makes me feel pretty again. I'd go anywhere with him.
TTW00005054	I've been stomping around with Roy and his gang of misfits. Roy's a no nonsense, take no prisoners kinda guy.
TTW00005055	He heard about this Tenpenny asshole, and now he's trying to get us in that tower. He's hatching some kind of plan to kill all those bigot bastards.
TTW00005056	Believe it or not, I used to vacation there.
TTW00005057	You eat people's brains, right? So what's it like being a zombie?
TTW00005058	You got balls. Really big ones. I'll assume you're kidding 'cause no one shit talks me and lives.
TTW00005059	We Ghouls are just like the rest of you: Shit out of luck and doing our best to make it.
TTW00005060	You're the prejudiced asshole, not me. So you're ugly. Big deal.
TTW00005061	Maybe I misjudged. Pardons. So yeah, people treat us like shit. But it just makes us stronger.
TTW00005062	Otherwise we ain't no different than anyone else that had the misfortune to live past infancy.
TTW00005063	No, really. I mean it. I don't care if you're a Ghoul or not.
TTW00005064	Uh-huh? Fine, whatever. Being a Ghoul ain't anything worse than any other thing somebody's got to deal with.
TTW00005065	Like your stupidity, for example. You can't help it. You were born stupid, or dropped on your head as a kid.
TTW00005066	Either way it ain't nothing you can change. So you deal with it.
TTW00005067	I didn't mean to offend. I'm not prejudiced.
TTW00005068	Sure, whatever you say. You pretentious two-faced asshole.
TTW00005069	Listen good. I'll say this only once. I can respect a man's privacy. But I don't put up with bullshit.
TTW00005070	Keep to yourself and we'll be fine. Cause any trouble for me or mine, and I'll end you. We understand each other?
TTW00005071	Mind your fucking business, that's who.
TTW00005072	Have you met Roy? He's killed lots of people before. I'm his gal. He protects me. So better not try anything.
TTW00005073	I'm trouble. That's all you need to know.
TTW00005074	Harmless? Well, you're lucky I don't stick you and take your shit. Watch yourself, we don't take kindly to strangers, 'specially sweet-talking ones.
TTW00005075	You got nothing to worry about. I'm harmless.
TTW00005076	You're a bitch to find.
TTW00005077	Well, maybe that's because I don't want to be found.
TTW00005078	Why the heck are you looking for me anyway?
TTW00005079	Oh that sounds bad. I need my head. Where's Paradise Falls?
TTW00005080	I'm afraid your head will explode if you don't get to Paradise Falls. Sorry.
TTW00005081	You're a slave now. Nothing personal. Get to Paradise Falls if you want to live.
TTW00005082	My stuff? Okay.
TTW00005083	Give me all your stuff!
TTW00005084	Okay, okay. Here.
TTW00005085	You're a slave now! Better get to Paradise Falls before your head explodes!
TTW00005086	The Slavers? I'm a slave? How did this happen?!
TTW00005087	Give my regards to the Slavers in Paradise Falls. Move, or your head goes boom!
TTW00005088	You're staring into space. You feeling okay? Wake up!
TTW00005089	Have you been drinking? You'd better go get some rest.
TTW00005090	I'm going to put this collar on you. Just hold real still for a minute.
TTW00005091	I have some friends who want to meet you. Here, put this collar on.
TTW00005092	You look exhausted. Let me carry your stuff for a while.
TTW00005093	I think you've got something that belongs to me. I need it back.
TTW00005094	There's a thief about, and you seem distracted. I'll hold onto your gear.
TTW00005095	<Donate 100 caps.>
TTW00005096	Bless you, child.
TTW00005097	<Donate 50 caps.>
TTW00005098	Bless you, child.
TTW00005099	<Donate 10 caps.>
TTW00005100	Bless you, child.
TTW00005101	Who's in charge around here?
TTW00005102	Well, Moriarty thinks he is, but Lucas Simms is the law around here and everyone knows it.
TTW00005103	I need a drink.
TTW00005104	I need to buy medical supplies.
TTW00005105	Plannin' on goin' out and getting' shot up, eh?
TTW00005106	Yeah? What do you need?
TTW00005107	Not quite as good as that vault stuff you're used to, but it'll do you.
TTW00005108	I'm hurt. I need help, Doc.
TTW00005109	Look at you! You're fine! Don't come in here wasting my time with your hypochondria. I've got actual patients to see to.
TTW00005110	Oh, you do not. Just suck it up, you big baby.
TTW00005111	Well, you're standing fine, but you could use some switching up. That'll be 50 caps.
TTW00005112	Your vitals are fine, but you could use some stitches on those cuts. Tell you what, 50 caps sound good?
TTW00005113	You know, all things considered, you could be worse off. I can stitch you up for 50 caps.
TTW00005114	I'm surprised you made it in here. I can fix you up, but it'll run you 100 caps. What do you say?
TTW00005115	Oh, you do not. Just suck it up, you big baby.
TTW00005116	Well, you're standing fine, but you could use some switching up. That'll be 50 caps.
TTW00005117	I'm surprised you made it in here. I can fix you up, but it'll run you 100 caps. What do you say?
TTW00005118	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
TTW00005119	That takes a lot of nerve, threatening to bury us all alive and then crawling to me for help. As RJ would say, "Fuck off, mungo."
TTW00005120	Can I get some medical treatment?
TTW00005121	Sure thing. Run into a bit of trouble out there?
TTW00005122	You're lucky you're one of us. I'd be charging you through the nose, otherwise.
TTW00005123	Can I get some medical treatment?
TTW00005124	Got scraped up a bit out there, huh?
TTW00005125	Can I get some medical treatment?
TTW00005126	Yeah, but only because you saved three of ours.
TTW00005127	Looks like it's just a scrape. I can take care of it for 50 caps.
TTW00005128	Can I get some medical treatment?
TTW00005129	Okay, but it'll cost you. Every spare cap I get from you is more medicine for these germ-magnets.
TTW00005130	Looks like it's just a scrape. I can take care of it for 50 caps.
TTW00005131	Can I get some medical treatment?
TTW00005132	Yeah, but only because you saved three of ours.
TTW00005133	That looks pretty bad. For 75 caps, I can take care of that.
TTW00005134	Can I get some medical treatment?
TTW00005135	Okay, but it'll cost you. Every spare cap I get from you is more medicine for these germ-magnets.
TTW00005136	That looks pretty bad. For 75 caps, I can take care of that.
TTW00005137	Can I get some medical treatment?
TTW00005138	Yeah, but only because you saved three of ours.
TTW00005139	This is going to be tricky. And not at all pleasant. And it'll cost you 100 caps.
TTW00005140	Can I get some medical treatment?
TTW00005141	Okay, but it'll cost you. Every spare cap I get from you is more medicine for these germ-magnets.
TTW00005142	This is going to be tricky. And not at all pleasant. And it'll cost you 100 caps.
TTW00005143	Can I get some medical treatment?
TTW00005144	Maybe you should have been more careful down here, mungo. You're on your own.
TTW00005145	Can I get some medical treatment?
TTW00005146	Unless you've got hurt feelings, there's not a damn thing wrong with you. Come back when you've got some injuries that I can earn some money from.
TTW00005147	Hey, if you needed help, I'd gladly take your money, but you're just fine, buck-o. Now stop wasting my time.
TTW00005148	Let's see, a few Stimpaks and a couple of stitches should get you goin'. And it'll only run you 50 caps.
TTW00005149	All right, a few stitches and a couple of bandages should fix you up. Let's call it 50 caps. Sound good?
TTW00005150	You know, when I saw you limping in here, I knew that I smelled money. That'll be 100 caps. Or you can just bleed to death. Your choice.
TTW00005151	Well, hello, meal ticket. 100 caps. Or I can just wait for you to die and take it.
TTW00005152	Don't think because I'm a Ghoul, I'm stupid. You're fine.
TTW00005153	Is this a trick question? I don't even see a scratch on you.
TTW00005154	I'd hesitate to even call this a wound, but if you insist. 50 caps should cover my expenses.
TTW00005155	Yeah, you could do with some work. It'll set you back 75 caps, but well worth it.
TTW00005156	This is pretty bad, but I've seen worse. Still, it's going to cost 75 caps to get you back on your feet.
TTW00005157	Yeah, you look almost as bad as I do. Of course, I'm supposed to look this way and you aren't. 100 caps will do it for my expenses.
TTW00005158	Did you get the number of that Brahmin that trampled you? Sheesh! If you want me to stitch you back together, it'll be 100 caps.
TTW00005159	I don't see anything wrong with you.
TTW00005160	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
TTW00005161	I don't see anything wrong with you.
TTW00005162	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
TTW00005163	For you? No problem. Now, hold still.
TTW00005164	Heal me up, Red.
TTW00005165	Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though. Let's say 75 caps.
TTW00005166	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
TTW00005167	Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though. Let's say 75 caps.
TTW00005168	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
TTW00005169	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
TTW00005170	You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for 150 caps.
TTW00005171	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
TTW00005172	I don't see nothing wrong with you.
TTW00005173	That's not the worst injury I've seen - hell, it's not even the worst this week. I think we can patch you up.
TTW00005174	This doesn't look too bad. We'll have you good as new in no time.
TTW00005175	That's not so bad. I'll have you looking good as new. I mean, what are the chances of me botching another routine procedure in the same day?
TTW00005176	Don't look like nothing too serious. Let me patch you up.
TTW00005177	Unless you dipped that in cheese fondue, I'd say it's infected. Let me fix that up for you.
TTW00005178	Sure. I can help you out.
TTW00005179	Yeah, that's looking pretty bad. I think we can do something about it though - just a minute.
TTW00005180	Damn, that's got to hurt. Okay, hold still, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
TTW00005181	Jesus, I don't think that's supposed to just dangle like that. And what the hell is that thing there?
TTW00005182	It's gonna be expensive. Try not to speak. Just nod yes or no.
TTW00005183	Holy God, what battlefield did you just crawl off of? I'm going to be honest, this is kind of out of my league, but I'll do what I can.
TTW00005184	I wasn't going to say anything, but when you walked in here I thought you were a ghoul. We better get to work on this quick.
TTW00005185	This? This is nothing. You should see some of the wounds I've seen paladins come back with.
TTW00005186	That's not so bad. I should be able to treat you rather quickly.
TTW00005187	By Steel, I haven't seen wounds like this since HELIOS. I've got to get you treated quickly.
TTW00005188	I'm sorry, but is this supposed to be a joke? There's nothing wrong with you. I can tell just by looking.
TTW00005189	Are you kidding? Me? Shut the hell up, Ghoul. I'll beat you if I feel like it.
TTW00005190	Gah! Fuck! What are you?
TTW00005191	I guess they don't have a lot of Ghouls in the Vault.
TTW00005192	What do you do around here?
TTW00005193	Me? I deal with the caravan suppliers. I used to ride with those guys, so they cut me some good deals. Helps keep the town supplied.
TTW00005194	Me? I don't do a damn thing. Well, unless you count staying piss drunk and making Moriarty rich as something.
TTW00005195	Sure, I'm the best shot in town with a rifle, so everyone comes running to ol' Jericho when the Raiders show up.
TTW00005196	But between raids, they're content to take my money and drag me home when I've had too much. Hahaha!
TTW00005197	You're goddamn right "never mind".
TTW00005198	Here, take this Magnum.
TTW00005199	How about a Chinese Pistol?
TTW00005200	Hmm, okay. Never used one of these before, but I can probably figure it out.
TTW00005201	I can give you a Silenced 10mm Pistol.
TTW00005202	I'm not sure the silencer will do me much good, but I'll take it. Thanks.
TTW00005203	I've got a 10mm Pistol. Want it?
TTW00005204	Sure. Beats having nothing, doesn't it?
TTW00005205	I've got a .32 caliber pistol.
TTW00005206	I guess it's better than nothing. Thanks.
TTW00005207	Sorry, I don't have a pistol on me.
TTW00005208	Okay. If you find one, let me know.
TTW00005209	Hey Leo, can you hook me up?
TTW00005210	What'll it be?
TTW00005211	Yeah, sure thing.
TTW00005212	What am I gonna say? No? You've got me over a barrel.
TTW00005213	Look. Keep your bullshit judgments to yourself, man. Just don't tell Jenny or Andy and we'll be fine.
TTW00005214	How's that chem problem treating you?
TTW00005215	Is the Stradivarius worth a ton of caps?
TTW00005216	I hope you're not thinking of doing anything dishonest. You gave me your word.
TTW00005217	Yes, I'd imagine it would fetch an incredible sum of caps to someone that was knowledgeable in musical history.
TTW00005218	I doubt the average merchant would even realize what they're holding.
TTW00005219	What do you know about the Soil Stradivarius?
TTW00005220	Not too much I'm afraid. It was fabricated way back in 1714 by a famous italian craftsman named Antonio Stradivari.
TTW00005221	He had made a bunch of Stradivarius violins actually, and each one was individually named over time to identify them.
TTW00005222	Since the bombs fell laying waste to most of the world, it may be safe to say that this could be the last surviving violin of its kind.
TTW00005223	I need some time to think about it.
TTW00005224	I understand. Please don't mistake my evasiveness for mistrust. I am merely being cautious.
TTW00005225	Take your time, by all means.
TTW00005226	All right. I give you my word I'll do my best to recover a violin for you.
TTW00005227	Oh, I don't think I've been this happy in years! As promised, here's the key to the ammunition box. It's right under the radio table.
TTW00005228	Before you leave, I have some information that may help you. At least a place to begin.
TTW00005229	Oh, I don't think I've been this happy in years!
TTW00005230	I have some information that may help you. At least a place to begin.
TTW00005231	Your husband's radio can broadcast across the entire Capital Wasteland?
TTW00005232	Yes. My husband was very proud of the setup. He tinkered with that thing for years to get it working.
TTW00005233	I've tried to use it to get whatever I need, but I've never gotten a reply.
TTW00005234	Demolition expertise doesn't come cheap. I want 500 caps.
TTW00005235	I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. Dammit, boy! You picked the wrong man to mess with. Now I've got to put you in the ground.
TTW00005236	Actually, Sheriff, I plan on detonating that bomb.
TTW00005237	I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. Dammit, girl! You picked the wrong man to mess with. Now I've got to put you in the ground.
TTW00005238	Actually, Sheriff, I plan on detonating that bomb.
TTW00005239	Does the town have a doctor?
TTW00005240	Yep. He's a bit cranky, but he means well. Just make sure there's something actually wrong with you before you bother him.
TTW00005241	You'll find him down in the plaza at the bottom of the hill, across the way from The Brass Lantern.
TTW00005242	It takes some stones to admit a mistake. Maybe you're not so bad, stranger. Tell you what, buy me a drink sometime and we'll call it even.
TTW00005243	So, what do you want that's worth pissing me off over?
TTW00005244	This has been a Tenpenny Truism.
TTW00005245	The poor man wonders why he is poor. The rich man knows why he is rich.
TTW00005246	And now a Tenpenny Truism.
TTW00005247	You can trust me. I'm a doctor myself.
TTW00005248	All right, I suppose someone with medical training has to have at least a bit of compassion. And maybe you can talk some sense into the boy.
TTW00005249	Nice try. Maybe if you actually had some medical training, we could talk about it.
TTW00005250	I'm only trying to help, Doc.
TTW00005251	All right look, I'm only tellin' you this because you seem like an okay sort and I'm hopin' maybe you can talk some sense into the boy.
TTW00005252	Tell me about the Church.
TTW00005253	For those answers I shall direct you to my husband, Confessor Cromwell.
TTW00005254	What's got you so spooked?
TTW00005255	I mean, they got the guns and they got the muscle. Why don't they just bust down our doors and take us out already?
TTW00005256	We're really in a bad way, and could use some help.
TTW00005257	What are you, some kind of a wimp?
TTW00005258	Look, pal. If you think I'm gonna get my ass shot off playing the hero, you're dead wrong.
TTW00005259	If I know they're coming, I lock myself inside like everyone else. We're really in a bad way, and could use some help.
TTW00005260	Where is the science lab?
TTW00005261	The door on the left goes to the stairwell. From there, just keep heading west.
TTW00005262	At the stern. That's the west end to you.
TTW00005263	What do your parents do?
TTW00005264	The same thing that all parents do! My mom cooks and cleans the house and my dad goes to work with Mr. Wilson.
TTW00005265	They work in the basement, or sometimes in Mr. Wilson's shed. Dad says that when I'm older, I'll come to work with him and learn the family business!
TTW00005266	That's all of 'em.
TTW00005267	Looks that way.
TTW00005268	Negative.
TTW00005269	Now knock that off. You're wasting ammo.
TTW00005270	We need to sweep the area. You think those were all the Uglies in D.C.? You take the east side, I'll go west.
TTW00005271	Once we're inside, then we'll celebrate.
TTW00005272	Yeah, I know. God DAMMIT!!
TTW00005273	Is this the idiot who blew our ambush?
TTW00005274	Good.
TTW00005275	Jennings?
TTW00005276	Just a stray we picked up. The one that blundered into the Uglies over on 42nd.
TTW00005277	All right. It's the usual drill. Reddin, you just do whatever Paladin Vargas says and keep your mouth shut.
TTW00005278	Okay, the outpost is just to the south of us. Colvin, you're the eyes.
TTW00005279	Vargas, Reddin, secure this building.
TTW00005280	It's not your fault, Vargas. Reddin was good enough for the Pride, and she proved it here today.
TTW00005281	When we get back to the Citadel, I'll talk to the scribes. Let it be chronicled that Paladin Reddin passed her test.
TTW00005282	So how'd I do, Vargas? I pass my little trial run? Come on, Lyons' Pride needs me and you know it! That Citadel guard duty is such bullshit.
TTW00005283	Aw, come on. We just kicked their asses!
TTW00005284	Okay, okay.
TTW00005285	Holy shit! What was that?
TTW00005286	I found a Brotherhood Holotag. What should I do with it?
TTW00005287	Talk to Scribe Jameson. She is our keeper of the Scrolls. She will want to know what you have found.
TTW00005288	All clear, Sentinel. Five mutants released from their torment. The rest are keeping their heads down.
TTW00005289	A new recruit?
TTW00005290	Welcome!
TTW00005291	I bet you like to look at butts, don't you?
TTW00005292	Ha ha ha!
TTW00005293	You're all right for a mungo, you know that?
TTW00005294	Why don't you come in. I think we can trust you.
TTW00005295	Yeah, your mom sure likes it.
TTW00005296	Ha ha ha!
TTW00005297	You're pretty funny for a mungo.
TTW00005298	Why don't you come on in?
TTW00005299	Yeah, well at least it doesn't smell as bad as you do.
TTW00005300	Ha ha ha!
TTW00005301	You're pretty funny for a mungo.
TTW00005302	Why don't you come on in?
TTW00005303	I'm here to do business with you.
TTW00005304	Here's a menu.
TTW00005305	Yeah, what do you have?
TTW00005306	If I must.
TTW00005307	For you, I always offer my best price.
TTW00005308	Straight to the point. I like that.
TTW00005309	What'll you have?
TTW00005310	I'll have a drink.
TTW00005311	Commin' up.
TTW00005312	I'll have a drink.
TTW00005313	We've got all kinds of chems.
TTW00005314	What do you have for sale?
TTW00005315	Need to do some killin' eh?
TTW00005316	Can I see what kinds of guns you have for sale?
TTW00005317	Here is our menu, sir.
TTW00005318	I'm hungry.
TTW00005319	Here is our menu, ma'am.
TTW00005320	I'm hungry.
TTW00005321	Let's get high.
TTW00005322	I need some chems.
TTW00005323	After what you did? Only because I have to.
TTW00005324	What have you got to sell?
TTW00005325	Anything for you! You sure fixed Bannon good.
TTW00005326	What have you got to sell?
TTW00005327	I've got a little bit of everything.
TTW00005328	What have you got to sell?
TTW00005329	Whatchya lookin' for?
TTW00005330	I'm thinking of buying some ordnance.
TTW00005331	Take a look at our menu.
TTW00005332	What do you have to eat?
TTW00005333	Please place your order.
TTW00005334	What do you have to eat?
TTW00005335	It's a big world out there, honey, full of all sorts of people. What about you? What kind of person are you going to be?
TTW00005336	It's a big world out there, son, full of all sorts of people. What about you? What kind of person are you going to be?
TTW00005337	You left me there without saying goodbye. What was I supposed to do?
TTW00005338	You were supposed to stay put. You could've had a good life in the Vault.
TTW00005339	But I suppose it's too late to go back now, isn't it? The Overseer would likely have us shot on sight.
TTW00005340	Well then, you'll just have to come with me to Rivet City. You've certainly proven yourself capable enough.
TTW00005341	You can do it!
TTW00005342	Authorized ticketholders, please proceed to the main platform.
TTW00005343	I know, I was thinking about that. The lab at the facility had some old Pre-War computers that we scavenged. One of them might be useful.
TTW00005344	It's as important to me as ever, Madison. I know it's important to you too. Let's finish it together.
TTW00005345	You haven't lost any of your passion, have you James?
TTW00005346	Everyone, listen; it seems we have some visitors. I don't know who they are or what they want.
TTW00005347	I'd like to thank you all for returning to this project after so many years. I know some of you thought; like me, that this day would never come.
TTW00005348	Once the mainframe is online, we'll be able to access the database, and hopefully learn where we can find a G.E.C.K.
TTW00005349	There's a lot of deterioration in the pipes, and some damage to the substructure, but it's nothing we can't fix.
TTW00005350	We've restored power to the mainframe, which is coming online now.
TTW00005351	All right everyone, you should be able to hear me now.
TTW00005352	I think we're out of wine, but I'll check.
TTW00005353	Oh. So you did.
TTW00005354	Not yet, sweetheart. Finish your meal first.
TTW00005355	Don't make a fuss over it. Their just kids. Besides, maybe C.J. will rub off on James and not the other way around.
TTW00005356	Amen. We have each other, and we have C.J.
TTW00005357	The transformer is still touch and go. Doctor Li hopes her most recent tests will be good.
TTW00005358	Give me a Brahmin steak, potato, and a beer.
TTW00005359	Fucking junk heap. I should start eating at Gary's.
TTW00005360	Huh? I don't get it. Never mind. Just buy me another drink.
TTW00005361	Your food is very nourishing, Vera.
TTW00005362	I suppose you're right. Being back here after all this time, I can't help but be a little concerned.
TTW00005363	I'm already taking care of that. I'll let you know if there are any abnormal results.
TTW00005364	Doctor Li asked me to keep an eye on the power relays in level 3, but I'll take care of that for you.
TTW00005365	Yes sir. I'll attend to that in just a moment.
TTW00005366	It's fine, Madison. Everything is taken care of. There's no reason to be nervous.
TTW00005367	We haven't forgotten anything. We're on top of the situation. Come on, we're professionals!
TTW00005368	Make sure to stay in contact with Daniel and Alex. I'm waiting for a report from them.
TTW00005369	When you have a moment, can you check the pressure on tanks 3 and 4? I'm concerned there may be a leak.
TTW00005370	Did we forget to compensate for the power fluctuations in our last calculation? I'd hate to see us short something out now.
TTW00005371	I'm concerned that we're overlooking something, James. I don't want us to be too hasty.
TTW00005372	Yes, Doctor?
TTW00005373	God and Saint Monica hear my sermons. That's good enough for me.
TTW00005374	Head on in, partner. Ya’ll enjoy your stay now.
TTW00005375	Now you've gone and done it.
TTW00005376	Man down!
TTW00005377	They killed him!
TTW00005378	They killed her!
TTW00005379	Look out!
TTW00005380	We'll get 'em.
TTW00005381	Flank 'em!
TTW00005382	They killed him!
TTW00005383	They killed her!
TTW00005384	I'm going to blow you to pieces.
TTW00005385	Stupid shit.
TTW00005386	Oh yeah! That means more for me.
TTW00005387	Let's rock.
TTW00005388	I'm going to make you bleed.
TTW00005389	Alright, it's on now!
TTW00005390	Damn, there goes a big earner.
TTW00005391	Fuck, that's not good.
TTW00005392	I'm gonna kick your ass.
TTW00005393	You wanna piece of this?
TTW00005394	Let's get this goin'.
TTW00005395	We've got a man down here!
TTW00005396	Man down!
TTW00005397	Engaging!
TTW00005398	Go, go, go!
TTW00005399	Time to die, Outsider!
TTW00005400	Roo too nait, ahk iss.
TTW00005401	No! Neekt ni!
TTW00005402	Bastard! You'll pay for that!
TTW00005403	They killed him!
TTW00005404	They killed her!
TTW00005405	Look out!
TTW00005406	We'll get 'em.
TTW00005407	Flank 'em!
TTW00005408	Meaner than a rattlesnake, ain't ya?
TTW00005409	Goldurnit!
TTW00005410	Damn it to hell!
TTW00005411	You'll pay for that!
TTW00005412	Goddamn it!
TTW00005413	Blast it!
TTW00005414	God dammit...
TTW00005415	You'll pay for that!
TTW00005416	Fucker!
TTW00005417	Man down!
TTW00005418	You'll pay for that!
TTW00005419	Press on!
TTW00005420	Keep fighting!
TTW00005421	Partner unit disabled.
TTW00005422	Destruction of law officers is a capital offense.
TTW00005423	Hey! Don't die on me now!
TTW00005424	I wish I could have saved you.
TTW00005425	There will be time to grieve later.
TTW00005426	Let this death mean something.
TTW00005427	Rest in peace, Brother.
TTW00005428	You will be avenged, Brother.
TTW00005429	Damn it!
TTW00005430	Man down!
TTW00005431	Ah, hell.
TTW00005432	Dammit!
TTW00005433	Et in Arcadia ego.
TTW00005434	Oh! Dammit.
TTW00005435	Well, crap.
TTW00005436	Damn!
TTW00005437	Their trouble's all gone.
TTW00005438	Gone to their reward.
TTW00005439	One of ours is down!
TTW00005440	Oh, no! Grandma's little pumpkin! Rraaaargh!
TTW00005441	That zombie's a real corpse now!
TTW00005442	One less of those things to deal with.
TTW00005443	Damn it. I kill one and three more show up!
TTW00005444	How many of these things do we have to kill?
TTW00005445	He's down!
TTW00005446	We was kin!
TTW00005447	You killed him!
TTW00005448	This ain't over yet!
TTW00005449	You'll pay for that!
TTW00005450	Man down!
TTW00005451	Sons of bitches!
TTW00005452	They killed him!
TTW00005453	He's dead!
TTW00005454	They killed her!
TTW00005455	She's dead!
TTW00005456	Man down, man down!
TTW00005457	Bastard! You'll pay for that!
TTW00005458	I'll make you pay for that!
TTW00005459	Damn it!
TTW00005460	Shit. Lost one.
TTW00005461	Gah!
TTW00005462	A Brother has fallen!
TTW00005463	You dare take the life of a Brother of Steel!
TTW00005464	His was a good death.
TTW00005465	Focus, Brothers. Focus on the enemy!
TTW00005466	Let his death not be in vain!
TTW00005467	Hm.
TTW00005468	Hey!
TTW00005469	Hell yeah! How do you like me now!
TTW00005470	Thought you could take me, did you?
TTW00005471	Dead!
TTW00005472	You'll pay for that!
TTW00005473	Bastard!
TTW00005474	Think you can take me down too?
TTW00005475	Keep fighting!
TTW00005476	Press on!
TTW00005477	Die, Profligate!
TTW00005478	Death to the Legion's enemies!
TTW00005479	For Caesar!
TTW00005480	You bastard!
TTW00005481	I'll kill you for that!
TTW00005482	No!
TTW00005483	Made me mad now!
TTW00005484	Try killing me!
TTW00005485	You die next!
TTW00005486	You can't kill us all!
TTW00005487	Nooooo!
TTW00005488	He is fallen!
TTW00005489	Dead! No!
TTW00005490	Man down!
TTW00005491	We've lost one.
TTW00005492	I'll make them pay for that.
TTW00005493	Go in peace, Brother.
TTW00005494	Dumbass.
TTW00005495	More loot for me!
TTW00005496	Dammit! They owed me 50 caps!
TTW00005497	Oh, you're gonna pay for that.
TTW00005498	<sound of spitting>
TTW00005499	Goddamn, I'm glad that wasn't me!
TTW00005500	Now I'm REALLY mad!
TTW00005501	Son of a bitch!
TTW00005502	You'll pay for that!
TTW00005503	This ain't over yet!
TTW00005504	Dammit! That was our fourth for poker!
TTW00005505	Man down! Man down!
TTW00005506	He'll be remembered.
TTW00005507	I will avenge you.
TTW00005508	There's no place for disgrace.
TTW00005509	Man down! Man down!
TTW00005510	Unit down!
TTW00005511	Rest easy, soldier!
TTW00005512	We have a casualty!
TTW00005513	You've done your deed for God and country.
TTW00005514	I can't look!
TTW00005515	No!
TTW00005516	Oh no!
TTW00005517	This can't be happening!
TTW00005518	Please no!
TTW00005519	Somebody help!
TTW00005520	Oh my God!
TTW00005521	No!
TTW00005522	Oh no!
TTW00005523	This can't be happening!
TTW00005524	Please no!
TTW00005525	Somebody help!
TTW00005526	Damnit. I'm just trying to keep the peace.
TTW00005527	Goddamnit. Everyone stand the hell down! Let's solve this peacefully.
TTW00005528	Dead. Great.
TTW00005529	Now I'm pissed.
TTW00005530	Argh!
TTW00005531	There. You see? Natural selection at it's finest.
TTW00005532	Death can be so messy, can't it.
TTW00005533	I hope someone deals with that body soon. I detest the smell of rotting flesh.
TTW00005534	Death is such nasty business.
TTW00005535	Nona! Ud muerna!
TTW00005536	Ud matanna mes!
TTW00005537	Yoo murdah my hainji!
TTW00005538	No! Net yoo!
TTW00005539	Get back!
TTW00005540	Whoa!
TTW00005541	Duck!
TTW00005542	Protect yourself!
TTW00005543	It's live!
TTW00005544	Moooove!
TTW00005545	Heads down!
TTW00005546	Watch out!
TTW00005547	Nooooo!
TTW00005548	Nooooooo!
TTW00005549	What?
TTW00005550	Watch your ass!
TTW00005551	Get away from it!
TTW00005552	I'll get that door open, and then you can let your hordes in.
TTW00005553	Well get going, then! Open the door! What's taking you so damn long? Hurry up!
TTW00005554	Well, maybe I should talk to Tenpenny. There may be a peaceful solution.
TTW00005555	Try it if you like. Go talk to Tenpenny. Ask him he wants us living there. It won't work. So when you fail, we can do it my way.
TTW00005556	Let me try talking to Tenpenny. Maybe he wouldn't mind you living there.
TTW00005557	Ha! Those snooty bitches probably can't stand living with each other, let alone with us.
TTW00005558	But by all means, try talking to Tenpenny if you like. But it won't work. Then we'll do it my way.
TTW00005559	You get that escape door in the Tenpenny basement open, and I'll unleash those ferals on 'em!
TTW00005560	Honey? Over here; the intercom.
TTW00005561	Son? Over here; the intercom.
TTW00005562	Rubbish! You must be daft. Look around! Where else in the Wasteland have you seen such magnificence, I ask you?
TTW00005563	I had the great fortune to run into Mister Burke, an absolute gem of a man. He certainly has a way of getting done what needs to get done, doesn't he?
TTW00005564	Then it was a matter of getting the right type of tenants with the right type of assets, and the rest is, as they say, history.
TTW00005565	Eh. It's okay here.
TTW00005566	I say! Must you be so caustic? Come now, a lot of work went into turning this husk of a tower into a place people can call home.
TTW00005567	I've had help, of course. Especially in Mister Burke, an absolute gem of a man. He certainly has a way of getting done what needs to get done.
TTW00005568	Then it was a matter of getting the right type of tenants with the right type of assets, and the rest is, as they say, history.
TTW00005569	You didn't build this tower, you just found it and moved in. Big fucking deal.
TTW00005570	Righto! When I saw this place jutting up out of the horizon, I knew what I had to do! I hired some muscle and we got this place fixed up right quick.
TTW00005571	I had the great fortune to run into Mister Burke, an absolute gem of a man. He certainly has a way of getting done what needs to get done, doesn't he?
TTW00005572	Then it was a matter of getting the right type of tenants with the right type of assets, and the rest is, as they say, history.
TTW00005573	Indeed! I'm extremely impressed!
TTW00005574	James, this is wrong. You can't do this.
TTW00005575	I won't help you do this James. Not after everything it took to get here.
TTW00005576	I need you to monitor the output levels on pumps three and four. Please step over to the panel and keep an eye on them, will you?
TTW00005577	Madison, please. It's very important that you do this right now. Just step over to the panel while I access the computer in the control booth.
TTW00005578	Please. Just monitor the pumps.
TTW00005579	Wish not so much to live long as to live well!
TTW00005580	The enemy is at the gates! Now is the time for the greatest of rallying cries!
TTW00005581	The enemy will be here soon, you must defend your leader! Remember: Our cause is noble; it is the cause of mankind!
TTW00005582	We cannot allow the enemy to penetrate our defenses any deeper! Old Glory must not be stained with the blood of tyranny!
TTW00005583	Strike now and strike hard. You may delay, but time will not!
TTW00005584	Men! We can't let the enemy's progress dissuade us from our task! We must defend our freedom and our right to be independent!
TTW00005585	As your leader, Button Gwinnett, distinguished representative of Georgia, I promise you I have not yet begun to fight!
TTW00005586	Remember, the will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government, and to protect its free expression should be our first object.
TTW00005587	Men, today I address you with a message of utmost urgency. Our defenses have been breached, and soon we'll engage the enemy.
TTW00005588	Back off, man. That's my stuff.
TTW00005589	Hey buddy, Bar's over here if you need something.
TTW00005590	Whoa, whoa, whoa, hands off the goods.
TTW00005591	I'd put that weapon away if I were you.
TTW00005592	Stacey! Open the gate, and let this mungo in!
TTW00005593	Sure, sounds good. I would have done it for free.
TTW00005594	Yeah right. Good luck soldier. I'm not coming after you to rescue your ass if you get in trouble. You're on your own.
TTW00005595	Roy Phillips and his gang are somewhere in Warrington Station Metro tunnels. They've barred the main entrance. Try going through the train yard.
TTW00005596	I'll take it. And any other help you can offer.
TTW00005597	Here, you can take this rifle and ammo. But don't waste it shooting at shadows.
TTW00005598	Roy Phillips and his gang are somewhere in Warrington Station Metro tunnels. They've barred the main entrance. Try going through the train yard.
TTW00005599	And here. You can take this rifle and ammo.
TTW00005600	But you better not screw this up!
TTW00005601	Roy Phillips and his gang are somewhere in Warrington Station Metro tunnels. They've barred the main entrance. Try going through the train yard.
TTW00005602	Like I tell my men: Don't bother reporting in, unless it's to tell me you got the job done.
TTW00005603	I'm still working on getting rid of Roy Phillips and his pack of Ghouls.
TTW00005604	Really? You? You're welcome to give it a try. But don't come crying to me when you get hurt.
TTW00005605	They've holed up in the nearby metro tunnels. They're living with packs of Feral Ghouls. Be careful, Roy seems damn close to turning zombie himself.
TTW00005606	I suppose you won't be doing this out of the kindness of your heart, huh?
TTW00005607	How's 500 bottlecaps sound? Payable upon termination of that damn Ghoul, Roy Phillips, and all his followers.
TTW00005608	I can help with your Ghoul problem. Where are they hiding out?
TTW00005609	Perhaps the residents could be "persuaded" to let the Ghouls live here.
TTW00005610	You're out of line. Those filthy bitches can stay living in those metro tunnels. They'll move in here over my dead body.
TTW00005611	I don't suppose you've consulted any Ghouls on your little theory?
TTW00005612	Ahem. I advise you to speak more civilly. Perhaps you can go enlighten Chief Gustavo. I have pressing "evil minion" things to do.
TTW00005613	For an evil minion, you're not very bright. You can't "contain" Ghouls.
TTW00005614	If you can do a better job than Chief Gustavo, perhaps you can go enlighten him. I have important matters to attend to. If you'll excuse me?
TTW00005615	Contained? Don't you want a permanent solution?
TTW00005616	That damn Roy Phillips won't take no for an answer. Keeps showing up, looking for a handout. He and his kind aren't wanted. End of story.
TTW00005617	If I were a betting man, I'd place a stack of caps on him trying something violent soon.
TTW00005618	And that would make Tenpenny nervous. I don't like it when Tenpenny gets nervous.
TTW00005619	But I can't spare the manpower to go hunt down Roy Phillips and his band of misfits, or I'd gladly end this thing once and for all.
TTW00005620	How's that Ghoul situation coming along?
TTW00005621	If they got in here, they'd get their filth over everything. You can smell them a mile away!
TTW00005622	I hope they come back and get killed by security.
TTW00005623	Are you afraid of the Ghouls trying to get into Tenpenny?
TTW00005624	They were told they can't live here. But those zombies are too stupid to understand.
TTW00005625	They live in their own filth, squatting in the nearby metro tunnel. Security keeps shooting them, but they keep coming back.
TTW00005626	Are you worried about those Ghouls?
TTW00005627	Don't you worry about any such thing, sir. Care to wet your whistle?
TTW00005628	You know anything about those Ghouls trying to get in here?
TTW00005629	I'm sure it will end in bloodshed. It's serious business, comrade.
TTW00005630	What do you think of the whole situation with the Ghouls?
TTW00005631	They're living in the nearby tunnels. They scare me!
TTW00005632	Why doesn't somebody do something!
TTW00005633	You know anything about these Ghouls?
TTW00005634	Are you going to do something about the problem, or not?
TTW00005635	Those Ghouls sure have people worked up, don't they?
TTW00005636	Some Ghouls moved into the nearby Metro tunnel. There's a bunch of the so-called Feral Ghouls in there, but a handful seem the sociable type.
TTW00005637	I've tried explaining to my fellow tenants that not all Ghouls are monsters. But they don't seem to care.
TTW00005638	The intelligent ones should stay away from our trigger happy protectors. If there're enough feral ones though, they could overwhelm security.
TTW00005639	Are you doing something about those Ghouls?
TTW00005640	Chief Gustavo assures us that he's increased the number of the security team, and will kill any zombies on sight.
TTW00005641	Those Ghouls have you stressed out, too?
TTW00005642	We haven't discussed this already? Apparently there's a pack of zombies living in the tunnels. Gustavo says he has it under control.
TTW00005643	On the bright side, it's given me another reason to hit the drink!
TTW00005644	I don't suppose you know much about those Ghouls?
TTW00005645	There's a pack of zombies living nearby in some old tunnel. They asked to move in. Naturally, they were told to go to hell.
TTW00005646	Gustavo's hired some additional goons. Seems to be working. Still, makes one a bit fidgety having those loathsome creatures around.
TTW00005647	I wouldn't even want them as slaves!
TTW00005648	Do you know anything useful about those Ghouls?
TTW00005649	Hear anything interesting about the Ghouls?
TTW00005650	My current theory is that the destructive disease of the Ghoul condition will always eventually render him little more than a mindless killer.
TTW00005651	The proverbial Wasteland "zombie" with a predilection for raw human flesh.
TTW00005652	They can't be cured. And there's nothing to alleviate the symptoms. All in all, it seems rather sad, really.
TTW00005653	Know much about those Ghouls?
TTW00005654	What's it like living at Tenpenny Tower?
TTW00005655	It's a piece of Utopia jutting up from the Wasteland. Tenpenny is a true visionary. I do my part to assist him in unfolding his Master Plan.
TTW00005656	This tower is the symbol of true progress in this world! People are dying to get in here. Just ask those Ghouls.
TTW00005657	Go for the top shelf. On me. <Give 20 caps.>
TTW00005658	Whoa, twenty caps! Look at the big spender! Alright then, I can see you're in it for the big money, so I'll tell you all about Moriarty's.
TTW00005659	Moriarty, he's a ratfuck bastard for sure, but he's also paranoid as all hell. So paranoid that he don't let no one handle the cash around here.
TTW00005660	Every night, he takes what Gob and Nova earn and locks it in a file cabinet next to his bed.
TTW00005661	Don't you know how a bribe works? You give me money, and I give you information. In order to do that, you have to have money. Christ. Kids!
TTW00005662	This should buy you something. <Give 10 caps.>
TTW00005663	Ha ha! You're gonna have to do better than that, kid! Thanks for the drink, though.
TTW00005664	What if all your other neighbors agree?
TTW00005665	Don't care. The only way those Ghouls are getting in is over my dead body.
TTW00005666	Would you tell Mister Tenpenny that you wouldn't mind Ghoul neighbors?
TTW00005667	I guess so.
TTW00005668	Ha! I don't suppose I'd mind terribly if Ghouls were to live here. And it'd be a good bit of sport hunting them down if they misbehaved.
TTW00005669	I dare say though, you'll have a bit of trouble convincing certain residents to go along with your novel proposition.
TTW00005670	Tell you what. If you can convince Mr. and Mrs. Wellington, Mr. Ling, Ms. Montenegro, and Ms. Lancaster, those Ghouls can live here.
TTW00005671	Have you seen me shoot? I'm quite proficient, if I do say so myself.
TTW00005672	What if the residents are okay with Ghoul neighbors?
TTW00005673	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
TTW00005674	I'm afraid I can't abide by that. I can't imagine Tenpenny would allow it. But I certainly won't.
TTW00005675	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
TTW00005676	Ha! I think I know a fair share more than some vagrant blown in off the Wastes. You are simply mistaken.
TTW00005677	They may appear nice, but deep down they want to kill. It's common knowledge among the educated.
TTW00005678	You clearly don't know what you are talking about!
TTW00005679	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
TTW00005680	I suppose I wouldn't mind too terribly. It'd give me a chance to study Ghoul physiology.
TTW00005681	I've met these Ghouls. They seem healthy. All things considered.
TTW00005682	I think you must have been out in the sun too long. Perhaps I could sell you a nice hat to keep your brain from frying?
TTW00005683	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
TTW00005684	Why would you hang out with dirty vermin like that? You enjoy sifting through feces?
TTW00005685	You know it's only a matter of time before they get hungry and eat you. You're crazy. Ghouls will never live in Tenpenny Tower.
TTW00005686	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
TTW00005687	Well, perhaps you're right, comrade. Some of these folk have a few things to learn about camaraderie, that's for sure.
TTW00005688	Comrade, I've met these Ghouls. They seem friendly enough. More than this lot.
TTW00005689	And if they do anything stupid, I'm sure they'll get kicked out. Fine, it's ok.
TTW00005690	I've met these Ghouls. They seem friendly enough.
TTW00005691	Well, if you don't mind their stink, then you should go squat with them in their dirty tunnels, and leave us civilized people alone.
TTW00005692	I've met these Ghouls. They aren't so bad.
TTW00005693	How would you feel about having a few Ghoul neighbors?
TTW00005694	HELL NO! Tenpenny won't allow it. And I take my orders from him.
TTW00005695	After Tenpenny died, I assumed full command. And since I hate Ghouls, I guess the answer to that question is pretty damn clear.
TTW00005696	Those Ghouls can live here over my goddamn body!
TTW00005697	However, the Ghoulish state is a bitter reminder that things aren't yet in line with Mister Tenpenny's vision for a pure and stainless future.
TTW00005698	So you see, Ghouls living here is simply out of the question.
TTW00005699	I know you've been pressuring people into allowing Ghouls to live here.
TTW00005700	Who do you think you are, harassing honest people like that? You should be ashamed of yourself! I certainly won't allow Ghouls to live here.
TTW00005701	My neighbors might be out of their minds, but I am not. Those Ghouls will NOT be living here.
TTW00005702	Ah yes. I was wondering when you'd try me.
TTW00005703	You may be able to coerce the others, but I'm not such a pushover. Your zombie buddies will need to find someplace else to live.
TTW00005704	It's my turn, eh? Well, you won't be getting me to go along with your ridiculous plan.
TTW00005705	Ghouls aren't human. They live in filth. They eat their own babies. You're out of your right freaking mind!
TTW00005706	I know all about your plan to get your Ghoul pals in here, and I'm putting a stop to it. You can't just go around pushing us around like that!
TTW00005707	So you can run along and tell your Ghouls they'll just have to find somewhere else to squat. Or better yet, to go off and die somewhere.
TTW00005708	And I've decided that I'd be willing to give it a go. Having Ghoul neighbors, I mean.
TTW00005709	Who knows, I could even publish my findings!
TTW00005710	You've finally got around to asking me, comrade.
TTW00005711	I've given it a lot of careful thought. I would welcome these Ghouls into our community.
TTW00005712	I've already formed a welcoming committee!
TTW00005713	It's my turn, eh? I'm still worried, but if the others are willing to let them live here, I guess I could try it. But they better behave!
TTW00005714	I've heard they carry diseases. I'd have to sanitize everything after them all the time. Besides, they are dangerous, aren't they?
TTW00005715	You've heard the stories I'm sure. About the mindless ones eating brains and the like. Well, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with all that.
TTW00005716	Haha. You're joking right? You're serious? Of course not! Ghouls can't live here. They're dirty loathsome creatures.
TTW00005717	Dear lord. Are you serious? Ghouls living here? With us? That's simply out of the question.
TTW00005718	I'm not sure. My first responsibility is the health and welfare of the residents of Tenpenny Tower.
TTW00005719	Ghouls often carry diseases due to radiation damaging their immune systems.
TTW00005720	You're being serious? That's out of the question. What an absurd notion!
TTW00005721	You can't be serious. Ghouls aren't human. They live in filth. They eat their own babies. You're out of your right freakin' mind!
TTW00005722	Don't have any data in my files about that.
TTW00005723	Ghouls wouldn't make the best of neighbors, comrade.
TTW00005724	I don't know. I mean, they're all deformed and scary looking. I bet they're really mean, too.
TTW00005725	I've come too far to share my digs with some droopy Ghoul!
TTW00005726	Well, I wouldn't mind. But they'd better be civilized. The tenants here are real uppity and most wouldn't take kindly to Ghouls living here.
TTW00005727	I've already told you no!
TTW00005728	I believe I've told you NO!
TTW00005729	It's not happening.
TTW00005730	I will not allow Ghouls to live here.
TTW00005731	I'm really tired of you and your Ghoul crusade.
TTW00005732	I wouldn't mind. It would certainly liven things up around here, that's for sure!
TTW00005733	Oh what the hell? It's not like anything interesting happens around here anyway.
TTW00005734	It would give me a chance to do my own study of Ghoul physiology.
TTW00005735	It's not really fair to deprive anyone of a community, is it? So we really ought to welcome them as comrades, shouldn't we?
TTW00005736	If they behave, I suppose it'd be okay with me.
TTW00005737	Funny. I'll take my caps back now.
TTW00005738	Thanks for the info, Jericho.
TTW00005739	Anytime. It'll be worth it to see the look on that asshole's face.
TTW00005740	Sounds risky. What if he catches me?
TTW00005741	He'll probably blow your head off. That is, unless you can draw faster than a pissed off Irishman.
TTW00005742	Why haven't you robbed him?
TTW00005743	My robbin' days are over, kid. I'm just here to drink and stink.
TTW00005744	So where's the key?
TTW00005745	Well, I must speak to my husband about that. We could bring it up at the next homeowner's association meeting.
TTW00005746	Ah, I do love meetings so much. I think I'll bring muffins!
TTW00005747	I never thought about it that way. Can you hook me up?
TTW00005748	I'll only sell to you when my shift is over. Meet me in the water treatment plant if you need something.
TTW00005749	I'm running short on time, here. Let's cut to the chase.
TTW00005750	I elected to take time from my responsibilities to assist you. Perhaps I was in error. Nonetheless, we may have what you seek.
TTW00005751	In the archives upstairs is an old, Pre-War Vault-Tec terminal. I will send word that you need access to it.
TTW00005752	I'd like to help, but nothing's free.
TTW00005753	Heh heh. Spoken just like a merc.
TTW00005754	You get us off of here, and I guarantee you'll be paid well.
TTW00005755	Now, I'd suggest we go back the way you came, but I think that may be impossible. Our only chance is this express elevator to the lobby level.
TTW00005756	Yeah, let's do it.
TTW00005757	I know you don't know me from the shit under your boots, but I promise you when we get out of this you'll be paid well for it.
TTW00005758	I'd suggest we go back the way you came, but I think that may be impossible. Our only chance is this express elevator to the lobby level.
TTW00005759	I don't know a Reilly, and I'm out of here.
TTW00005760	Well, I got news for you. You're stuck up here like the rest of us. There's no going back the way you came.
TTW00005761	So what'll it be? You going to help us get off this roof or what?
TTW00005762	I don't know any Reilly, but I do know we need to get the hell off this roof.
TTW00005763	She didn't send you? Dammit, that means she might be dead.
TTW00005764	Forget it then, we can talk shop later. Can you help us get out of here?
TTW00005765	Reilly? Who's that? Never heard of her.
TTW00005766	She's our commander. I hope she's still alive. When I saw you come up here, I assumed she'd sent you.
TTW00005767	Well, we can chit-chat about all that later. Right now, can you help us get off this damn roof?
TTW00005768	Please. Like I'm afraid of you people.
TTW00005769	See? That. Right there. That's the sort of shit that'll land a little girl like you in the infirmary.
TTW00005770	See? That. Right there. That's the sort of shit that gets a man injured.
TTW00005771	Brothers, today I offer a simple prayer.
TTW00005772	Hail, Creator. Blessed is your power and mighty is your gift of Steel.
TTW00005773	Bless us today, your noble warriors who dwell in this hall.
TTW00005774	Let us ride upon wings of thunder and chariots of glory, to bring destruction to your enemies.
TTW00005775	To bring destruction upon your wicked enemies."
TTW00005776	Brothers, as we take our meal this day, let us reflect upon the words of Elder Patrocolus of the Montana Bunker.
TTW00005777	Pledge in your hearts and minds, pledge by your guns that you will stand with them in battle until the end. Trust each of them with your life.
TTW00005778	And earn the trust of each in turn. Eat well, my friends.
TTW00005779	Can you repair my gear?
TTW00005780	I'd like to buy something.
TTW00005781	What do you need?
TTW00005782	What is it?
TTW00005783	What else would I be doing back here?
TTW00005784	Hang on a second. I have a letter for Ian West from his sister.
TTW00005785	Oh, the new kid? Yeah, Vance said we should be expecting someone soon.
TTW00005786	You can head on in, but I would speak to Vance first if I was you. You can find him on the mezzanine overlooking the common area.
TTW00005787	I'm not telling you jack. Now let me get by!
TTW00005788	Oh, sure. Look, I don't have time for your bullshit. Turn around and go back the way you came.
TTW00005789	Otherwise, they'll be scraping you up with a shovel.
TTW00005790	I'm going to kick your ass all over this Metro station if you don't help me!
TTW00005791	Finally! Someone with some balls around this place!
TTW00005792	I have no idea.
TTW00005793	Then that is a mystery you will have to solve on your own.
TTW00005794	Perhaps from these Laws you can discover what we are. Return to me when you are ready.
TTW00005795	That's terrific! A real man of action. That's just what we need!
TTW00005796	I could take a whole pack of Ghouls without breaking a sweat.
TTW00005797	That's terrific! That's just what we need!
TTW00005798	I could take a whole pack of Ghouls without breaking a sweat.
TTW00005799	Not very lively are you? Perhaps you're just bored. You should go on an adventure. Nothing like a little bit of the unknown to motivate a person.
TTW00005800	<Say nothing.>
TTW00005801	I need to leave. Can you open the gate?
TTW00005802	Follow me.
TTW00005803	Yes ma'am.
TTW00005804	I heard that Rivet City is run by some sort of Council?
TTW00005805	Chief Harkness meets with Doctor Li and Bannon to discuss security matters.
TTW00005806	It's a waste of a good Monday morning if you ask me. They should just let Chief Harkness call the shots.
TTW00005807	Chief Danvers meets with Doctor Li and Bannon to discuss how to run this tub.
TTW00005808	It's a waste of a good Monday morning if you ask me. They should just let Chief Harkness call the shots.
TTW00005809	Doctor Li, Chief Harkness and I are all on the council. We meet every Monday morning.
TTW00005810	I can be very influential, if you know what I mean. Far more than Seagrave Holmes.
TTW00005811	So you're on the City Council.
TTW00005812	Doctor Li, Chief Harkness and I are all on the council. We meet every Monday morning.
TTW00005813	I can be very influential, if you know what I mean.
TTW00005814	So you're on the City Council.
TTW00005815	Doctor Li, Chief Danvers and I are all on the council. We meet every Monday morning.
TTW00005816	I can be very influential, if you know what I mean. Far more than Seagrave Holmes.
TTW00005817	So you're on the City Council.
TTW00005818	Doctor Li, Chief Danvers and I are all on the council. We meet every Monday morning.
TTW00005819	I can be very influential, if you know what I mean.
TTW00005820	So you're on the City Council.
TTW00005821	Bannon and Doctor Li and I all meet on Monday mornings to talk about city wide issues.
TTW00005822	It's pretty informal. The council doesn't have much real power.
TTW00005823	I heard you're on some sort of City Council.
TTW00005824	I heard Angela Staley has a crush on Diego.
TTW00005825	Father Clifford expelled Diego. So now we can get married!
TTW00005826	So how are things with Diego lately?
TTW00005827	Never mind. It doesn't matter what Angela thinks. Soon I will take vows of chastity.
TTW00005828	I hear Angela Staley has a crush on you.
TTW00005829	Yea, your suffering shall exist no longer; it shall be washed away in Atom's Glow, burned from you in the fire of his brilliance.
TTW00005830	What are you up to?
TTW00005831	Well, now that we brought back the Declaration, I think I'll take my cut of the earnings and head out to get drunk.
TTW00005832	Look me up in the Underworld if you ever need me. I usually hang there since the Ghouls don't hit on me all the time.
TTW00005833	I don't have 300 caps.
TTW00005834	Well, that's a shame for you, isn't it? You don't have the caps, and I guess I don't have the information. Disappointment all around.
TTW00005835	You weren't kidding. You love the smack, all right.
TTW00005836	I'm taking food out of the mouths of some poor dealer's kids right now, you know.
TTW00005837	That burning sensation you feel, all over your body? That's my patented Addiction-Be-Gone treatment at work!
TTW00005838	You alright up there. Need another painkiller?
TTW00005839	All right, here's your caps.
TTW00005840	Hey! If you don't have the caps, you don't get the fix.
TTW00005841	Actually, I don't have 100 caps.
TTW00005842	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
TTW00005843	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
TTW00005844	I'd like to help, but the supplies aren't free. Sorry.
TTW00005845	Actually, I don't have 150 caps.
TTW00005846	For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
TTW00005847	Actually, I don't have the caps.
TTW00005848	All right, here's your caps.
TTW00005849	Hey! If you don't have the caps, you don't get the fix.
TTW00005850	Actually, I don't have 75 caps.
TTW00005851	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
TTW00005852	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
TTW00005853	I'd like to help, but the supplies aren't free. Sorry.
TTW00005854	Actually, I don't have 100 caps.
TTW00005855	For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
TTW00005856	Actually, I don't have the caps.
TTW00005857	That's all I need.
TTW00005858	Okay then. Try not to get killed out there.
TTW00005859	Glad to be able to help.
TTW00005860	Let's get on with it then.
TTW00005861	Yeah? What is it?
TTW00005862	All right, here's your caps.
TTW00005863	Here, bite down on this. It'll help with the pain.
TTW00005864	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
TTW00005865	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
TTW00005866	You should come back and see me when you have enough money for the supplies.
TTW00005867	Actually, I don't have 75 caps.
TTW00005868	For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
TTW00005869	Actually, I don't have the caps.
TTW00005870	If you're the acolyte, who's the priest?
TTW00005871	There's a church in Rivet City?
TTW00005872	Do you actually do anything here in Rivet City?
TTW00005873	You mean, like fix stuff? Nah.
TTW00005874	I just hang out, dude. I've got enough chems to last a while. Oh, yeah!
TTW00005875	You seem pretty relaxed.
TTW00005876	No point in getting all worked up. I get three squares, I got a place to crash, and nothing's trying to eat me.
TTW00005877	So, you report to Chief Harkness?
TTW00005878	I'm his second in command. I run the night shift and he runs the day shift.
TTW00005879	Is this conversation going somewhere? Because I've got things to do.
TTW00005880	No, sir. I'm just here to drink and talk.
TTW00005881	Let's keep it that way.
TTW00005882	Belle can mix almost anything, as long as it's beer or whiskey.
TTW00005883	Why wouldn't I remember you?
TTW00005884	Nobody does. I'm not very memorable.
TTW00005885	Don't worry, it won't be a problem for much longer.
TTW00005886	You're a priest?
TTW00005887	Let me think about it.
TTW00005888	Sure. Here's 5 caps. Go ahead and pick your poison.
TTW00005889	Whoa! Why is the room spinning?
TTW00005890	You're nice. I can tell you a secret. I'm drunk. No no, that's not the secret. I have another secret.
TTW00005891	No, I haven't seen him.
TTW00005892	Figures.
TTW00005893	I'm going to the Muddy Rudder for a drink later. If I see you down there, you can buy me a drink.
TTW00005894	Red's fine. Let's go!
TTW00005895	Alright, if you say so boss. But if we get to Big Town and she isn't there, I'll kill you.
TTW00005896	Come on, let's get out of here.
TTW00005897	Alright! Move it!
TTW00005898	That sucks! Really? She's dead? Damnit. Let's get out of here, and maybe we can kill a few Super Mutants on the way out! Come on!
TTW00005899	Red's dead.
TTW00005900	The Super Mutants took Red along with the others. She was the only person that really ever listened to me.
TTW00005901	Don't tell Sticky, though. He's liable to kill himself if he knew Red was gone. And that would conflict with my own suicide plans.
TTW00005902	Good choice. Pride has taken down more Brothers than I can count. You'd best remember that.
TTW00005903	Are you part of the Railroad? What do you know about this android?
TTW00005904	He's one of God's creatures, just like you and I.
TTW00005905	He wanted new memories and a new face. Sadly, I couldn't help him. He left to look for a tech, someone with Pre-War skills.
TTW00005906	I know you're part of the Railroad. What do you know about the android?
TTW00005907	You know anything about the mind wipe on that escaped android?
TTW00005908	Some say it was all a hoax. But they're wrong. I've seen diagrams of that Neuralizer, it's real. And so is that android!
TTW00005909	I found some info on a Circuit Neuralizer. Care to elaborate?
TTW00005910	I used to think it was all so much bullshit. But then I got this holotape. Here, listen to it yourself.
TTW00005911	You know who might have a Lipoplasticator or Micro Dermal Graftilizer?
TTW00005912	I heard old Pinkerton at Rivet City had a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
TTW00005913	I heard old Pinkerton at Rivet City had a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
TTW00005914	Probably down at Rivet City. Anything that has any use out here, they snatch up for themselves. That damn Pinkerton don't share nothin'.
TTW00005915	Dammit! Why are you wasting my time? I already told you, ask Pinkerton down at Rivet City.
TTW00005916	They say old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow got his hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. Amazing really.
TTW00005917	They say old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow got his hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. Amazing really.
TTW00005918	Try Pinkerton at Rivet City. Heard he has the goods. Hope he doesn't try to actually use them on anyone. Bet he would though. He's nuts.
TTW00005919	Try Pinkerton at Rivet City. Heard he has the goods. Hope he doesn't try to actually use them on anyone. Bet he would though. He's nuts.
TTW00005920	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech. He might have what you're looking for.
TTW00005921	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech. He might have what you're looking for.
TTW00005922	I heard a rumor that old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow conjured up a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
TTW00005923	I heard a rumor that old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow conjured up a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
TTW00005924	Rumor had it Pinkerton at Rivet City found a Lipoplasticator and Graftilizer. Good luck to any fool that let Pinkerton test them on him though.
TTW00005925	Rumor had it Pinkerton at Rivet City found a Lipoplasticator and Graftilizer. Good luck to any fool that let Pinkerton test them on him though.
TTW00005926	Old Pinkerton over at Rivet City's rumored to have done it. Damn fool. High risk of infection and death. Though, I admit, I'm slightly jealous.
TTW00005927	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
TTW00005928	If you are lookin' to change your face, I'd try Pinkerton at Rivet City. That boy's got no sense of ethics. And you're a fool if you try it.
TTW00005929	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
TTW00005930	Pinkerton's the only surgeon crazy enough to try it. Too risky. Go to Rivet City if you want. But don't expect to come out looking better than me.
TTW00005931	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
TTW00005932	I tell these assholes to just stop looking in the mirror. But if you want to mess up your face, try Pinkerton at Rivet City. He's crazy enough.
TTW00005933	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
TTW00005934	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech and knows how to use it. He could probably rearrange your face for you if you wanted.
TTW00005935	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
TTW00005936	Pinkerton's the only surgeon crazy enough to try a facial reconstruction. I'd advise my patients against it. Due to high risk of deadly infection.
TTW00005937	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
TTW00005938	I know it's foolish to cut into the body unnecessarily. Leads to infection. Heard Pinkerton's willing to give it a try though. Try him at Rivet City.
TTW00005939	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
TTW00005940	Ever do any facial surgery? Maybe on someone from the Commonwealth?
TTW00005941	Need specialized equipment and expertise. It's also prone to infection. Too dangerous.
TTW00005942	Medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity. Hey, but that reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
TTW00005943	What do you know about this android from the Commonwealth?
TTW00005944	Have you heard the so called "android recording?" Didn't know what to make it of myself. Here's a spare copy of that old holotape. Take a listen.
TTW00005945	I had forgotten about that old hoax. Have you heard it? Here's a copy of that old "android holotape." It's just some practical jokester.
TTW00005946	This could be an opportunity of a lifetime for you! I've misplaced some very sensitive property. And you will help me find it!
TTW00005947	I'm listening.
TTW00005948	How amusing. You've mistaken my metaphor for a derogatory remark. I need a local, you see. Someone with verve.
TTW00005949	I've misplaced some very sensitive "property."
TTW00005950	You have a problem with the way I look?
TTW00005951	To the point. I like that. Well, as it turns out, I've misplaced some very sensitive "property."
TTW00005952	That depends. What exactly are we talking about, here?
TTW00005953	You seem nervous, kid. Do I make you nervous?
TTW00005954	And when we do, they're usually visiting Brothers. Outsiders are not to be trusted, so says the codex.
TTW00005955	"Shield yourself from those not bound to you by steel, for they are the blind. Aid them when you can, but lose not sight of yourself".
TTW00005956	So what do you think? Can we take these Enclave guys?
TTW00005957	Does this sound noble enough? "Quail before me, foul Super Mutant! Thine end is at hand! Yield, that I may ease thine suffering!"
TTW00005958	To find my Dad, I'm ready for anything.
TTW00005959	Good, 'cause this isn't going to be easy.
TTW00005960	Galaxy News Radio is my baby. I love it, I feed it, I keep it changed. But there's one problem, no one outside of D.C. can hear her cry.
TTW00005961	You see, some brainless Super Mutant thought it would be funny to shoot at the shiny round thing on the Washington Monument.
TTW00005962	I'm ready for anything.
TTW00005963	Good, 'cause this isn't going to be easy.
TTW00005964	Galaxy News Radio is my baby. I love it, I feed it, I keep it changed. But there's one problem, no one outside of D.C. can hear her cry.
TTW00005965	You see, some brainless Super Mutant thought it would be funny to shoot at the shiny round thing on the Washington Monument.
TTW00005966	Just wipe that stupid look off your face and answer my questions!
TTW00005967	Whoa, whoa. Smoke a peace pipe. Take a deep breath and count to ten. Whatever it is you need to do to calm down.
TTW00005968	You need Three Dog's help, and Three Dog needs your help. Let's get together and make it work.
TTW00005969	You don't seem like you have much to offer if you spend all your time up here.
TTW00005970	Hey, I may be the biggest mouth in the Capital Wasteland, but I've also got the biggest ears.
TTW00005971	All sorts of people pass through our little oasis in the rubble and tell all sorts of interesting things.
TTW00005972	You want to know something? Ask and we'll work it out.
TTW00005973	So, what's your story?
TTW00005974	Three Dog's seen it all. The Capital Wasteland at its ugliest.
TTW00005975	People killed for scraps of food, wounded children wandering aimlessly. Some seriously fucked up shit.
TTW00005976	If it wasn't for the Good Fight, I think I would have gone crazy by now.
TTW00005977	Tell me more about this relay.
TTW00005978	Well, if you check out your radio, you can hear pretty good in this place. Get a few blocks away, still not too bad, maybe a little static.
TTW00005979	With the relay back on, you'll hear GNR clearly in the whole Capital Wasteland area like it used to be.
TTW00005980	And what makes you so certain about that? I can't imagine you're still so naive after spending time in that hell outside.
TTW00005981	None of them know what the outside is like, and most of them would die out there. Then the rest of us inside would eventually die out, too.
TTW00005982	I won't risk all of our lives just for a few people's passing fancy of taking a Wasteland vacation. I hope you can understand that.
TTW00005983	The Vault doesn't have to be isolated in order to keep its residents safe.
TTW00005984	That would be where you're wrong. By locking down this Vault, I'm protecting its future.
TTW00005985	In fact, I was protecting its future when I had to make those unpleasant choices the night you and your father abandoned us.
TTW00005986	I only wish I could have stopped your father before he left. If anyone's to blame for the unpleasantness, it's him.
TTW00005987	With your leadership, no one in this Vault has much of a future.
TTW00005988	The way I see it, if you and the rebels are dead, all these problems are over.
TTW00005989	What?
TTW00005990	There's only one solution, here. Death, and lots of it. You get to be first!
TTW00005991	Let's just say it's in your best interest to tell me what I want to know.
TTW00005992	Fine, whatever. This android, calls himself Harkness now, comes in and wants a memory job. I took new memories, and replaced his old ones.
TTW00005993	Don't believe anyone's done that before. Certainly not down here. That Commonwealth tech isn't all that fancy when it comes down to it.
TTW00005994	I'm also the only one in the wasteland with the skill and the nerve to perform facial surgery. That android flesh ain't so different than ours.
TTW00005995	You want proof? I documented the whole thing. So I could rub it in the face of Dr. Li when I need to rankle her feathers. I hate that snooty bitch.
TTW00005996	I've found your android. It's Harkness, Rivet City's security chief!
TTW00005997	Thank you for your discreet assistance, and continued discretion regarding this matter.
TTW00005998	And now for your payment. This combat module will directly affect your central nervous system. I think you will find it quite beneficial.
TTW00005999	You're helping me retrieve this android! Aren't you?
TTW00006000	I've tracked him this far. He's out there, somewhere. In the Capital Wasteland.
TTW00006001	He must have done something drastic, like facial surgery and a mind wipe, or else I would have found him by now.
TTW00006002	It will be no easy task. He may not even realize he's an android. Don't upset him by talking with him. Just come get me immediately. I'll handle it.
TTW00006003	Ah, a woman of action. I knew I picked the right person for the job! Let me be clear, you won't be looking for a lost puppy or family heirloom.
TTW00006004	You'll be searching for an android! Do you know what an android is? No, I imagine you don't.
TTW00006005	You see, we've moved beyond those primitive buckets you call robots, and have created Artificial Intelligence. Sentient machines!
TTW00006006	Artificial persons that think and feel what we program them to. Occasionally their programming miscalculates, they get confused and wander off.
TTW00006007	Cut to the chase, Zimmer. What's the job?
TTW00006008	You think I asked those Super Mutants to wait until I got all my caps together before abducting me?
TTW00006009	Don't get me wrong. I'm terribly grateful. I'll gladly give you a reward. But let's get out of here first.
TTW00006010	"Thanks"? That's all I get for risking my life to save you? How about some caps?
TTW00006011	Okay, I'll help you.
TTW00006012	Then let's get out of here! Don't forget we've got to get Red, too. She's still upstairs in the holding pens.
TTW00006013	You don't have to tell me twice. Let's get out of here!
TTW00006014	What makes you think I'm here to rescue you?
TTW00006015	That isn't funny! We've got to get out of here before the Super Mutants come back to have me for lunch!
TTW00006016	Hold on, short stuff. Who are you and what are you doing here?
TTW00006017	What does it look like? The Super Mutants raided Big Town and dragged me off here. I'm sure they're about to eat me. You can't just leave me here!
TTW00006018	Yeah, it's jammed good. I can't help you.
TTW00006019	Sure can. Here, just pull this back to clear the chamber.
TTW00006020	Sure can. Here, just pull this back to clear the chamber.
TTW00006021	What's in it for me?
TTW00006022	Typical. You wasteland dogs have no honor. Very well, I will pay you 100 caps for your aid.
TTW00006023	Is the initiate still alive?
TTW00006024	He's had enough training that he should know that when facing overwhelming odds, a Brother's best recourse is to wait for reinforcements.
TTW00006025	I suspect that he is making a stand inside of that building, but an Initiate won't be able to stand for long against those Mutants.
TTW00006026	Ooh! That hurt! Do us all a favor and just run away from home.
TTW00006027	I'll show you. I'll show all of you!
TTW00006028	When I'm gone, my mom will really miss me.
TTW00006029	Your mother's a bitch and you're a spoiled little punk.
TTW00006030	I've met your mother. No wonder you're such a brat.
TTW00006031	Poor James. His mother drinks too much. When she does, she doesn't treat him very well.
TTW00006032	Personally, I think she blames him for his father leaving her, which is ridiculous.
TTW00006033	What's the deal with that little punk, James Hargrave?
TTW00006034	James' mom, Tammy, is a real bitch. She treats him like crap.
TTW00006035	I think it's because she drinks too much.
TTW00006036	Why is James Hargrave such a brat?
TTW00006037	That poor child. His mother, Tammy Hargrave, is a very troubled woman.
TTW00006038	She spends too much time down in the Muddy Rudder, drinking and using foul language.
TTW00006039	I feel so sorry for him. I think CJ is a good influence on him, but I do worry about the two of them.
TTW00006040	Why do you let that James Hargrave kid play with your daughter?
TTW00006041	He's trouble, that's what he is.
TTW00006042	I don't trust him, and neither should you.
TTW00006043	His mother is a drunk. Spends all her time in the Muddy Rudder.
TTW00006044	What's up with that James Hargrave kid? He acts like such a brat.
TTW00006045	Actually, I was hoping you'd let me kill him.
TTW00006046	Don't think this gives you license to run around shooting anyone you want. Just Zimmer, and that bodyguard, if he gets in the way.
TTW00006047	Here, use my weapon. I've had it forever, and it's never let me down. Consider it a token of my appreciation.
TTW00006048	Shit. I've got a Council meeting.
TTW00006049	Time for the Council meeting. Don't want to be late.
TTW00006050	What's this building for?
TTW00006051	You got a Pip-Boy. Tune into Galaxy News Radio and listen. It's the only radio station in the Capital Wasteland that really tells it like it is.
TTW00006052	Pretty dire, huh? Thanks for completely ruining my day.
TTW00006053	Why would they be looking for me? I haven't done anything.
TTW00006054	This isn't about some stupid prank. Your dad left the Vault somehow, and now my father's gone crazy. Jonas is dead!
TTW00006055	So you'd better listen to me and get moving if you don't want to end up like him!
TTW00006056	Power systems are 90% at startup, but are running at 37% efficiency after coming fully online. I'm looking into what might be causing the leak.
TTW00006057	Damn it. Well, he's not loaded but I still don't like the idea of him viewing us all as targets. See if you can lock it down.
TTW00006058	All right. How can I help?
TTW00006059	One of the Brotherhood guys that passed through here mentioned seeing a dish in one of D.C.'s old museums.
TTW00006060	It's the dish off the old Virgo II Lunar Lander in the Museum of Technology.
TTW00006061	I want you to get it and bring it to the Washington Monument to replace the bad one. That's it.
TTW00006062	I'm not playing any more of your games.
TTW00006063	Yes sir! I'll have the techs come down and remove it immediately, sir.
TTW00006064	What Order are you a part of?
TTW00006065	Actually, I am proctor of the Order of the Quill. I oversee the Archives and Library here in the Citadel.
TTW00006066	We are dedicated to preserving the history of the Brotherhood as well as unearthing the secrets of the Pre-War civilizations.
TTW00006067	We have a single field associate: Scribe Yearling. She operates out of the former Library of Congress to the northeast.
TTW00006068	Sword! Of course! Weapons, my boy! You name it, I've helped someone kill it.
TTW00006069	Let me guess. You belong the Order of the...
TTW00006070	Sword! Of course! Weapons, my girl! You name it, I've helped someone kill it.
TTW00006071	Let me guess. You belong the Order of the...
TTW00006072	What do you Scribes do?
TTW00006073	Indeed I can!
TTW00006074	Pay no heed to those headstrong Knights, with their pop guns and bravado.
TTW00006075	It is the Scribes, the Scribes who make the Brotherhood what it truly is! The brawn is useless without the brain, hmm? He he he.
TTW00006076	Each Order of Scribes is dedicated to a unique field. All equally important. All more important than those dim-witted grunts.
TTW00006077	Can you tell me something about the Scribes?
TTW00006078	I have some questions about the Brotherhood.
TTW00006079	Ah, one of my favorite subjects, of course! What would you like to know?
TTW00006080	Spill it, Amata. How do I get to the exit?
TTW00006081	Lucky for you, I know another way through. There's a secret tunnel that runs from the Overseer's Office to the Vault door!
TTW00006082	Security doesn't even know about it. Nobody except my father -- and me. "One of the Overseer's secrets," he says.
TTW00006083	Lucky for you, I know of another way in.
TTW00006084	There's a secret tunnel that runs from the Overseer's Office to the Vault door!
TTW00006085	Security doesn't even know about it. Nobody except my father -- and me. "One of the Overseer's secrets," he says.
TTW00006086	I may have been a little hasty earlier. I'm ready to hear your plan.
TTW00006087	Not exactly an apology, but probably the best I can expect.
TTW00006088	You'd better listen, because you'll never escape without my help.
TTW00006089	It won't be easy. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from following your dad.
TTW00006090	I was wrong. I'm sorry. I do need your help.
TTW00006091	Was that an actual apology? From you? Wow. You must really be desperate.
TTW00006092	You're right though. You do need my help. You'll never get out of here on your own. You're lucky I'm such a good friend.
TTW00006093	It won't be easy. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from following your dad.
TTW00006094	Sure am. Stopped in to find something to do.
TTW00006095	I hope by "something to do" you mean a job, otherwise you want to talk with Nova.
TTW00006096	I'm looking for someone to make a delivery. Interested?
TTW00006097	We hope you've enjoyed our tour today. If you have any further questions, please take a brochure from our helpful Vault-Tec guides.
TTW00006098	Should the unlikely event arise that the planet is laid to waste, you'll feel happy knowing your family will be safe in a Vault-Tec Vault.
TTW00006099	Concerns about security? Our Eye-On-You Cameras enable the Vault's leader to watch your every move. You'll never be alone again!
TTW00006100	Bored? Don't be! Step into our Entertainotron Room and watch the latest holotapes or perhaps listen to a symphony. Another Vault-Tec innovation!
TTW00006101	The living sections make use of our revolutionary Floorsuck Autocleaner System for those darned messy kids. Never sweep again!
TTW00006102	Being underground got you down? Smile! Our SimuSun Lighting mimics the feeling of being outside with only a fraction of the sunburn potential.
TTW00006103	Sleep in quiet comfort knowing that our impenetrable vault doors can withstand a direct hit by an atomic bomb with only a projected 2% failure rate.
TTW00006104	Triple-S Technology is Vault-Tec's convergence of the three most important parts of apocalyptic endurance: Safety, Survivability and Sanitation!
TTW00006105	Vault-Tec welcomes you to our new line of subterranean vaults featuring our patented Triple-S Technology.
TTW00006106	So, what's your real name?
TTW00006107	Haven't we been through this already?
TTW00006108	No one knows his name?
TTW00006109	Nope. No one knows his name, where he comes from -- nothin'. He's a mean little bastard for sure.
TTW00006110	He'd be a Paladin by now for sure, except that he ain't got no interest in leadin'. Only killin'. I'm just glad he's on our side.
TTW00006111	What's the story with Gallows?
TTW00006112	Oh man, there's something wrong with that boy. Ain't nobody around here that even knows his real name.
TTW00006113	We got a betting pool in the pride, whole pot goes to the first person who can find out his real name.
TTW00006114	Who else is around town?
TTW00006115	I don't talk to most of them. Billy says that I have to be careful, even when people seem nice. And I'm especially not allowed to talk to Mr. Jericho.
TTW00006116	I usually play with Harden most days, when his dad isn't taking him out to learn to shoot or something.
TTW00006117	Billy says that he's going to teach me to shoot one day too!
TTW00006118	There's the Stahls. They run the Brass Lantern. I go there to eat with my dad sometimes. Doc Church runs the clinic.
TTW00006119	The Confessor is a little weird. But him and mother Maya are always nice to me.
TTW00006120	There's also Moriarty, but dad says that I'm not allowed to talk to him.
TTW00006121	What do you think of Megaton?
TTW00006122	It's great! My dad says that one day, I'm gonna get to be sheriff, just like him!
TTW00006123	Who takes care of you?
TTW00006124	How did you meet Billy?
TTW00006125	My dad, of course. He teaches me to shoot, and about the law, and keeping people safe. When he's not busy protecting the town, that is.
TTW00006126	Who takes care of you?
TTW00006127	Later.
TTW00006128	*Sigh* It's one thing after another in this place, isn't it? Anyway, I should get going.
TTW00006129	You know, I thought about moving once. Setting myself up in Rivet City or one of the smaller settlements. But hey, this place is home.
TTW00006130	Hm hmm.
TTW00006131	Megaton needs a stronger defense force. Okay, there's Simms and Steel, and the town militia, but half of us can't even aim straight.
TTW00006132	I was rooting around in Springvale the other day and guess what I found: a book! An actual book! Can you believe it?
TTW00006133	Do you ever question the wisdom in hanging around an atomic bomb all day? I mean, if it was going to blow, it probably would have by now. But still.
TTW00006134	God, that Jericho guy gives me the creeps. He's such a nutjob.
TTW00006135	Did you hear about the Enclave? Nathan said they're really the U.S. government. He says that they're coming to help us.
TTW00006136	Walter sure is a grumpy old bastard. But he keeps that crusty old plant running, so I guess we have no choice but to put up with him.
TTW00006137	I swear to God, Moira's crazy. She sold me this thing the other day, I didn't even know what the hell it was. Damn good saleswoman though. Damn good.
TTW00006138	With Walter dead, we're screwed. No one else can keep that treatment plant running.
TTW00006139	We'll catch up later.
TTW00006140	Hey. How's it going?
TTW00006141	Can't say that there's much going on.
TTW00006142	Nada.
TTW00006143	Not much.
TTW00006144	Nothing. We'll talk later.
TTW00006145	Hello, my child.
TTW00006146	Look, I told you people: I'm busy. Leave me alone.
TTW00006147	Evening.
TTW00006148	Oh! Hi!
TTW00006149	What's up?
TTW00006150	Good evening.
TTW00006151	I'm bored. Let's see if I can lighten things up around here.
TTW00006152	What happened to the other kids from the Pitt?
TTW00006153	All of 'em became Initiates. Most of them went on to become Brothers. A lot fell in action.
TTW00006154	I'm the only survivor of the Scourge of the Pitt still stationed at the Citadel.
TTW00006155	That was before I knew how boring it was.
TTW00006156	Then you don't have to hear it. The hell with you.
TTW00006157	Huh? I'm sorry, are you still talking?
TTW00006158	Hey, you wanted to hear it.
TTW00006159	What made them so terrible?
TTW00006160	The rivers. Even after the war, they were still flowing, but irradiated, and filled with God knows what else.
TTW00006161	What is that stone head?
TTW00006162	That's Lincoln. Hannibal found it. He wants to put it back. I don't really understand why.
TTW00006163	That's Lincoln, ma'am. Hannibal found it. He wants to put it back, ma'am. I don't really understand why.
TTW00006164	That's Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator. We don't know how it came to be here, but it's fitting, don't you think?
TTW00006165	Haven't you been listening? That's Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator.
TTW00006166	God damn rookie. That's Lincoln. He freed some slaves a long time ago.
TTW00006167	If you want to know more, come listen to Hannibal give his speech. He does it right after the noon meal.
TTW00006168	What are a bunch of escaped slaves doing holed up here?
TTW00006169	We are the only hope for runaway slaves everywhere.
TTW00006170	Rivet City, and the Citadel can't be bothered with helping slaves. They turn a blind eye.
TTW00006171	We are the only ones willing to stand against Paradise Falls and slavery.
TTW00006172	Why do you stay here? Why not keep running?
TTW00006173	I solemnly swear to protect the Temple of the Union.
TTW00006174	Welcome, brother, to the Temple of the Union!
TTW00006175	Our home is your home. Your past is your own affair, so long as you serve our common good.
TTW00006176	As a symbol of our trust, here is a key to the gate.
TTW00006177	Welcome, sister, to the Temple of the Union!
TTW00006178	Our home is your home. Your past is your own affair, so long as you serve our common good.
TTW00006179	As a symbol of our trust, here is a key to the gate.
TTW00006180	Quick, close the door!
TTW00006181	Reilly's Rangers, huh? Never heard of you.
TTW00006182	You been stuck living in a vault the last decade or something?
TTW00006183	We're guns for hire; the best merc group in the Capital Wasteland. If you need something done in there, you seek us out.
TTW00006184	I don't cut anyone slack. Deal with it.
TTW00006185	Nice that you pick on bed-ridden people. That how you get your jollies? Does it make you feel tough?
TTW00006186	If you want to hear me out, then shut the hell up. If not, get out of my face.
TTW00006187	Okay, okay. Sorry.
TTW00006188	If time wasn't so precious right now, I wouldn't be so on edge either. I need to get help for the rest of the Rangers, and fast.
TTW00006189	My apologies. I didn't know who you were.
TTW00006190	That's okay, kid. Don't sweat it. The Wasteland's a big place.
TTW00006191	We're guns for hire; the best merc group in the Capital Wasteland. If you need something done in there, you seek us out.
TTW00006192	Whoa, whoa. Calm down! Who are you?
TTW00006193	I'm sorry. The name's Reilly. Yeah, THE Reilly as in Reilly's Rangers.
TTW00006194	So this is the Lincoln Memorial?
TTW00006195	Not for long.
TTW00006196	I can't wait to see the Great Emancipator turn into a smoking pile of rubble.
TTW00006197	It's the Lincoln Memorial. This Lincoln guy supposedly freed all the slaves before the bombs dropped.
TTW00006198	So the pussies built a Memorial to him.
TTW00006199	It's got our slaves thinking that they can be free too.
TTW00006200	What is this place?
TTW00006201	[sobbing]
TTW00006202	Please, sit back, relax and free yourself from the bonds of our planet as we take off for the stars! [bzzzzt!]
TTW00006203	To understand why man is so interested in this unknown expanse of space around our little world, we must take a journey.
TTW00006204	For as long as history has been recorded, man has had an insatiable hunger for knowledge regarding the universe.
TTW00006205	Air feels all fucked up tonight. I think a storm's comin'.
TTW00006206	Dumbass rookies, man.
TTW00006207	That's what I said! After a couple hours, we just put a cap in him to get him to shut up.
TTW00006208	Monsters? They probably got their asses handed to 'em by some Wastelanders and ran home like a bunch of pussies.
TTW00006209	No, but this sounds like it'll be good.
TTW00006210	Yeah, yeah. Keep runnin' your mouth, asshole. Keep fuckin' with me, and I'll be your worst nightmare.
TTW00006211	Coward!
TTW00006212	Get back here, you fucking coward!
TTW00006213	Goddamnit!
TTW00006214	Get back here!
TTW00006215	Hey! Don't leave me alone!
TTW00006216	Where are you going?
TTW00006217	Don't you go runnin!
TTW00006218	You git back here!
TTW00006219	Go on, now!
TTW00006220	I'm just looking for a place to rest, and maybe do some trading.
TTW00006221	Hannibal says I gotta let folks like you in, but that don't mean I have to like it.
TTW00006222	Keep your hands in sight and don't make any sudden moves.
TTW00006223	I'm coming down to open the gate.
TTW00006224	I put a bullet right between Ted Strayer's eyes. <Lie.>
TTW00006225	So, the Ghoul hater got what was coming to him. Good riddance.
TTW00006226	Here's your caps. I'll take that key.
TTW00006227	Excellent! That will be a lesson for all the Ghoul haters out there.
TTW00006228	Here's you payment for the key.
TTW00006229	Dukov is dead. I blew his brains out. <Lie>
TTW00006230	Serves him right. He won't be spreading lies about Ghouls any more.
TTW00006231	I'll take that key, and here are your caps.
TTW00006232	Dave's head popped like a zit. <Lie>
TTW00006233	Have you got what I want?
TTW00006234	Marvelous! My list is growing shorter.
TTW00006235	Here's Strayer's key. Shot in the head, just like you asked.
TTW00006236	That wasn't the plan. I suppose I have to pay for the key anyway though. Here.
TTW00006237	Here's Strayer's key. But I'm afraid he's still alive.
TTW00006238	So long as I get that key, I don't care.
TTW00006239	Here's your caps.
TTW00006240	Here's Strayer's key. But I'm afraid he's still alive.
TTW00006241	May his soul rot! This is great news.
TTW00006242	I'll take that key as a memento. Here, take your caps.
TTW00006243	Dukov is dead, with a head shot, and here's his key.
TTW00006244	I thought I told you to kill him? That rat bastard is still alive!
TTW00006245	I'll pay for the key, but you really screwed up!
TTW00006246	Here's Dukov's key. I got it without killing him.
TTW00006247	Who cares? I've got his key. That's all I really want.
TTW00006248	Here's Dukov's key. I got it without killing him.
TTW00006249	I'll pay you for the key, but I'm very disappointed.
TTW00006250	Here's Dave's key, but he's not dead.
TTW00006251	Here's Dave's key, but he's not dead.
TTW00006252	It's a deal.
TTW00006253	We will enshrine this right away.
TTW00006254	I know! No one understands me either!
TTW00006255	God! It's so nice to have someone who understands! I mean, sure, when I left Little Lamplight, I was happy to be out of there.
TTW00006256	I was dating Pappy then, you know. I got here and he was like "Big Town will be safe", but it wasn't! This place is always under attack!
TTW00006257	But I don't date liars, so I dumped his ass and got with Flash. But that didn't last very long. Me and Timebomb were a thing for a while, too.
TTW00006258	Finally! Someone who doesn't judge me! You know, the people here are just so quick to assume that they know everything about you.
TTW00006259	I mean, like, just because I look different doesn't mean that I'm some sort of freak, you know? It's like, hello, this world sucks!
TTW00006260	No one gets that, they're all like "blah blah blah blah blah, what's wrong with that girl?".
TTW00006261	Nice to meet you, Bittercup.
TTW00006262	Finally! Someone who doesn't judge me! You know, the people here are just so quick to assume that they know everything about you.
TTW00006263	I mean, like, just because I'm different doesn't mean that I'm some sort of freak, you know? It's like, hello, this world sucks!
TTW00006264	No one gets that, they're all like "blah blah blah blah blah, what's wrong with that girl?".
TTW00006265	La-la-la-la-laaaaa! YOU shut up!
TTW00006266	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
TTW00006267	And one day a giant ant came up to him and started talking like he wasn't some dumb ant, but a person of some kind! It said, "Prepare to die!"
TTW00006268	The End!
TTW00006269	MS01StickyHandsEscort
TTW00006270	<whistling tunelessly>
TTW00006271	Shhh!
TTW00006272	I'll wait over here for you. When you're done playing with the children we'll go to Big Town.
TTW00006273	Take me to Big Town and you'll get your reward. My girlfriend Red has lots of caps.
TTW00006274	I'll wait for you outside, unless you want to go now?
TTW00006275	You got any caps? I'll escort you to Big Town, but it'll cost you.
TTW00006276	I'm not allowed in Little Lamplight anymore.
TTW00006277	Only people under 18 get to live in Little Lamplight.
TTW00006278	So, when your done with those little kids, we can go to Big Town together! I'll wait outside for you.
TTW00006279	Fine. I'll take you to Big Town. But first I need to visit Little Lamplight.
TTW00006280	Hey you. Yeah you! Don't bother with the children at Little Lamplight. Let's go to Big Town instead!
TTW00006281	Hostilities will not be tolerated.
TTW00006282	Please do not disturb the other residents. Take your seat.
TTW00006283	Please take a seat in the nearest available Tranquility Lounger. Thank you for your cooperation.
TTW00006284	Mommy? Mommy?! No! [crying]
TTW00006285	Daddy? Daddy?! No! [crying]
TTW00006286	Good morning? What the hell is wrong with you?
TTW00006287	What a good morning!
TTW00006288	Come again, come again. Any truckers on this wave?
TTW00006289	I read you, buddy. Y'all see those clouds? Over.
TTW00006290	10-4, it's the commies. Let's circle the wagons, meet us at the state line on Route Seven.
TTW00006291	Indeed. A man's word is worth his weight in caps. I suppose I could arrange for a bonus of say, 500 caps in addition to the base fee.
TTW00006292	When it's done, meet me at Tenpenny Tower. It's southwest of here, well out of harm's way. You can't miss it. Any questions?
TTW00006293	Have you thought about disarming the bomb?
TTW00006294	Oh, I couldn’t do that! It’d be a real blow to those nice folks in the Church.
TTW00006295	Besides, it’s not like that bomb ever hurt anyone. Live and let live, right?
TTW00006296	Righto. And be quick about it! I haven't been dry in years. I'd hate to start now.
TTW00006297	You freak! You're going to eat me, aren't you?
TTW00006298	Grrr! Hungry!
TTW00006299	There's plenty of body parts laying around, why don't you eat those instead?
TTW00006300	Not fresh! Not warm! Taste old.
TTW00006301	I hope you choke on my bones!
TTW00006302	Hahaha! Not your tiny bones, little man! Grrrraaaahhhh!
TTW00006303	Who you calling little?!
TTW00006304	Shut up now! Grraaaah!
TTW00006305	Oh God. Kill me quickly, I beg you!
TTW00006306	Grrr! Hahaha! Graaah!
TTW00006307	Come on. Follow me.
TTW00006308	We'll be right behind you.
TTW00006309	You and Shorty, follow me.
TTW00006310	We'll stick with you, don't worry!
TTW00006311	You and Red, follow me.
TTW00006312	I'll just hope you know what you're doing.
TTW00006313	I'm right behind you!
TTW00006314	Right! Let's go!
TTW00006315	There it is! We're almost there! Come on! Yiiipppiiieee!
TTW00006316	What's in it for me if I risk my neck for you?
TTW00006317	Spoken like a merc. You sound like me when I was just a kid starting out in the business.
TTW00006318	Okay hotshot, how about a full suit of Ranger Armor? It's the best combat armor in the Wasteland.
TTW00006319	Or if that doesn't do it for you I'll set you up with a minigun from our armory. Either way, you walk away with something.
TTW00006320	I don't know, Reilly. This sounds like suicide.
TTW00006321	Look, I don't know where else to go. In the shape I'm in, I'll be lucky to get ten feet.
TTW00006322	I'll sweeten the deal for you, maybe it'll help. How about I set you up with a suit of Ranger Armor if you get them back?
TTW00006323	If that doesn't do it for you I'll set you up with a minigun from our armory. Either way, you walk away with something.
TTW00006324	So that leaves them up there. How come you're here?
TTW00006325	My bad idea I'm afraid. I had a Stealth Boy which allowed me to slip off the roof unnoticed. The plan was to get back to get some help.
TTW00006326	I was almost at the street when a Super Mutant jumped me. Damn near ripped my arm off in the process.
TTW00006327	Last thing I remember was falling into a culvert. Now I'm here. Some rescue attempt, huh?
TTW00006328	What did you need from me?
TTW00006329	Get the Rangers home. Please. That's all I want. I don't care how you do it.
TTW00006330	Look, I could care less about your stories.
TTW00006331	Fine. Since you're all business and obviously don't give a damn about human life, I got a proposal for you.
TTW00006332	You want to hear it, or you gonna keep flapping your lips?
TTW00006333	Last stand?
TTW00006334	Last stand? Well, we hoped not. We figured we'd get up there and get a better signal to radio the Brotherhood of Steel for help.
TTW00006335	Problem is, help never arrived. Vernon Square is so thick with the Super Mutants, I don't think they could slip through.
TTW00006336	Trapped yourself at the top of a tall building. Brilliant.
TTW00006337	Look, I don't know what your problem is, but I got three guys alone out there with an army of Super Mutants around them.
TTW00006338	Either help me by listening, or get the hell out of my sight. I'm not here to be judged by you or anyone else.
TTW00006339	Now, like I was saying, we had to fight our way up towards the roof of the Statesman.
TTW00006340	Bad move, I'm guessing.
TTW00006341	Very bad move, but we had no choice.
TTW00006342	On the way we lost Theo, one of my guys. We were unable to get the ammo case off of his body as we were pushed onwards.
TTW00006343	So, guns almost dry, we hit the roof of the Statesman.
TTW00006344	Tell me the whole story.
TTW00006345	Do you mind if I try and revive her?
TTW00006346	Unless you're an expert at medicine, I wouldn't recommend it. You may end up doing more harm than good.
TTW00006347	However, I'm all for helping my patients, so if you think you have the ability, be my guest.
TTW00006348	Do you think there's any way to revive her?
TTW00006349	Well, I wouldn't recommend it. She's in some sort of coma. It's dangerous to force someone out of one.
TTW00006350	There's no telling when she'll come out of it I'm afraid.
TTW00006351	How did she end up in the Chop Shop?
TTW00006352	She was just brought in by a few others. They found her bleeding to death at the entrance to the city here.
TTW00006353	If she'd been out in the tunnels any longer, she'd have been someone's meal by now.
TTW00006354	What's wrong with her?
TTW00006355	She had multiple lacerations, contusions, broken leg, some internal bleeding and blunt force trauma.
TTW00006356	She hasn't been conscious since they brought her in a few days ago.
TTW00006357	I'd say she tangled with some Super Mutants and lost. It's a miracle she isn't dead.
TTW00006358	Reilly's Rangers?
TTW00006359	Oh, you must be new around here.
TTW00006360	They're a mercenary company that bases itself out of the D.C. Ruins. I'm assuming she's their leader, Reilly.
TTW00006361	What was left of her armor had her name stenciled on it. She was in a pretty bad way when they found her outside Underworld.
TTW00006362	Yeah, she's fine. They patched her up and she's resting in Underworld.
TTW00006363	That's a relief. I told her she was nuts when she decided to try to sneak out of here. Guess I was wrong. Now, let's talk about getting out of here.
TTW00006364	I would have proposed going back the way you came, but apparently it's impossible now.
TTW00006365	So, the express elevator is our only solution.
TTW00006366	No time for chatter. I'm here to get you guys out.
TTW00006367	Hang on there. First, I need to know if Reilly is okay. I assume she made it somewhere if you're here.
TTW00006368	Hang on there. First, I need to know if Reilly is okay. I assume she made it somewhere if you're here.
TTW00006369	I'm afraid this is it.
TTW00006370	Just you? You made it up here alone?
TTW00006371	Hmmm, and you made it all the way up here alive?
TTW00006372	How do I know they're still alive?
TTW00006373	Before I left I gave them an order to keep broadcasting for help over their radio.
TTW00006374	Hopefully, when you get near their location, you'll pick it up.
TTW00006375	Can you think of anything that will help me get there?
TTW00006376	We have a headquarters not far from here.
TTW00006377	If you can make it there, you are welcome to anything you need inside. Just punch in Reilly0247 at the gate.
TTW00006378	We have ammo, supplies, you name it.
TTW00006379	What can you tell me about Vernon Square?
TTW00006380	If I wasn't asking for your help, I'd tell you to stay away. It's thick with Super Mutants. I don't know why.
TTW00006381	Butcher, our team medic, has always suspected something's in the area they are looking for or being attracted to.
TTW00006382	The only place worse I can think of is the Mall.
TTW00006383	There's something about this area. I can't put my finger on it, but just like the Mall, there's an unusually high concentration of Super Mutants.
TTW00006384	If I had the time and resources, I'd investigate. All I care about now is getting the hell off this damn roof.
TTW00006385	I don't think I need to hear any more.
TTW00006386	Good. I'm getting tired of flapping jaw with you, clown shoes.
TTW00006387	I think I'll flap my balls against Cherry's ass instead! Oh, yeah!
TTW00006388	Actually, Crowley is alive. He wants some sort of security key you have.
TTW00006389	So the meatbag is alive, huh? Fine with me. Just show me the money. Put your fucking caps on the table and you can have it.
TTW00006390	Fine with me. Just show me the money. Put your fucking caps on the table and you can have it.
TTW00006391	He wants some sort of security key you have.
TTW00006392	So the meatbag is alive, huh? And I bet I know what he wants.
TTW00006393	But I don't know what you want. What's your angle, clown shoes?
TTW00006394	Actually, Crowley is alive. I'm supposed to kill you and bring him proof.
TTW00006395	Crowley is alive, and he paid me to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
TTW00006396	I've got nothing against Ghouls. Ha! I even had a Ghoul party girl once, to see what it was like!
TTW00006397	This is about the key, isn't it? The goddamn key. If you want it, I'd better see some fucking caps on the table, clown shoes.
TTW00006398	Give me that key. I'd hate to see you bleed to death.
TTW00006399	Mister Crowley wants your father's security key.
TTW00006400	Whoa! Is it, like, worth caps? Cause I got needs, man.
TTW00006401	Whoa! Is this, like, worth caps? Cause I got needs, man.
TTW00006402	I'm guessing Crowley wants your father's key. Just a hunch.
TTW00006403	Whoa! Is this, like, worth caps? Cause I got needs, man.
TTW00006404	If you give me something personal of yours as proof, I'll lie to Crowley.
TTW00006405	Sounds like a normal guy.
TTW00006406	You're too nosy for your own good. It can be a dangerous habit.
TTW00006407	Sorry. Just forget it.
TTW00006408	I don't give away anything for free. Besides, it's obviously worth something to you.
TTW00006409	Why should I have to pay for gossip?
TTW00006410	A whole bottle? You got a deal. All I know is that he keeps trying to hire outsiders to do some killing.
TTW00006411	I heard him mumble something about a Fort too.
TTW00006412	How about a whole bottle? Here's 10 caps.
TTW00006413	Very funny.
TTW00006414	Crowley has some scam going where he's going to get rich.
TTW00006415	He tried to get me to kill these three guys, but I wouldn't do it. I've met Dave, and he's no more of a Ghoul bigot than I am.
TTW00006416	Come on. You can tell me. Ahzrukhal said so. <Lie.>
TTW00006417	Oh, well that's different.
TTW00006418	You're the third human he's tried to get to kill those guys.
TTW00006419	He won't ask me, or anyone else in Underworld. It's kind of weird.
TTW00006420	Deal. All I know is that he keeps trying to hire outsiders to do some killing.
TTW00006421	Here's 3 caps for a drink, but you've got to tell me what you know.
TTW00006422	Ooh, a big spender.
TTW00006423	Well, it's better than nothing. Crowley has been outfitting himself for some big expedition.
TTW00006424	He's up to something, but he isn't saying what.
TTW00006425	What can you tell me about Mister Crowley?
TTW00006426	Whoa! That's a blast from the past.
TTW00006427	My dad knew a dude named Crowley. I never met him though.
TTW00006428	I think Dad said he died when they were checking out some old fort.
TTW00006429	Do you know a Mister Crowley?
TTW00006430	The Ghoul? He's dead. Died twenty years ago.
TTW00006431	Good riddance too. I hate those shufflers.
TTW00006432	Do you remember a Mister Crowley?
TTW00006433	Hey, that's your loss, smoothskin.
TTW00006434	I don't think so.
TTW00006435	Okay. What's the plan?
TTW00006436	Not everyone is as sympathetic to Ghouls as you are. In fact some humans are downright bigots.
TTW00006437	They treat us like zombies, calling us brain eaters and shufflers.
TTW00006438	Easy now. I've got nothing against Ghouls.
TTW00006439	Is that so? Even if I call you a milk-sucking, mutant-loving, water-stealing whore?
TTW00006440	Is that so? Even if I call you a milk-sucking, mutant-loving, water-stealing son of a whore?
TTW00006441	Do you have any traders in town? Any doctors?
TTW00006442	Well, you've seen the clinic. Red's the smart one in Big Town. I'd ask her.
TTW00006443	This place looks like a ghost town.
TTW00006444	Nah, no way. Big Town is a great place to be! I bet I could live over there, in that building with all the bullet holes and burn marks. Cool!
TTW00006445	Just ask everyone else in town. I'm sure they'll tell you how great it is to be here, all grownup!
TTW00006446	What do you think will happen to Big Town?
TTW00006447	Where did you people come from, anyway?
TTW00006448	Oh, Little Lamplight is where most of us came from. Red and Pappy and Flash and Bittercup. We used to play together, when we were kids.
TTW00006449	Then we got old, and we had to leave. Those were the rules. So we packed up and headed here, like we were supposed to.
TTW00006450	We all used to live in a place called Little Lamplight, but they have a rule about age. You reach sixteen, and you're out.
TTW00006451	Didn't matter, though, because you'd just pack your things and head to Big Town. All the adults go there, and there's plenty to eat.
TTW00006452	"Plenty to eat" alright, if you like eating bullets. I've lost count of how many times I've been shot at.
TTW00006453	Big Town? A fairy-tale really. The Lamplighters who turn sixteen aren't allowed to stay in the caves, but they have to go somewhere.
TTW00006454	And to encourage people to leave, they invented Big Town: the "great grownup place" that you got to go to when you became an adult.
TTW00006455	I think you can see how true those stories were.
TTW00006456	Give me the history of this place.
TTW00006457	From the look of things, I'd say a Super Mutant sat down in a ditch one day and shat out this town.
TTW00006458	I dragged myself here from Lamplight. I didn't believe all the stories about Big Town, but I wasn't about to let everyone else go there without me.
TTW00006459	A few dozen attacks on the town later, and here I am. Almost an ingredient in a Super Mutant chilli cook-off.
TTW00006460	Do you know how Big Town got started?
TTW00006461	I have a Fission Battery that will fix that express elevator.
TTW00006462	Well, what the fuck you bringin' it to me for? Give to Donovan. Sheesh.
TTW00006463	Are there any other ways off this roof?
TTW00006464	Well, I can think of a faster way, but I doubt you'd survive the fall.
TTW00006465	Seriously, the elevator is our only chance now that the radio tower is gone.
TTW00006466	We'll chat about stuff later. We have to get out of here, right now!
TTW00006467	Listen. I don't know who you are. I don't even know why Reilly sent you. One thing I do know is that you're beginning to piss me off.
TTW00006468	Now, stop being an asshole and work with me, will ya?
TTW00006469	Who put you in charge?
TTW00006470	Reilly did. I'm the second in command of the Rangers. Now, can you just answer the question?
TTW00006471	Any clue where I can find a Fission Battery?
TTW00006472	Hmmmm. Not really. All I remember is passing that maintenance office on the third floor.
TTW00006473	Sorry, we were under fire the whole time. Otherwise, I would have cleaned the place out.
TTW00006474	When we passed the maintenance room, I spied a deactivated Protectron inside. Just wrench open its access panel and you'll find it.
TTW00006475	All I remember is mowing down Super Mutants with Eugene here.
TTW00006476	Who are those girls? And where are their clothes?
TTW00006477	Ha ha! They're my party girls.
TTW00006478	I'm too much man for just one woman, so I need two! I wear them out every night.
TTW00006479	Why should they bother getting dressed when I'm just going to take it off?
TTW00006480	Ha ha! Cherry is my play toy.
TTW00006481	I love my Cherry pie! Love it all night long!
TTW00006482	I like her half naked. I like her all naked, but she says she gets cold.
TTW00006483	Who's that girl? And why isn't she dressed?
TTW00006484	She makes all my fantasies come true. Ha ha!
TTW00006485	That's my favorite outfit. If she gets cold, old Dukov knows how to warm her up!
TTW00006486	That girl looks cold. Why isn't she dressed?
TTW00006487	Hey! Watch your language, clown shoes.
TTW00006488	I don't pay them. They take care of me, so I take care of them. We rub each other wrong all night long! Ha, ha!
TTW00006489	Hey! Watch your language, clown shoes.
TTW00006490	I take care of her, so she takes care of me. Ha, ha! She rubs me wrong all night long. Ha, ha!
TTW00006491	"Old Lady Dithers"? I thought you were the one who said we should be nice, and refer to her as "Ms. Dithers".
TTW00006492	George, honestly. You know I don't like talking to her.
TTW00006493	Oh, Mabel. Did you want to look for a new robot? I know you're not comfortable with yours.
TTW00006494	Why, hello there.
TTW00006495	How are you today?
TTW00006496	Mister Crowley is alive. I'm here to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
TTW00006497	He's alive? I should have known. It's hard to kill those zombies. You gotta shoot 'em in the head.
TTW00006498	Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it.
TTW00006499	Those people you sent me to kill aren't Ghoul haters...
TTW00006500	Your Republic is forfeit. Prepare to be reclaimed by the Wasteland!
TTW00006501	Let's see what the Army of Dave has to say about that, invader!
TTW00006502	Daddy Dave! Help us! Please!
TTW00006503	Get Daddy Dave! Invader! Invader!
TTW00006504	Communist! She's a Communist! Everyone come quick!
TTW00006505	Communist! He's a Communist! Everyone come quick!
TTW00006506	Dave! Dave!
TTW00006507	Someone help! Invader! Invader!
TTW00006508	I'm not here to hurt anyone. What is this place?
TTW00006509	We're the Republic of Dave. Or we used to be anyway. You have to go now. Dave isn't here anymore to talk to you.
TTW00006510	A gift of the key would be a strategic diplomatic move, Mister President.
TTW00006511	Hmm. Of course it would. I knew that. I was just testing you to see if you would realize it.
TTW00006512	Here, take the key. It is a gift from the Republic of Dave to the Wasteland.
TTW00006513	Hmm. Of course it would. I knew that. I was just testing you to see if you would realize it.
TTW00006514	Here, take this key. It is a gift from the Republic of Dave to the Wasteland.
TTW00006515	A gift would be a strategic diplomatic move, Mr. President. Something personal.
TTW00006516	Mister Crowley is alive. He sent me to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
TTW00006517	Me? Hate Ghouls? Preposterous.
TTW00006518	Wait. You said you're here to kill me? I'm going to have to recind your diplomatic immunity.
TTW00006519	Then I'm going to execute you.
TTW00006520	Wait. I've changed my mind. You have one hour to leave the Republic. Then I'll execute you.
TTW00006521	Crowley is alive, Mister President. I'm supposed to bring him the key.
TTW00006522	Alive? I always wondered. He was locked in with a bunch of Feral Ghouls. They won't attack Ghouls, you see.
TTW00006523	The key is part of the Republic of Dave treasury. I couldn't possibly part with it.
TTW00006524	Alive? I always wondered. He was locked in with a bunch of Feral Ghouls. They won't attack Ghouls, you see.
TTW00006525	Would you consider taking him a personal item, like this key, and just telling him you killed me?
TTW00006526	Crowley is alive, Mr. President. I'm supposed to bring back proof of your death.
TTW00006527	I seek citizenship in the Republic of Dave.
TTW00006528	First off, you will address me as Mister President. Always. No exceptions.
TTW00006529	Secondly, after careful consideration, the Office of Immigrant Affairs reports that we've already exceeded our quota for immigration this year.
TTW00006530	Application denied. You have 24 hours to leave the Republic, or face deportation.
TTW00006531	I'm sorry we lost Butcher and Donovan.
TTW00006532	I'm sorry we lost Brick and Donovan.
TTW00006533	You're a goddamn liar. You told me we were going to Rivet City but we've been out here for over five days! I've had it. I'm going back.
TTW00006534	Rivet City it is.
TTW00006535	Let me pack my bags. Oh, wait, I don't have any. Let's get out of here.
TTW00006536	If he's that bad, come with me. I'll protect you.
TTW00006537	Only if you take me to Rivet City.
TTW00006538	Anywhere else and I'll just end up being someone else's property.
TTW00006539	You should come with me. You can't survive here by yourself.
TTW00006540	Okay. Rivet City has got to be better than this.
TTW00006541	I have my hands in his pants all the time. He probably won't even notice it's gone.
TTW00006542	Dukov has a special key. Get it for me and I'll take you to Rivet City.
TTW00006543	Thanks for the warning.
TTW00006544	Right. Because I've got all kinds of survival skills.
TTW00006545	I've only got one skill, and it won't do me any fucking good here.
TTW00006546	Go on. Get out of here.
TTW00006547	I'm sure you can find a way to survive here.
TTW00006548	No sweat.
TTW00006549	Does he pay you for this?
TTW00006550	Of course. Why else would I stay with the old fart? You don't think I actually love that bastard, do you?
TTW00006551	He gives me some caps, but it's not what you think. He can be a nice guy.
TTW00006552	And when the lights go out, he's real fun!
TTW00006553	Why aren't you dressed?
TTW00006554	Dukov likes to keep it hot. Ain't no need for nothin' else.
TTW00006555	Dukov liked to keep it hot. He always said there ain't no need for nothin' else.
TTW00006556	Dukey didn't like me to wear a lot. He said it slowed things down.
TTW00006557	Who are you? And why are you dressed like that?
TTW00006558	So what's the deal with Dukov?
TTW00006559	He's a lecherous old man. The only reason I put up with him and his "needs" is because I'm safe here.
TTW00006560	He tends to shoot first and ask questions later. Don't pull out a weapon near him. He's likely to shoot you.
TTW00006561	And he's really good.
TTW00006562	That's horrible! You're horrible! This thing is horrible! Everything's horrible! Argh!
TTW00006563	With that much testing, I guess it's beyond correction. Oh, go ahead and keep it. Maybe you can find a nicer use for it. But I doubt it.
TTW00006564	It's like explosive whack-a-Mole Rat. Can I get it in bullet form? For people?
TTW00006565	The last chapter's a bit more esoteric. It's about the survival of humanity as a whole, and how to rebuild society. Deep stuff, huh?
TTW00006566	We need to know how large settlements are formed, how to harness the old technology, and I'll need you to get ancient history from a nearby library.
TTW00006567	We're in the last stretch, now, so let's finish it up strong! What's first?
TTW00006568	I'm ready to start researching the last chapter.
TTW00006569	The second chapter's going to be a bit trickier, I think. It'll cover how to handle creatures out there, for better or for worse.
TTW00006570	For example, repelling Mole Rats, learning about Mirelurks, and when all else fails, how to handle being injured.
TTW00006571	So, let's buckle down and get to work on this chapter. What's first?
TTW00006572	I'm ready to start researching the next chapter.
TTW00006573	Now then, a trader gave me this bit of electronics from the RobCo factory. It ought to go into some mainframe in there to control the robots.
TTW00006574	If there's a way to reactivate and control the robots there, it'd make for a good example of harnessing the past's technology for the book!
TTW00006575	Mirelurks are a big threat in some areas, and knowing more about them can help people learn to avoid, or even outsmart them.
TTW00006576	So I picked up this observer device to study them in their natural habitat. I need you to hide one in one of the spawning pods in their lairs.
TTW00006577	What's this about studying Mirelurks?
TTW00006578	Oh, this is so exciting! I feel like I'm sending you out on some sort of super-assignment!
TTW00006579	Supposedly, if you connect it to the mainframe at the RobCo factory, you get access to an army of robots!
TTW00006580	Seems like it's right up your alley, huh? And it'd be a great example of how to harness technology, wouldn't it?
TTW00006581	Guards!
TTW00006582	There's no need to flex. I was just playing with you. We know who you are. You can come in.
TTW00006583	Oh, and, if you want, I have a mutually beneficial offer for you to think about.
TTW00006584	Do you know who you're dealing with? Let me in. Now!
TTW00006585	Relax. I was just playing with you. We know who you are. You can come in.
TTW00006586	Oh, and, if you want, I have a mutually beneficial offer for you to think about.
TTW00006587	Your pals over at the Lincoln Memorial seemed pretty happy with me.
TTW00006588	I was just kidding. You're a slave. Deal with it.
TTW00006589	Damn you.
TTW00006590	You're a slave. Deal with it.
TTW00006591	I swear, if I ever get out of this mess, you're dead.
TTW00006592	Whatever.
TTW00006593	I can try getting that collar off. But it might explode if I tinker with it.
TTW00006594	I'd rather be dead than a slave. Do it!
TTW00006595	Amata, please. Don't be stubborn. I only want to talk to your friend. Surely you understand what's at stake here.
TTW00006596	Please stop. Please don't have him hit me again. Don't you care that I'm your own daughter?
TTW00006597	I've always indulged you, Amata. And now you've taken advantage of my lenience.
TTW00006598	Go ahead, Officer.
TTW00006599	You need to learn some respect.
TTW00006600	Please, Daddy, no!
TTW00006601	All right, officer. Let me try again.
TTW00006602	That's not how it was supposed to work at all! The poor little Mole Ratties with their little noses! That's just horrible!
TTW00006603	I guess it's back to the drawing board for that repellent. I wonder if I can make it into some sort of fuel. Anyway, I'll just take that.
TTW00006604	I don't think it works like you hoped. The Mole Rats all died.
TTW00006605	It certainly is. With that last bit of info, I'm all done!
TTW00006606	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
TTW00006607	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
TTW00006608	Is that it for the last chapter?
TTW00006609	Yes, that concludes our exceptional expert endeavor! I have to admit, I was worried it would go over some peoples' heads, but it should be fine.
TTW00006610	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
TTW00006611	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
TTW00006612	And now my research for your book is completed. Isn't it?
TTW00006613	Yup, that's the last bit for the toughest survival guide in the Wastes! Survivors of the world, rejoice! And everyone else, too!
TTW00006614	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
TTW00006615	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
TTW00006616	Are we done with the last chapter?
TTW00006617	Smooth, suave, and done with a smile. I swear I picked up a few pointers from your style, myself!
TTW00006618	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
TTW00006619	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
TTW00006620	Correct me if I'm wrong, but that completes the book. Right?
TTW00006621	Oh, you. Of course we are. And I think I'm really capturing that snide wit of yours. So, for all your snippiness, I think it'll help with the book.
TTW00006622	Still, I can put up with plenty of your little jabs, as long as the research is good.
TTW00006623	And, yes, you'll still get paid. Here: nothing says loving like big boxes of ammunition, right? Now, on to the next chapter?
TTW00006624	This chapter done yet? I don't know how much more research I can take.
TTW00006625	Well, lucky for you, we're done! And for all your nasty attitude, I think the quips made it a lot more entertaining to read. That's bound to help.
TTW00006626	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
TTW00006627	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
TTW00006628	I swear, if I have to research anything else, I'll just shoot myself now.
TTW00006629	I got you the slave you wanted. I can get into Paradise Falls now, right?
TTW00006630	Yeah. Yeah. Go on up, hotshot. Just don't screw around, or things will get ugly. No second chances. Got it?
TTW00006631	Everyone get ready!
TTW00006632	I've found some Holotags.
TTW00006633	Have you? It saddens me to hear of my fallen brethren, but their names and deeds shall be records. Tell me, how many have you found?
TTW00006634	I can't believe I'm being called a potty mouth by a cannibal...
TTW00006635	Okay, that's it. I warned you. Normally, I wouldn't hit a lady, but you're over the line, missy.
TTW00006636	Wait... are you saying you eat those people?
TTW00006637	I don't think I like your tone. There's nothing wrong with me, we've lived this way for decades.
TTW00006638	After the war, four families survived. They continued on just like we have. But when their shelters ran out of food, they need to eat something.
TTW00006639	Family is everything, my friend. I wouldn't expect a wasteland wanderer like you to understand.
TTW00006640	Now, let's just forget that this happened and we'll have no problem, right?
TTW00006641	Yes, I was in the basement.
TTW00006642	Yes. I was in the shed.
TTW00006643	Yes, and I saw what you're hiding down there, you sick bastard!
TTW00006644	"Judge not, lest ye be judged" as the good book says. Honestly, how many people have you killed?
TTW00006645	The only difference between us is that I'm bringing home the bacon for my family.
TTW00006646	Yes, and I saw what you're hiding in there, you sick bastard!
TTW00006647	"Judge not, lest ye be judged" as the good book says. Honestly, how many people have you killed?
TTW00006648	The only difference between us is that I'm bringing home the bacon for my family.
TTW00006649	Tell me about Andale.
TTW00006650	Why, it's a place to settle down and raise a family. Of course, we don't just let anyone in here. The home owners association is very clear on that.
TTW00006651	Besides, there's no room! As amazing as Andale is, is it any wonder that all the houses would be full of happy families?
TTW00006652	Andale: greatest place there is. We win town of the year every year, we've got no end of food, and no troubles at all.
TTW00006653	Yep, there's no better place to raise a family.
TTW00006654	Tell me about this place.
TTW00006655	He keeps saying stuff to my mom about keeping the family going, and how when him and Mr. Wilson were brothers, they didn't want to get married.
TTW00006656	You shut up! Just shut up and listen, okay?
TTW00006657	Listen, you're about the only person who ever had the sense to get out of this place.
TTW00006658	I tell you, your old man had the right idea. I can't stand it down here anymore. You gotta help me get out.
TTW00006659	Oh look, Butch is begging for my help. How'd that work out for you last time?
TTW00006660	Zombies couldn't make a place like Underworld.
TTW00006661	See? I knew you understood Ghouls.
TTW00006662	Old Man Harris doesn't seen very happy.
TTW00006663	No, I mean, really close.
TTW00006664	Oh, someone spilled our beans, didn't they? Well, Andale has been four families and only four families for a very long time.
TTW00006665	Two families marry into one another, take a new name, and start a new life. There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
TTW00006666	Oh, someone spilled our beans, didn't they? Well, Andale has been four families and only four families for a very long time.
TTW00006667	Two families marry into one another, take a new name, and start a new life. There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
TTW00006668	I guess there are worse things.
TTW00006669	I'm from an underground Vault, lady. Trust me, this place sucks.
TTW00006670	Well... I never! The nerve of some people! At least some of us know how to take the high road.
TTW00006671	Did you want something, Mr. Fancy Underground Vault, or did you just come here to turn your nose up at us?
TTW00006672	Well... I never! The nerve of some people! At least some of us know how to take the high road.
TTW00006673	Did you want something, Miss Fancy Underground Vault, or did you just come here to turn your nose up at us?
TTW00006674	Just about everyone in the wasteland knows to avoid Andale, and they're right to do it. People wander in here, and they don't wander back out.
TTW00006675	Well, I haven't talked to anyone here but you. Are they friendly?
TTW00006676	I don't know, it seems like a pretty nice place to me.
TTW00006677	Well, they're not! They're killers! Every one of 'em! Run! Get out while you can!
TTW00006678	Don't believe me, do you? Just check out the basement, or that shed! There's a reason they're locked!
TTW00006679	This dump? Are you serious?
TTW00006680	Well, now. I'm sure that your home town is just so much better than our little Andale.
TTW00006681	Suit yourself, but you don't know what you're missing.
TTW00006682	Linda's meatloaf is the best in the country. And her mince meat pie has won first prize at the town fair three years running.
TTW00006683	But the invitation still stands, if you ever change your mind. But listen to me go on, did you need something else?
TTW00006684	Well, it's good to meet you, Jack.
TTW00006685	And it's good to meet you too! Feel free to stay in Andale as long as you'd like. Heck, stop by the house for dinner sometime if you like.
TTW00006686	Just let Linda know beforehand, so that she can make enough for four!
TTW00006687	What's been happening since you've been back?
TTW00006688	I don't know. I'm not sure I'm cut out for this kind of job anymore.
TTW00006689	I almost got everyone killed in Vernon Square. What kind of a responsible leader does that? It was one bad decision after another.
TTW00006690	Yeah, I think I'm hurt.
TTW00006691	That's funny, you look fine to me. Maybe you should just get some rest.
TTW00006692	Yeah, you look like you need some work.
TTW00006693	All right, hang in there. Let me see what I can do for you.
TTW00006694	Your friends will have to rescue themselves. I'm not going to.
TTW00006695	You going to rescue them, or what?
TTW00006696	Do you know where these Super Mutants took their victims?
TTW00006697	What do you know about these Super Mutants?
TTW00006698	Have you changed your mind? Are you going to rescue our friends? I'd given up hope. It's so hard here in the Wasteland. Not like when we were young.
TTW00006699	He's making a move! Stop him!
TTW00006700	She's making a move! Stop her!
TTW00006701	I've never met a talking tree before.
TTW00006702	Neither have I. Well, I mean I talk to Herbert, but he never really says anything back. Do ya Herbert?
TTW00006703	He kept growing around me, maybe for calling him Herbert all the time. His name's really Bob. I think it's funny when I call him Herbert though.
TTW00006704	I'll share these with the traders, and soon, everyone will know about the Wasteland Survival Guide!
TTW00006705	I should hope so. I nearly killed myself a half dozen times for that thing.
TTW00006706	I'll share these with the traders, and soon, everyone will know about the Wasteland Survival Guide!
TTW00006707	It certainly was an epic piece of work. So, is the final product worth it?
TTW00006708	She did? Well, suppose I've picked up a lot over the years. I mean, no one's spent more time tinkering on this old girl than I have!
TTW00006709	Anyway, you might find some clues in Pinkerton's place, in the broken-off bow. He was around before me, and used to store stuff there before he left.
TTW00006710	Vera spoke very highly of you. She says you know all about this place.
TTW00006711	Hah! Sounds like you've been poking around, all right. I'm surprised any of those reprobates even remember me.
TTW00006712	Maybe they still laugh about how they edged me out of the council, back then. But you can set the record straight!
TTW00006713	I hear you're the only one who knows the truth about Rivet City's founding.
TTW00006714	Well, yes, but it was hardly any place of importance until I arrived on the scene. That's all ancient history now. No one would ever care about it.
TTW00006715	If you insist on wasting your time on that, you could try that bartending old crone down below, Belle Bonny.
TTW00006716	Hasn't Rivet City been around for longer than twelve years?
TTW00006717	Well, yes, but it was hardly any place of importance until I arrived on the scene. That's all ancient history now. No one would ever care about it.
TTW00006718	If you're going to waste someone's time on that, go bother that idiot, Seagrave Holmes. He spends all his time in the bowels of this place.
TTW00006719	Hasn't Rivet City been around for longer than twelve years?
TTW00006720	Well, yes, but it was hardly any place of importance until I arrived on the scene. That's all ancient history now. No one would ever care about it.
TTW00006721	Hasn't Rivet City been around for longer than twelve years?
TTW00006722	Last feller I remember from back then was Mr. Pinkerton, and he must've left about a decade ago, after that spat with the science team.
TTW00006723	He used to have a storage shed in the broken-off bow of the ship; we always thought he was crazy for keeping stuff there.
TTW00006724	Might have kept a couple records down there, I guess. Careful, though; ship's a bit treacherous down there in her belly!
TTW00006725	Can you think of anyone from back then that might know more?
TTW00006726	Could I ask you about Rivet City's history?
TTW00006727	I heard the place was settled by mercenaries who used to scavenge D.C. But I don't really know.
TTW00006728	Oh, it's not the past of the city that I dwell upon, but the future of its inhabitants.
TTW00006729	But if you're interested, I believe Miss Weatherly or Mr. Bannon would be glad to speak with you on the subject.
TTW00006730	What do you know about Rivet City's history?
TTW00006731	Oh, it's not the past of the city that I dwell upon, but the future of its inhabitants.
TTW00006732	But if you're interested, I believe Mr. Bannon would be glad to speak with you on the subject.
TTW00006733	What do you know about Rivet City's history?
TTW00006734	No, thank you. Please leave Mr. Zimmer and myself alone.
TTW00006735	Know anything about the history of Rivet City?
TTW00006736	But why do you waste your talents on this garbage?
TTW00006737	Junk can be turned into all sorts of useful things. And sometimes, even something wonderful.
TTW00006738	And junk's all we've got left after the world blew up. Everyone's trying to fix it like it was, but nobody's trying to make something that's better.
TTW00006739	I don't understand. Crazy experiments are what keep you going?
TTW00006740	But if you're clever, you can still use the pieces to make other useful things. Maybe even something wonderful, like a mosaic.
TTW00006741	Well, the world broke just like the glass. And everyone's trying to put it back together like it was, but it'll never come together the same way.
TTW00006742	I'll take the Recon Armor.
TTW00006743	All right, here you go. I hope it fits.
TTW00006744	So you think you can handle this?
TTW00006745	I'll take the Power Armor.
TTW00006746	Sure thing. Hopefully it'll give you a bit of an extra edge.
TTW00006747	Okay, so do you think you can hold it together for this?
TTW00006748	Get some suppressing fire over there, now!
TTW00006749	Have you ever considered getting back out there?
TTW00006750	No offense, kid, but you're not exactly the type I'm used to runnin' with.
TTW00006751	Nah, it ain't so bad here. I got some good memories, but that's all I got. No sense in ruining the good ones, you know?
TTW00006752	Are you interested in joining up with me?
TTW00006753	Come back when you're alone and maybe we can work something out.
TTW00006754	Are you interested in joining up with me?
TTW00006755	No, really. Never mind.
TTW00006756	I see how it is. You'd best think twice before fucking with me again.
TTW00006757	Because you've always been a goody two-shoes, so when I need help, it's what you're gonna do, right?
TTW00006758	You're going to help Amata anyway, right? Just make it so we can leave the Vault, and I'll leave and never bother you again.
TTW00006759	Why should I help you, Butch?
TTW00006760	Look, I know I've been kind of a jerk. But I don't deserve to be stuck down here forever. Not when I could have a real life up there like you.
TTW00006761	I mean, you're kind of a jerk sometimes, and you make it work up there. So why not me?
TTW00006762	Just make it so we can leave the Vault, and I can go out there for my new life. Heck, maybe we could form a gang, huh?
TTW00006763	Why should I help you, Butch?
TTW00006764	You left this place, so I bet you hate it as much as I do. So you can imagine how crappy it'd be to be stuck down here forever, yeah?
TTW00006765	Are you gonna force all of us to live like that, now that we've learned we could actually leave and try for something new?
TTW00006766	Just make it so we can get out of this vault, and I'll be gone, man. Then you don't ever need to see me again, okay?
TTW00006767	Why should I help you, Butch?
TTW00006768	Give it up, Autumn. You've lost.
TTW00006769	I beg to differ. The Enclave is at the height of its power.
TTW00006770	Once this facility is operational, the masses will flock to the Enclave for fresh water, protection, and a plan for the future.
TTW00006771	If I kill you, every Treeminder will come after me.
TTW00006772	Oh no no, don't worry about them. When you decide to go down there, I'll have a little chat with Birch and the rest of the gang.
TTW00006773	They usually don't understand a word I say, but I'll make em' come around.
TTW00006774	You want me to murder you?
TTW00006775	Oh no, no, no, no, no. It wouldn't be murder. You'd be doing me a favor.
TTW00006776	The only friends I've got are Bob and those weirdos out there who think I'm a god.
TTW00006777	Look, let's cut the bullshit and get to the matter at hand.
TTW00006778	I had you brought in here to ask a very simple favor.
TTW00006779	Would you please kill me?
TTW00006780	A genetic mutation of that magnitude could only be caused by F.E.V.
TTW00006781	Whoa-ho! Check out the brain on this guy!
TTW00006782	We were pretty deep inside and we found some weird vats of this nasty green goo. Right when we were about to leave, I think we were attacked.
TTW00006783	Last thing I remember before blacking out was something knocking my friend into the stuff.
TTW00006784	You should come with me. I could use a hand.
TTW00006785	No offense, kid, but you're not exactly the type I'm used to runnin' with.
TTW00006786	Nah, it ain't so bad here. I got some good memories, but that's all I got. No sense in ruining the good ones, you know?
TTW00006787	Come back when you're alone and maybe we can work something out.
TTW00006788	You have anything for sale?
TTW00006789	Sure. Have a look. I guess folks in Megaton won't be needing them anymore.
TTW00006790	I have a few things. May as well sell them to you as cart them all the way back to Megaton.
TTW00006791	Everything has its price. Take a look and make me an offer.
TTW00006792	A few odds and ends.
TTW00006793	If the price is right. Make me an offer.
TTW00006794	Various things. You never know what might come in handy.
TTW00006795	What are you selling?
TTW00006796	You might be surprised at what you can use to keep a robot working.
TTW00006797	What are you selling?
TTW00006798	Have a look and see for yourself.
TTW00006799	What are you selling?
TTW00006800	Various things. You never know what might come in handy.
TTW00006801	What are you selling?
TTW00006802	You might be surprised at what you can use to keep a robot working.
TTW00006803	What are you selling?
TTW00006804	Have a look and see for yourself.
TTW00006805	What are you selling?
TTW00006806	Here you go. Let's get out of here.
TTW00006807	Haha! This is gonna be great! Some good ol' fashioned violence!
TTW00006808	Well what'd you get my hopes up for? I can't head out there without supplies, now can I?
TTW00006809	Tell you what: the offer's open. Just come back when you've got the thousand.
TTW00006810	Actually, I don't have 1,000 caps.
TTW00006811	You should write your music down, to keep it preserved for the future.
TTW00006812	My word! You actually found some REAL music paper? I didn't even think it possible.
TTW00006813	Yet here it is. You've really outdone yourself this time. I knew getting the Stradivarius was a challenge, but this is just incredible.
TTW00006814	Guess what I have for you?
TTW00006815	Well, I suppose I could. They aren't my pieces of music by any stretch of the imagination though.
TTW00006816	What's on the menu?
TTW00006817	You're in for a treat, the finest food in D.C. Four stars.
TTW00006818	I need a drink.
TTW00006819	Let ol' Uncle Ahzrukhal help you get rid of the pain.
TTW00006820	A city full of Ghouls, huh?
TTW00006821	That's right. As long as you don't bother us, we won't bother you. Feel free to come and go, trade, sleep, whatever.
TTW00006822	Just make sure that you leave whatever trouble is following you at the door, because we don't want it.
TTW00006823	So, enjoy your stay, smoothskin.
TTW00006824	The Brotherhood of Steel? What's your beef with them?
TTW00006825	Bastards. They don't seem to be able to tell us apart from the Super Mutants. Or, maybe they just don't care. They see us and shoot on sight.
TTW00006826	Jesus Christ! What are you?
TTW00006827	You know, never mind. I'm a Ghoul. Everyone down here: Ghouls. That's what we are. And before you ask "what's a Ghoul", lemme tell you.
TTW00006828	Yeah, well, I can learn, can't I? If you can do it, it's gotta be pretty easy.
TTW00006829	Maybe I can form a gang of my own. Maybe call it the Wasteland Radicals, or maybe the Rad Scorpions. Hey, wanna join?
TTW00006830	I wouldn't be so excited. You have no idea what you're in for.
TTW00006831	Are you kidding me? It's a dream come true, man! Butch the Hairdresser is no more, now I'm gonna be Butch the Wasteland Wanderer!
TTW00006832	Maybe I can form a gang of my own. Maybe call it the Wasteland Radicals, or maybe the Rad Scorpions. Hey, wanna join?
TTW00006833	You're taking this pretty well.
TTW00006834	What?! This is terrible! The vault will become uninhabitable!
TTW00006835	How the hell can this be happening?
TTW00006836	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
TTW00006837	What?! This is terrible! The vault will become uninhabitable!
TTW00006838	How the hell can this be happening?
TTW00006839	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
TTW00006840	Oh my god. The Vault's doomed. Everyone has to evacuate, and there's no way most of them will survive out there.
TTW00006841	How did this happen?
TTW00006842	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
TTW00006843	What in the world? This is insane! We've got to get people to safety! But where can we go?
TTW00006844	You're gonna make sure we're okay out there, right?
TTW00006845	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
TTW00006846	Really? Score!
TTW00006847	Goodbye, hellhole! I'm off to a new life!
TTW00006848	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
TTW00006849	Congratulations, young man! I don’t have to tell you how special this day is, do I?
TTW00006850	Congratulations, young lady! I don’t have to tell you how special this day is, do I?
TTW00006851	Down here in Vault 101, when you turn 10, well, you’re ready to take on your first official Vault responsibilities.
TTW00006852	So here you are. As Overseer, I hereby present to you your very own Pip-Boy 3000! Get used to it.
TTW00006853	Talk. To. Ahzrukhal.
TTW00006854	I don't care.
TTW00006855	I just...
TTW00006856	I don't care.
TTW00006857	Ha ha ha! You told her, Butch!
TTW00006858	Or else what? Yeah, thought so.
TTW00006859	Shut up.
TTW00006860	Glad to hear that.
TTW00006861	Crazy how it sneaks up on you, y'know?
TTW00006862	That's none of your business.
TTW00006863	Um, yeah.
TTW00006864	Was I supposed to do it? I didn't hear Dave saying we had to!
TTW00006865	Yeah, but it'd be better if I could vote.
TTW00006866	Ugh why can't I just vote now?
TTW00006867	Santa Claus.
TTW00006868	Um, I guess so.
TTW00006869	I can't believe it's only a couple of days away.
TTW00006870	It's not a betrayal. This is a free, um, nation... right?
TTW00006871	It could be pretty tough, I guess.
TTW00006872	Hmm, maybe you're right. More trouble than it's worth.
TTW00006873	Have you considered running for the presidency?
TTW00006874	I'm too young! I can't even vote yet.
TTW00006875	No way! You'd have to be crazy to run against him.
TTW00006876	Believe it or not, I used to lead a group bigger than this one on an old caravan route.
TTW00006877	But what am I talking about? Running against Dave would be like betraying him.
TTW00006878	Man, I'd love to be the president. Everybody would have to listen to me or I could just exile them to the Wasteland.
TTW00006879	And the first thing I'd do is make myself the permanent leader so they couldn't vote me out in some other election.
TTW00006880	But there's no need for me to run. One year Dave is just going to make me the leader, just like my Grandpa Tom did for him.
TTW00006881	I'd like to throw my hat into the ring and run for the presidency.
TTW00006882	I'm sorry, but the president must be a citizen of the Republic to run for office. So you do not qualify.
TTW00006883	Um, did Dave say you could do that?
TTW00006884	Who's running in the election?
TTW00006885	Let the people make their choice. I am confident that they will recognize me as their true and proper leader.
TTW00006886	Looks like you might have an opponent in the race, Mister President.
TTW00006887	Wow, really? I've always said that she'd make a great leader, and we've never had a woman lead us before...
TTW00006888	You know, Rosie is running for president now.
TTW00006889	You know, Bob is running for president now.
TTW00006890	Wow, this is the first time we've had so many choices!
TTW00006891	Have you heard that both Bob and Rosie are running in the election?
TTW00006892	You know, Bob is running for president.
TTW00006893	You know, Bob is running for president now.
TTW00006894	Yes, absolutely.
TTW00006895	Well then, there you go. An election is what separates a president like myself from a monarch like my father.
TTW00006896	Assassin? And you really thought you could succeed against the Army of Dave?
TTW00006897	You! Get back here now!
TTW00006898	Run Sammy, run! We can make it!
TTW00006899	Now are you going to give me that sweetroll, or am I going to have to give you a knuckle sandwich?
TTW00006900	Oh, it's great. Everything is perfect. Greta takes good care of us.
TTW00006901	And a hello to you, ma'am.
TTW00006902	Hello. How is everything?
TTW00006903	Hi there, enjoying yourself?
TTW00006904	Stop by the clinic, Patchwork. Greta found one of your fingers over in Carol's Place.
TTW00006905	Come by the clinic some time, you're overdue for a sewing.
TTW00006906	Yes, yes, hello. We covered that already.
TTW00006907	Haven't lost anything permanently. Not yet.
TTW00006908	Hey there, long time, no see! I've got some good stories to tell you later!
TTW00006909	Hey there, you should check out the new stuff I have at the store.
TTW00006910	Hey, you.
TTW00006911	Actually, I haven't noticed. At all.
TTW00006912	I've forgotten the taste of good liquor.
TTW00006913	Dude. Harshing the buzz. Minus five points.
TTW00006914	Well, aren't you a ray of sunshine?
TTW00006915	Ah, yes! Of course, of course, my friend. See me later tonight. We'll make sure that you have all the pick-me-ups that you need.
TTW00006916	Shhh, say no more. See me later, I'll make sure that you want for nothing.
TTW00006917	No need to be shy, my friend. I'll make sure that you have everything that you ever need, so long as you have the caps to pay for it, that is.
TTW00006918	I'm all out of the stuff you sold me yesterday. I need more. Fast.
TTW00006919	The little shits are your problem now. I see 'em around here again, I'm gonna shoot 'em. We clear?
TTW00006920	Look, kid. There's no such thing as monsters.
TTW00006921	Then you can make these things go away!
TTW00006922	Is there any special way to hurt them?
TTW00006923	My pappa had a gun, and he said it hurt those things, but he said they were the dumbest Fuckin' Ants he ever saw.
TTW00006924	He kept telling everyone to "shoot for their antenner" whatever that means.
TTW00006925	Have they always been around?
TTW00006926	Naw. Those things started coming around only in the last few months.
TTW00006927	Okay kid, I said I'd do it. Now scram!
TTW00006928	There's an old portashelter next to the diner near my house. I'll be waiting inside for you to come back.
TTW00006929	And don't you dare leave me alone!
TTW00006930	Is there anywhere you can hide while I search?
TTW00006931	Well, there is the personal shelter next to the old diner.
TTW00006932	I'll head over there and wait inside. Hurry back!
TTW00006933	Okay. I'll go look for your father.
TTW00006934	You will? Really? Thanks a whole lot!
TTW00006935	My house is the one closest to the huge sign and the old diner.
TTW00006936	So, you used to be in charge? How did you end up here?
TTW00006937	That lasted until about 18 years ago, when those ambitious backbiters like Li and her little team showed up.
TTW00006938	She came in with her big "Purity Project" pipe dream, and my whole staff started working with her, those traitors!
TTW00006939	She even took my seat on the council. By then, I was glad to leave it behind. But hell if I'm leaving the city I made great!
TTW00006940	I'd like to discuss the election with you.
TTW00006941	Are you kidding? Dave is dead. How can there be an election with a dead candidate?
TTW00006942	Oh yeah? What about it?
TTW00006943	The election is still going on. What do you want to know?
TTW00006944	I'll help you if I can.
TTW00006945	Election time is always exciting around here.
TTW00006946	Let's see what we have here.
TTW00006947	A vote for Rosie?
TTW00006948	Bob!?
TTW00006949	Wait a minute, has somebody tampered with the ballot box?
TTW00006950	Well, looks like another triumphant victory for myself.
TTW00006951	Well, despite the hiccup, it looks like I am still declared the winner.
TTW00006952	Well, despite the hiccup, it looks like I am still declared the winner.
TTW00006953	ROSIE? Rosie can't be president! NO! This is unfair! This can't be! FINE! I'm LEAVING! See how you people do without me! Enjoy your new president!
TTW00006954	BOB? Bob can't be president! NO! This is unfair! This can't be! FINE! I'm LEAVING! See how you people do without me! Enjoy your new president!
TTW00006955	Hey! Leave that alone. If I wanted it off, I'd turn it off.
TTW00006956	Stop messing with that radio.
TTW00006957	Hey, leave that radio alone.
TTW00006958	That's better.
TTW00006959	Nice to meet you, Quinn.
TTW00006960	You too, stranger. I know a lot of people around here don't take kindly to humans wandering around, but I've met a lot of your people in my travels.
TTW00006961	What? You're not going to tell me how rare it is to see a human in Underworld?
TTW00006962	Me? No, not at all. I'm used to your people. Truth is, I spend most of my time away from Underworld.
TTW00006963	Are you all right?
TTW00006964	I need medical supplies.
TTW00006965	I think I can help you out.
TTW00006966	Be careful with these. They're not toys, you know.
TTW00006967	Yes, what do you need?
TTW00006968	Very well. What do you require?
TTW00006969	This place is coming down around our ears.
TTW00006970	Sorry, kid. Your old man is ant food.
TTW00006971	Your father's dead.
TTW00006972	I guess I already knew. Besides, I'm too tired to cry anymore.
TTW00006973	Bryan, I'm sorry, but your father is dead.
TTW00006974	I guess I already knew. Besides, I'm too tired to cry anymore.
TTW00006975	Looks like all the votes are in, Mister President.
TTW00006976	Not yet. Rosie still hasn't voted.
TTW00006977	Are the votes in, Mister President?
TTW00006978	Rosie somehow came up with the most votes.
TTW00006979	There must be some kind of bug in the voting system.
TTW00006980	So, what are the results?
TTW00006981	Somehow Bob won the election.
TTW00006982	I should have known the little bastard was conspiring against me.
TTW00006983	So, what are the results?
TTW00006984	You never learn, do you? You can't help shooting your mouth off even when you know it's going to get you a bloody nose.
TTW00006985	Uh oh, your dad is giving me a look. I'd better let everybody else have a turn with the birthday boy.
TTW00006986	Have you heard the election results?
TTW00006987	Dave won again? Well, he's the best choice.
TTW00006988	Did you hear that Dave won the election?
TTW00006989	He did? Wow, I'd of never guessed that possible.
TTW00006990	Did you hear Bob won the election?
TTW00006991	Yes, but it's still quite a shock.
TTW00006992	Can you believe that Bob won the election?
TTW00006993	Dave won it I'm sure.
TTW00006994	Hurray!
TTW00006995	Did you hear that Dave won the election?
TTW00006996	Why, did Dave get too old?
TTW00006997	Did you hear that Dave lost the election?
TTW00006998	Did Dave win it again? I'd have voted for him if they'd let me.
TTW00006999	Did Dave win it again? I voted for him you know.
TTW00007000	Rosie's going to be the new leader? What will Dave do?
TTW00007001	Have you heard that Rosie won the election?
TTW00007002	He actually won?
TTW00007003	Have you heard that Bob won the election?
TTW00007004	I won it? Are you sure?
TTW00007005	Looks like you won, Rosie!
TTW00007006	I can't believe my ears.
TTW00007007	Can you believe that you won the election?
TTW00007008	Rosie won, huh? She better not try and boss me around, that's for damn sure.
TTW00007009	Did you hear Rosie won the election?
TTW00007010	I knew I'd win it.
TTW00007011	Now I just got to name this place after me.
TTW00007012	Looks like you'll be the new leader, Bob.
TTW00007013	You got it.
TTW00007014	<sighs> I was saying that you need to get some rest, Carol. You hardly ever sleep at night, don't think that I haven't noticed.
TTW00007015	Good. I'm glad we're clear on that.
TTW00007016	Sure.
TTW00007017	Are you blind? Never mind, don't bother grunting a response. You need to watch these assholes better. Some stuff has turned up missing.
TTW00007018	<grunts>
TTW00007019	She'll be missed.
TTW00007020	She'll be missed.
TTW00007021	Sounds like you need some of Ahzrukhal's special cough medicine.
TTW00007022	Poor doc Barrows, you people are falling apart without him, aren't you?
TTW00007023	You really suck at conversation, robot.
TTW00007024	Well, that's good. That's good to hear, Cerberus. Anything else going on?
TTW00007025	Threat level alpha. Disturbance level zero.
TTW00007026	Dammit. I thought I fixed that. No time now, resume your patrol Cerberus. I'll deal with it later.
TTW00007027	For Christ's sake, that's the fourth time this month. Just go back on patrol, I'm sure you'll be fine.
TTW00007028	Unit weapon system 2B ammunition level low. Please service at earliest convenience.
TTW00007029	Unit cognition system experiencing fluctuating contact. Unable to determine source of failure.
TTW00007030	Unit target recognition system contains failure of an unknown class. Advise immediate unit service for repair.
TTW00007031	Unit locomotion system contains a class two failure. Currently operable. Failure will escalate to class one with a 47% probability.
TTW00007032	Well, give the report, you old bucket of bolts. I haven't got all day.
TTW00007033	Well? Do you think I asked just out of curiosity? Give me the report, dammit.
TTW00007034	Thanks, Greta.
TTW00007035	Wow. Well, okay. I'll go have a look.
TTW00007036	I could go for some noodles. You got any?
TTW00007037	No refunds if you don't keep it down this time. Now, what can I get you?
TTW00007038	I'll just be here sobering up until you get back.
TTW00007039	Thanks, Greta.
TTW00007040	Sure, if you don't mind waiting a few minutes.
TTW00007041	You got it.
TTW00007042	I don't care, really. Whatever takes the pain away.
TTW00007043	That's what I'm here for.
TTW00007044	Well then, what are you complaining about? Oh, I forgot, you're a bitter bastard. Just tell me what you want to eat.
TTW00007045	Very funny, Greta. I'd happily prepare my own meals if I could ever get anything was wasn't moldy, rotten, or still squirming.
TTW00007046	If you don't like what we have, Crowley, you can always go hunt rats in the tunnels with the ferals.
TTW00007047	Yep.
TTW00007048	Excellent. I'll have another task for you soon.
TTW00007049	I've got something on my mind, Charon. I had asked you to do something and you never reported back to me. You did it, didn't you?
TTW00007050	What?
TTW00007051	You know that I can't stop worrying about you. Just think about it, okay?
TTW00007052	They don't need to worry about me, Greta, and neither do you. I'll be okay.
TTW00007053	C'mon, Carol. It's me, I can see through you. It's gotten so bad that the customers have started to notice.
TTW00007054	Oh, Greta, baby. You don't need to worry about me, I was just lost in my thoughts. You know how it is.
TTW00007055	Oh, you'd be surprised. I may be old, but this place'd shut down without me. Just think about what I said, we'll talk later.
TTW00007056	Don't you threaten me. You wouldn't dare do that, these people would have your head.
TTW00007057	Sure, sure, you're here to make money, and I fix all of your crap so that you can keep right on making that money. What would happen if I stopped?
TTW00007058	Stop serving him? This is a bar. How am I supposed to make money if I'm not serving booze? If he's got money, I'll give him whatever he asks for.
TTW00007059	It's about Patchwork. You need to stop feeding him booze, Ahzrukhal. The boy can barely stand most of the time, and you just keep serving him.
TTW00007060	I want you to stop giving Patchwork booze when he's already drunk. You're gonna kill the boy.
TTW00007061	No time to talk right now, Winthrop. Come back later.
TTW00007062	Okay, great. What's next?
TTW00007063	Well, with the terminal, I can turn off the collars and open up the gate. But they're not gonna just let us walk out of here, you know?
TTW00007064	There's always at least one guard near the pen, and someone's gotta get rid of him.
TTW00007065	Since we can't just walk around like we own the place, you're gonna have to do it. You get me?
TTW00007066	Could I help with the election, Mister President?
TTW00007067	Alright sure, why not. The people have a tendency to wait until the last minute to vote, but I'd like just to get it over with.
TTW00007068	I'll spare a few caps if you just tell each of the adults to get over to the voting booth sometime today so I cinch the victory.
TTW00007069	Not that I have anything to worry about. The people know who their leader is in this Republic.
TTW00007070	So who can tell me how Dave saved the people from the wrath of Tom?
TTW00007071	Somebody name three things Tom did wrong before Dave became the president.
TTW00007072	Anybody know what year Dave took back the government for the people?
TTW00007073	I hope you're paying attention, Rachael. I'll give another pop quiz. I'll do it.
TTW00007074	Remember your homework is to prepare a speech on the "Merits of Dave."
TTW00007075	All right, all right. I'll see what I can do.
TTW00007076	That name is not to be spoken within this Citadel. Do you understand? I wish it were not so, truly I do, but he is Outcast. He has been judged.
TTW00007077	You'll make do, Bowditch. You always do.
TTW00007078	Keep moving.
TTW00007079	If only we were all so lucky. I have work to do.
TTW00007080	You know me, Dusk. I was born ready for anything!
TTW00007081	For someone who should be preparing for an assault, you seem to have a lot of time to be social.
TTW00007082	A few people. But I don't get tired of hearing it.
TTW00007083	You're really scary, Dusk. Has anyone ever told you that?
TTW00007084	You're a frightening woman, Dusk. Anyone ever tell you that?
TTW00007085	A couple of inches? So you'd have taken out his nose instead of his eye? So what!
TTW00007086	Bullshit. That third shot dropped by a couple of inches.
TTW00007087	Carry on.
TTW00007088	Meh. Been better.
TTW00007089	I haven't heard a damn thing.
TTW00007090	Nothing at all.
TTW00007091	Nice night.
TTW00007092	Oh, don't worry about me. You just go enjoy your drink.
TTW00007093	I'm fine, I'm just fine. Thank you for your concern. I'm fine.
TTW00007094	Yes, I am, Mr. Ahzrukhal.
TTW00007095	Sorry, I don't mean to pry. It just seems like you should be doing more than this.
TTW00007096	Some other jackass should be pulling nighttime guard duty. Maybe I'll go have a little chat with Eulogy about that.
TTW00007097	It just seems like you do most of the work around here.
TTW00007098	Yeah, so maybe I get a raw deal sometimes. Everybody does out here. That's the way shit goes.
TTW00007099	But maybe it's time that changed. Maybe I go see Eulogy about that right now, in fact.
TTW00007100	I was just wondering, really. I figure you must make more than the others.
TTW00007101	Oh, that isn't what I want at all. People already have all sorts of ways to kill them. We don't need a more lethal Mole Rat trap. Just a better one.
TTW00007102	I guess it's back to the drawing board for that repellent. I wonder if I can make it into some sort of fuel. Anyway, I'll just take that.
TTW00007103	Well, maybe the Raiders will try reading a few of the books. Maybe it'll open their eyes to a few things.
TTW00007104	Still, it's good to know it's standing. Maybe I'll inspire someone to take care of the place. Have some caps as payment for that little bit of hope.
TTW00007105	Oh, it's still there, but it's full of Raiders. The place is a death trap.
TTW00007106	I'm taking a break from the research.
TTW00007107	Don't take too long. The sooner the book's done, the more people we can save with it!
TTW00007108	No, Carol. I'd love to hear your story.
TTW00007109	I was born in 2051, so yes, that makes me a Pre-War Ghoul.
TTW00007110	Not going to talk about it. Don't ask.
TTW00007111	Not your business.
TTW00007112	Let me see the real goods.
TTW00007113	Certainly, my friend.
TTW00007114	I must ask that you speak to no one about our transactions.
TTW00007115	He doesn't say much, does he?
TTW00007116	His company is rather refreshing, isn't it? But don't mistake his brevity for stupidity. That would be very unwise.
TTW00007117	Underestimating an opponent has been the last mistake of far too many individuals throughout history.
TTW00007118	Fine, in a little bit. Geez.
TTW00007119	I bet Ralph isn't doing anything, why don't you ask him?
TTW00007120	Why don't you ask Rachael if she can play?
TTW00007121	You're on your own, pal. I've got more important things to do.
TTW00007122	That's it, huh? Just toss me out of the box and into the meat grinder?
TTW00007123	Thanks for nothing, asshole.
TTW00007124	We'll have to run for it.
TTW00007125	Okay, if you say so. I'll be right behind you. If you can get me to the front gate, I can take it from there.
TTW00007126	We need to be careful. Stay low and stay quiet.
TTW00007127	You got it. I'll stay right with you. Get me to the front gate, and I can make a run for it from there.
TTW00007128	Spy on what? Your trailer-home?
TTW00007129	If the Capitol Building does not meet your incredible standards, feel free to escort yourself out. In fact, just leave now.
TTW00007130	Let's go.
TTW00007131	Right behind you.
TTW00007132	"A slice of melon may be divine, but lest you spoil the meal, mind the rind"
TTW00007133	Stand clear, vagabonds, rapscallions and Ne'erdowells.
TTW00007134	Time for your walk, family pet.
TTW00007135	Do you remember the day the war started?
TTW00007136	I was just a little girl then. We couldn't afford a space in one of the Vaults. I remember filing down into that shelter, my father rushing me in.
TTW00007137	Oh, great! And you look like it went fine! So, how was it?
TTW00007138	I got through Minefield alive, and I even brought you a present. <Lie.>
TTW00007139	My very own landmine! Just what I've always wanted. Well, always since I sent you out on this, anyway.
TTW00007140	Now, tell me all about it. What was it like going through there? What's it like disarming a landmine?
TTW00007141	I got through Minefield alive, and I even brought you a present. <Lie.>
TTW00007142	Oh, come on. You barely even left! I can't imagine you tested it on a reasonable number of subjects so quickly. It can't have been a good sample size.
TTW00007143	I tested it out, and it works just fine. <Lie.>
TTW00007144	Yes, he's safe. Now get moving!
TTW00007145	Okay, okay!
TTW00007146	Don't follow me. You go out the normal way, and meet Sammy and me outside.
TTW00007147	I got him out, all right. Now it's your turn.
TTW00007148	You saved him? Really?
TTW00007149	Thank you so much. I'll make it up to you somehow, I promise.
TTW00007150	Now I have to get out. Don't follow me; you go out the normal way. We'll meet outside.
TTW00007151	Did you hear anyone mention anything about an Ant Queen?
TTW00007152	Something about "laying eggs" whatever that means.
TTW00007153	He said the queen would never be above ground. That he'd have to find her. Weird huh?
TTW00007154	Well? Why are you still standing there?
TTW00007155	I'm tracking down the location and equipment used to perform the face job.
TTW00007156	Can I have some time to think about it?
TTW00007157	Of all the Wastelanders I had to bump into it has to be one with a conscience.
TTW00007158	Let's keep it an open invitation then. I don't want to wait until the next person visits, it could be years.
TTW00007159	Just, just, think about it, okay?
TTW00007160	Ok, I'll do it.
TTW00007161	You will? Oh, oh! You've... you've made us so happy! Isn't that right Bob?
TTW00007162	Just give me a little time to say goodbye to good old Bob and then I'll be ready.
TTW00007163	Officer Kendall! Help!
TTW00007164	No! There is no way my guys are dead!
TTW00007165	If there's even the slimmest chance of surviving, they'll do it.
TTW00007166	If you won't go, stop wasting my fucking time and find me someone who will!
TTW00007167	Why don't you attempt a rescue? Your legs broken or something?
TTW00007168	Are you completely stupid?
TTW00007169	I can barely walk right now, let alone climb a skyscraper. If I could even hold a pistol, I would go get my guys right now!
TTW00007170	I'm using everything I've got just standing here talking to you. Get the point?
TTW00007171	You look terrible. Maybe I shouldn't have woken you up so quickly.
TTW00007172	Heh, I feel worse than I look, but that doesn't even matter to me. I'm just worried about the rest of the Rangers.
TTW00007173	I don't even know if they're still alive.
TTW00007174	Why do you want this code so badly?
TTW00007175	You know why. We can't start the purifier without it. The longer the purifier isn't running, the more people suffer.
TTW00007176	Now I'm running out of patience. I want that code, and I want it now.
TTW00007177	Wait here.
TTW00007178	<whine>
TTW00007179	I shall wait here until you return for me.
TTW00007180	Don't piss around, I don't want to be standing here with my thumb up my ass all day.
TTW00007181	I shall reflect on the battles past and the battles to come until your return.
TTW00007182	Fine, but what am I supposed to do here? Work on my needlepoint or something?
TTW00007183	I will keep this location secure!
TTW00007184	But it's so boring all alone!
TTW00007185	Let's trade equipment.
TTW00007186	If this means more stuff for Butch, I'm all for it.
TTW00007187	Very well.
TTW00007188	You're always welcome to take whatever you want, lover.
TTW00007189	Sure, gimme whatever you got.
TTW00007190	Yes, by all means, let's.
TTW00007191	RL-3 comes equipped with everything a good soldier needs! But your RL-3 can assist in carrying equipment, if needed.
TTW00007192	In the words of Elder Theis: "A Brother well equipped is a Brother keeping to his duty."
TTW00007193	<whimper>
TTW00007194	Enough about tactics.
TTW00007195	<bark>
TTW00007196	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
TTW00007197	I've had no compelling reason to do anything different from what you asked.
TTW00007198	Keep hanging back.
TTW00007199	Ha! Good plan. I'll try to get around behind 'em. I like how you think, kid.
TTW00007200	It was my goal to continue doing so until you told me otherwise.
TTW00007201	Keep hanging back.
TTW00007202	Very well. I will seek out better positions to cover you while you forge ahead.
TTW00007203	That's what I'm doing. Why do you think I'm standing back here in East Bumfuck?
TTW00007204	Keep hanging back.
TTW00007205	Ha! Good plan. I'll try to get around behind 'em. I like how you think, kid.
TTW00007206	I get any farther, I might as well be back in the bar. And that's sounding like a better idea all the time, trust me.
TTW00007207	Keep hanging back.
TTW00007208	What, don't you like my aftershave?
TTW00007209	Yeah, got it. Flanking and tactics and stuff. Right.
TTW00007210	Keep Hanging Back.
TTW00007211	If you insist, sir, but RL-3 functions best when closer to the fight!
TTW00007212	Keep hanging back.
TTW00007213	Stealth flanking mode active!
TTW00007214	By all means. I simply hope I'm not too far in reserve, in case of unforeseen trouble.
TTW00007215	Keep hanging back.
TTW00007216	A sound plan. I trust this isn't simply to avoid being seen with a Super Mutant?
TTW00007217	Eulogy used to like me to stay ten steps behind him. Usually.
TTW00007218	Keep hanging back.
TTW00007219	As you wish, but I'm not letting you out of my sight.
TTW00007220	<pant> <pant>
TTW00007221	Keep hanging back.
TTW00007222	<bark> <bark>
TTW00007223	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
TTW00007224	<bark>
TTW00007225	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
TTW00007226	<bark> <bark>
TTW00007227	Stay close to me.
TTW00007228	I thought it so.
TTW00007229	You're good where you are.
TTW00007230	It allows for flexibility. A wise choice on your part.
TTW00007231	I am happy if you are happy.
TTW00007232	You're good where you are.
TTW00007233	As you wish.
TTW00007234	You're damn right I'm good, kid.
TTW00007235	You're good where you are.
TTW00007236	Sure, kid. Whatever you say.
TTW00007237	Oh, I'm the best, baby.
TTW00007238	You're good where you are.
TTW00007239	You're good where you are.
TTW00007240	Understood, sir. Proceeding as normal!
TTW00007241	You're good where you are.
TTW00007242	RL-3 will maintain a tactical distance!
TTW00007243	I'll endeavor to continue, then.
TTW00007244	You're good where you are.
TTW00007245	A sound decision, yes.
TTW00007246	Glad you like it.
TTW00007247	You're good where you are.
TTW00007248	As you wish, lover.
TTW00007249	<pant> <pant>
TTW00007250	You're good where you are.
TTW00007251	<bark> <bark>
TTW00007252	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
TTW00007253	If you wanna get closer to me, that's all you gotta say, girl.
TTW00007254	You mean how close you're following me, right? Sure, what's up?
TTW00007255	Is there something that you wish me to change?
TTW00007256	How close would you like?
TTW00007257	As you wish. What about it?
TTW00007258	I am open to your suggestions.
TTW00007259	Give me my marching orders, sir.
TTW00007260	<bark>
TTW00007261	<pant pant>
TTW00007262	Just tell me where you want me.
TTW00007263	I want you to use ranged weapons.
TTW00007264	Very well. I shall cover your approach.
TTW00007265	Sir, yes sir!
TTW00007266	You're not bad with a ranged weapon. Keep it up.
TTW00007267	<whimper>[Dogmeat is incapable of ranged attacks and will continue using melee attacks.]
TTW00007268	Excellent, will do.
TTW00007269	Switch to a melee weapon.
TTW00007270	They shall know the power of my steel!
TTW00007271	<bark> <bark>
TTW00007272	By your command, sir!
TTW00007273	<bark>
TTW00007274	I like what you're doing. Stick with the melee.
TTW00007275	Sir, yes sir!
TTW00007276	I like what you're doing. Stick with the melee.
TTW00007277	<Makes beeping sounds>
TTW00007278	<Weapon Type::Melee>
TTW00007279	<Makes beeping sounds>
TTW00007280	<Weapon Type::Melee>
TTW00007281	Let's talk about something else.
TTW00007282	Yes, commander?
TTW00007283	<bark>
TTW00007284	That's all. Let's get going.
TTW00007285	Lead on!
TTW00007286	<bark> <bark>
TTW00007287	I want you to change your combat style.
TTW00007288	What do you think would be best?
TTW00007289	Oh yeah? To what?
TTW00007290	A member of the Brotherhood is trained in all weapons as an Initiate. What do you wish?
TTW00007291	I can stab, I can shoot, I can do lots of things. What's your pleasure?
TTW00007292	In what way?
TTW00007293	What would you like? I think you'll find I'm quite flexible.
TTW00007294	Standing by for further orders.
TTW00007295	<bark>
TTW00007296	Let's talk about your tactics.
TTW00007297	Yes, sir? What, sir?
TTW00007298	<bark>
TTW00007299	I just wanted to make sure you were still here. Goodbye.
TTW00007300	Old war-bots never die! We just rust away.
TTW00007301	Charming.
TTW00007302	As I am a "man of my word", there is nowhere else that I could possibly be.
TTW00007303	Yeah, well the Snakes don't need you, anyway! We don't need nothing but liquor and guns! Yeah!
TTW00007304	If there's one thing I've learned, it's patience. I can wait.
TTW00007305	You big tease!
TTW00007306	Not just yet. I wanted to talk to you about something.
TTW00007307	No time to dilly-dally, sir! What is it?
TTW00007308	Certainly. What is it?
TTW00007309	Yeah? What do you want now?
TTW00007310	What do you wish to speak to me about?
TTW00007311	Oh, come on. What?
TTW00007312	Yes, best to formulate a plan. What is it?
TTW00007313	Oh, make it quick. I'm getting bored. I hate being bored.
TTW00007314	<aroo?>
TTW00007315	Hold on, boy.
TTW00007316	<aroo?>
TTW00007317	Hold on, Dogmeat.
TTW00007318	Let's get going.
TTW00007319	As you command.
TTW00007320	Right on. I'm ready for more action.
TTW00007321	Very well. I stand by your side.
TTW00007322	Yeah, let's hit it!
TTW00007323	Yes, sir!
TTW00007324	With all due haste.
TTW00007325	Oh yes, let's!
TTW00007326	<bark!>
TTW00007327	Come on, boy!
TTW00007328	It's time for us to part ways.
TTW00007329	Yeah yeah, very funny.
TTW00007330	Get lost, Butch. You're fired.
TTW00007331	Are you certain that this is what you wish?
TTW00007332	You're fired, Charon.
TTW00007333	Leave me alone, Clover. You're fired.
TTW00007334	<aroo?>
TTW00007335	It's too dangerous here, pup. Go wait for me at Vault 101.
TTW00007336	What? Are you serious?
TTW00007337	Get out of here, Jericho. You're fired.
TTW00007338	Are you certain?
TTW00007339	You're fired, Fawkes. Stop following me around.
TTW00007340	I think I may have misheard that order.
TTW00007341	You're fired, RL-3. Leave immediately.
TTW00007342	Are you certain?
TTW00007343	We must part ways, Paladin Cross.
TTW00007344	<aroo?>
TTW00007345	It's too dangerous here, Dogmeat. Go wait for me at Vault 101.
TTW00007346	<aroo?>
TTW00007347	It's too dangerous here, pup. Go wait for me at Gibson Scrapyard.
TTW00007348	<aroo?>
TTW00007349	It's too dangerous here, Dogmeat. Go wait for me at Gibson Scrapyard.
TTW00007350	I think we should travel together.
TTW00007351	<Happy beeping> 
TTW00007352	Sorry man. I don't know what's gotten into you but you're just a little too intense for me. Maybe come back after you've chilled out and we'll see.
TTW00007353	Want to head back outside, Butch?
TTW00007354	Sorry man. I don't know what's gotten into you but you're just a little too intense for me. Maybe come back after you've chilled out and we'll see.
TTW00007355	Want to head back outside, Butch?
TTW00007356	Nah, I'm good. I only roll with Tunnel Snakes. Come back when you're on your own.
TTW00007357	Want to head back outside, Butch?
TTW00007358	I guess I can let you back into the gang. Once a Snake, always a Snake, huh? Let's roll!
TTW00007359	Want to head back outside, Butch?
TTW00007360	I regret that I cannot join you at this time. You seem to already have someone in your employ.
TTW00007361	I want you to come with me, Charon.
TTW00007362	You are my employer and I will do as you command.
TTW00007363	I want you to come with me, Charon.
TTW00007364	Sorry, honey. Three's a crowd. Come back when I can have you all to myself.
TTW00007365	How would you like to come with me, Clover?
TTW00007366	Absolutely, lover. Let's go have some fun.
TTW00007367	How would you like to come with me, Clover?
TTW00007368	<bark!>
TTW00007369	Come on, pup. Let's go!
TTW00007370	<bark!>
TTW00007371	Come on, Dogmeat. Let's go!
TTW00007372	Sorry, kid. I just can't roll with someone like you.
TTW00007373	If you pick up a few bad habits, maybe I'll change my mind.
TTW00007374	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
TTW00007375	Sorry, kid. I'd love to, but there just ain't enough supplies to go around. Ditch the loser and then we'll talk.
TTW00007376	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
TTW00007377	Thank Christ. I really didn't want to go back to Megaton after what happened to that place.
TTW00007378	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
TTW00007379	Thank Christ. I thought I was gonna grow a fourth arm sitting next to all this fucking radiation.
TTW00007380	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
TTW00007381	Now that's what I like to hear! I'll be right behind you!
TTW00007382	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
TTW00007383	My friend, I am saddened to hear that you have turned away from a noble path.
TTW00007384	Return to me when you have learned to take right action, and I will walk with you.
TTW00007385	Care to join me, Fawkes? I would appreciate your assistance.
TTW00007386	My friend, I would love to join you, but I fear that your traveling companion would not accept me.
TTW00007387	Return to me when you are alone, and I will join you.
TTW00007388	Care to join me, Fawkes? I would appreciate your assistance.
TTW00007389	I owe you no less than my life. How could I refuse?
TTW00007390	Care to join me, Fawkes? I would appreciate your assistance.
TTW00007391	Sir, I regret to inform you that this unit cannot accept orders from an officer under a Court Martial!
TTW00007392	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
TTW00007393	Sir, I apologize, but a squad is less effective when it is over crowded.
TTW00007394	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
TTW00007395	I should definitely say so! Time to roll out!
TTW00007396	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
TTW00007397	It is regrettable, but I cannot follow one such as you. Restore your good name, and perhaps I shall reconsider.
TTW00007398	I would like your assistance once again, Paladin Cross.
TTW00007399	It is my sincere wish to join you, but so long as you travel with one who is not of the Brotherhood, I simply cannot risk myself.
TTW00007400	I would like your assistance once again, Paladin Cross.
TTW00007401	And it is my duty to offer it, as I have sworn. I shall follow and protect you.
TTW00007402	I would like your assistance once again, Paladin Cross.
TTW00007403	[Dogmeat growls at Sergeant RL-3's presence.]
TTW00007404	[Dogmeat growls at ED-E's presence.]
TTW00007405	[Dogmeat growls at Rex's presence.]
TTW00007406	[Dogmeat's pup growls at Sergeant RL-3's presence.]
TTW00007407	[Dogmeat's pup growls at ED-E's presence.]
TTW00007408	[Dogmeat's pup growls at Rex's presence.]
TTW00007409	Sir, I regret to inform you that this unit cannot accept orders from an irresponsible officer!
TTW00007410	It is a soldier's duty to soldier, not to play hero!
TTW00007411	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
TTW00007412	<Makes beeping sounds>
TTW00007413	<Companion Protocol::Begin>
TTW00007414	<bark! bark!>
TTW00007415	I'm ready when you are.
TTW00007416	Let's travel together.
TTW00007417	Well, there are worse things happening in the world, right?
TTW00007418	After spending thirty years of my life hiding my association with the Enclave, I'd love to stroll the wasteland with a twitchy Eyebot.
TTW00007419	Back in your good graces again? I knew you'd see the light.
TTW00007420	A courier, doctor, and a cybernetic dog. After we deal with the whole "imminent conquest of New Vegas" problem, we should open an act at the Tops.
TTW00007421	Words cannot contain my excitement at the chance to throw myself headlong into danger with you again, boss.
TTW00007422	Come, Raul, adventure awaits!
TTW00007423	Let's go make trouble.
TTW00007424	<Makes beeping sounds>
TTW00007425	<Companion Protocol->Conflict::Rex>
TTW00007426	<Makes beeping sounds>
TTW00007427	<Companion Protocol->Conflict::Dogmeat>
TTW00007428	<Makes beeping sounds>
TTW00007429	<Companion Protocol->Conflict::Sergeant RL-3>
TTW00007430	[Rex growls at ED-E's presence.]
TTW00007431	[Rex growls at Dogmeat's presence.]
TTW00007432	[Rex growls at Sergeant RL-3's presence.]
TTW00007433	Can't be any worse than here.
TTW00007434	All right then, let's get the train rolling.
TTW00007435	You got one too many by my count.
TTW00007436	What, you teasing me? Lose one, then ask me again.
TTW00007437	Not in the mood for a threesome. Today.
TTW00007438	That'd be lovely, dearie.
TTW00007439	Sounds good. Let's get out of here.
TTW00007440	Would that I could. Although you are now my employer, traveling in such a large crowd would be foolish.
TTW00007441	I shall wait here until your party is smaller.
TTW00007442	As you wish.
TTW00007443	Whoa! What the fuck was that?
TTW00007444	Ahzrukhal was an evil bastard. So long as he held my contract, I was honor bound to do as he commanded.
TTW00007445	But now you are my employer, which freed me to rid the world of that disgusting rat. And now, for good or ill, I serve you.
TTW00007446	But I cannot come with you. Although you are now my employer, traveling in such a large crowd would be foolish.
TTW00007447	I shall wait here until your party is smaller.
TTW00007448	Ahzrukhal was an evil bastard. So long as he held my contract, I was honor bound to do as he commanded.
TTW00007449	But now you are my employer, which freed me to rid the world of that disgusting rat. And now, for good or ill, I serve you.
TTW00007450	Yes.
TTW00007451	That's right, Charon. Have you come to say goodbye?
TTW00007452	Ahzrukhal. I am told that I am no longer in your service.
TTW00007453	Slow down, there. I have good news. I'm your new employer.
TTW00007454	You purchased my contract from Ahzrukhal? So, I am no longer in his service. That is good to know.
TTW00007455	Please, wait here. I must take care of something.
TTW00007456	Oh no. None of that. You belong to me now.
TTW00007457	I belong to no one. If you are my new employer, then I will serve you. But first, I must take care of something. Wait here.
TTW00007458	I'll give you 5,000 caps for it.
TTW00007459	You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
TTW00007460	I'll give you 4,000 caps for it.
TTW00007461	I'll give you the pleasure of informing Charon yourself.
TTW00007462	[FAILED] You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
TTW00007463	I'll give you 3,000 caps for it.
TTW00007464	I'll give you the pleasure of informing Charon yourself.
TTW00007465	[FAILED] You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
TTW00007466	I'll give you 2,000 caps for it.
TTW00007467	I'll give you the pleasure of informing Charon yourself.
TTW00007468	[FAILED] You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
TTW00007469	I'll give you 1,000 caps for it.
TTW00007470	I'll give you the pleasure of informing Charon yourself.
TTW00007471	[FAILED] You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
TTW00007472	I want to talk to you about Charon's contract.
TTW00007473	I knew you'd change your mind. Just remember, Charon is a valuable asset to me and he doesn't come cheap. Are you ready to deal?
TTW00007474	Oh? Would you, now? He is a highly valuable asset to me and to the Ninth Circle. What did you have in mind?
TTW00007475	What were you offering to trade?
TTW00007476	I'll trade you five bits of Scrap Metal for a Stimpak, a pack of RadAway, or a dose of Rad-X. Easy deal.
TTW00007477	I have some scrap metal for you.
TTW00007478	Really? Great! I can finally get around to patching up the heaters.
TTW00007479	Yes. As in: I won't cut your throat and watch you die gasping for air.
TTW00007480	Yes. As in, "I won't make a five egg omelet out of your face."
TTW00007481	What do you do around here, Winthrop?
TTW00007482	Me? I keep every hunk of old rusted Pre-War garbage around here in operating condition.
TTW00007483	We've got lights, water, and ventilation all running off the old crap they used to keep this place going for the tourists.
TTW00007484	Me? I keep every hunk of old rusted Pre-War garbage around here in operating condition.
TTW00007485	We've got lights, water, and ventilation all running off the old crap they used to keep this place going for the tourists.
TTW00007486	We used to have two guards here. Me and an older girl named Caps.
TTW00007487	But since the last time Raiders attacked, it's just been me.
TTW00007488	I really miss Caps.
TTW00007489	Are you the only guard on the front gate?
TTW00007490	Now I am, yeah. But I'm a good guard, and no one's getting by me, now.
TTW00007491	Are you the only guard on the front gate?
TTW00007492	Yeah. Right now, we don't even have anyone to cover me when I'm asleep.
TTW00007493	Now leave me alone, I've got to be ready for duty soon.
TTW00007494	Don't you guard the front gate?
TTW00007495	You brought back Penny and Sammy and Squirrel? Well, I guess that does make you a pretty big hero. Thanks!
TTW00007496	I'm Lucy, and I'm pretty much the mom around here. And that means I spend a lot of time kissing boo-boos and making things all better.
TTW00007497	I rescued those captured kids. I'm a big hero.
TTW00007498	Well, if you brought them back, then I guess that explains why RJ let you in. So, I guess that does make you a big hero.
TTW00007499	I'm Lucy, and I'm pretty much mommy to the folks here. I try to keep them safe, and when that's not enough I patch up their cuts and bruises.
TTW00007500	And when that's not enough, I make sure they get a funeral. Thanks for making sure I didn't have to do that for three more of mine.
TTW00007501	I rescued those captured kids. I'm a big hero.
TTW00007502	That was you? Well, you brought my sister Penny back, so sure, I'll call you a big hero. Thank you very much.
TTW00007503	I'm Joseph, and as the oldest kid in Lamplight, I'm pretty much a teacher by default. I also try to keep the kids clean and fresh-faced.
TTW00007504	I'm not sure if there's anything I can teach you, but if you need a haircut or the like, just say the word. And thanks again.
TTW00007505	I'm the big hero who saved those kidnapped kids.
TTW00007506	Oh, really? So you're saying you brought back three more hungry mouths, too? Great, you're just making my day better and better!
TTW00007507	Look, I'm Eclair, and I'm in charge of the crap we call food down here. And we've got precious little enough to go around as it is.
TTW00007508	So, yeah, thanks for bringing those folks back alive, but don't expect me to throw you a big party over it.
TTW00007509	Hey, I rescued those kids from the Slavers. You owe me some respect, kid.
TTW00007510	You saved Penny and Sammy and Squirrel? I can see why RJ let you in! Thanks, for all of us!
TTW00007511	I'm Lucy, and I pretty much spend my days playing mommy around here. I spend a lot of time kissing boo-boos and making things better.
TTW00007512	If you get a scraped knee or stubbed toe, come see me. Same if you get shot in the face or burns all over, but I can only promise so much.
TTW00007513	I'm a guest in town. Mayor MacCready let me in for rescuing your friends.
TTW00007514	That was you? Well, my most sincere thanks, then. You brought my sister Penny back to me, and I couldn't ask more than that.
TTW00007515	I'm Joseph, and if there's ever anything I can do for you here, just name it!
TTW00007516	As the oldest kid in town, I spend most of my time teaching, but I do what I can to keep the kids clean and fresh-faced.
TTW00007517	Say, if you're ever looking for a haircut, I'd be glad to offer my services. You only have to ask!
TTW00007518	Mayor MacCready let me in for rescuing those kids.
TTW00007519	Oh, you think Sammy and the rest wouldn't have gotten back on their own eventually? I taught him better than that.
TTW00007520	Well, if you're sticking around, you ought to know that I'm Princess, and I call the shots around here.
TTW00007521	And don't forget it, mungo!
TTW00007522	The Mayor let me in because I rescued some of your friends.
TTW00007523	That's good, they don't like me having my gun in town, so I gotta turn it in first, so if I had to shoot you you'd have to wait a bit.
TTW00007524	My name's Zip. I don't think that's short for anything, because I don't know what it'd be short for. Zippy? Zipperick? Ziptholomew?
TTW00007525	So yeah, it's good to meet you, big kid, and maybe you've got big stuff on top of you. Do you have any Nuka-Cola, maybe? Yes? Please?
TTW00007526	No, you don't need to shoot me. Just think of me as a big kid.
TTW00007527	Oh, that's good because Mayor MacCready says I can't have my gun in town anymore, not since last time, but that was totally an accident anyway!
TTW00007528	That reminds me, got any Nuka-Cola? 'Cause if I'm not gonna have a gun in town, then it must be okay for me to have more Nuka, right?
TTW00007529	Anyway, everyone calls me Zip, you know, like a zipper, only not really like that because I'm not made of metal, but I do go up and down, I guess.
TTW00007530	No, no, I'm not here to cause any problems! You don't need your gun!
TTW00007531	Really? Because I heard from the mayor about the sorts of deals you make when you trade. None for you.
TTW00007532	Let's trade.
TTW00007533	I hope you brought me some cool stuff!
TTW00007534	Let's trade.
TTW00007535	Yeah, I heard about the sorts of things you'd do for this fungus. Well, you're cut off. Go scrounge your own food.
TTW00007536	I'd like some food.
TTW00007537	Sure thing, pal! Special deals for us kids!
TTW00007538	Let's trade.
TTW00007539	Sure thing, mungo. We don't have much to spare, so get ready to pay.
TTW00007540	I'd like some food.
TTW00007541	Bon appetit.
TTW00007542	I'd like some food.
TTW00007543	Enjoy, if you've got the caps.
TTW00007544	I'd like some food.
TTW00007545	All right. Now, hold still.
TTW00007546	Can you give me a haircut?
TTW00007547	Certainly. How would you like to look?
TTW00007548	Can you give me a haircut?
TTW00007549	Why Zip? Or why do I have a nickname at all? I mean, why don't people just call me Ricky? Or Yancy? Or Eustace P. Vanderbanger the Third?
TTW00007550	I mean, they say it's because I'm so fast, but that doesn't make sense because I don't think I'm all that fast, it's just that they're all so slow!
TTW00007551	I guess it's just one of those mysteries that'll never really get answered, sort of like how people made the bubbles in Nuka-Cola. Say, got any Cola?
TTW00007552	Why are you called Zip?
TTW00007553	I hold open classes every morning for anyone who's got an interest in learning about a subject. Obviously, voluntary attendance is usually low.
TTW00007554	I wouldn't normally let someone like you sit in, but since you saved Penny's life, it's the least I can offer.
TTW00007555	Would you like to hear our history? It's something of a favorite.
TTW00007556	Could you tell me about this class?
TTW00007557	Where can I get some food?
TTW00007558	Right here. Welcome to our fungus pools. Eat up!
TTW00007559	Hee hee! Okay, later then!
TTW00007560	Okay. See you later, and don't get too bashed up.
TTW00007561	I understand. Well, take care.
TTW00007562	I hear that. Anyway, gotta be on my way. Later.
TTW00007563	Oh, okay. Umm, bye!
TTW00007564	Okay, whatever you say. Bye.
TTW00007565	All right then! See ya!
TTW00007566	Okay, then! See ya!
TTW00007567	That makes sense. Talk to you later.
TTW00007568	Fine. Bye now.
TTW00007569	Yeah, I see. Catch you later, I guess.
TTW00007570	Yeah, yeah, fine. Catch ya later.
TTW00007571	'Kay, bye.
TTW00007572	Okay. Bye.
TTW00007573	Meh.
TTW00007574	Busy, like always. Somebody's always got a tummy ache or a runny nose or a knife wound. You know how it is.
TTW00007575	I'm fine. It's another fine day, underground.
TTW00007576	Doing good. I could do with better food, but couldn't we all?
TTW00007577	I'm fine, thanks!
TTW00007578	Doing better than a dog in a bone-yard!
TTW00007579	Happier than a Ghoul wallowing in sludge!
TTW00007580	Just fine! Been all over today, and you wouldn't believe the cool stuff I did!
TTW00007581	It's always nicer to be in here than out there.
TTW00007582	I'm fine.
TTW00007583	I think I'm catching a cough. But I'll be fine.
TTW00007584	Oh, not yet I'm not.
TTW00007585	We're in the best fucking place in the world! You better believe I feel great!
TTW00007586	I'm okay!
TTW00007587	I'm okay.
TTW00007588	Oh hey! How're you doing? Doing okay?
TTW00007589	Hello. How are you doing?
TTW00007590	Hello. How's it going?
TTW00007591	Hey there! You doing alright?
TTW00007592	Hey! How's Lamplight life treating you?
TTW00007593	Heya. Are you feeling alright? You look a little stiff.
TTW00007594	Hello, there. Are you okay?
TTW00007595	Hey. How you doing?
TTW00007596	Hello. How are you?
TTW00007597	Hrmf. What're you so happy about?
TTW00007598	Beat it, squirt.
TTW00007599	How do, pal?
TTW00007600	How do ya do, pal?
TTW00007601	Hewwo. How're you?
TTW00007602	Hey, how are you?
TTW00007603	That's ridiculous. I'm not paying you that much!
TTW00007604	50 caps would still leave you with a nice profit. What do you say?
TTW00007605	All right. But don't let it get around, or I'll have every dirty waster begging me for help.
TTW00007606	Come on, doc. I need help. 75 caps is better than nothing, right?
TTW00007607	Fine. 100 it is. But don't think this makes us friends. This is a special, one-time offer, understand?
TTW00007608	That's highway robbery. 100 caps is more than fair, don't you think?
TTW00007609	All right, here's your caps.
TTW00007610	All right, here's your caps.
TTW00007611	All right, here's your caps.
TTW00007612	The code is 2-1-6.
TTW00007613	All right.
TTW00007614	I'll see you in hell, coward.
TTW00007615	Okay, I got it.
TTW00007616	I guess if this doesn't work, we're screwed anyway, right?
TTW00007617	Okay, I got it.
TTW00007618	I'll do it. I'll start the purifier.
TTW00007619	You're going to have to be quick about it. If the radiation is bad enough, you won't have much time.
TTW00007620	I won't forget what you've done here. No one will. Thank you.
TTW00007621	Didn't know it was him until I found that old book near him. No more killing. I just need to go. Can't forget the book. All I have left of him.
TTW00007622	Don't want to risk a shot at the crows until I know what’s in there. Sneaking in tonight.
TTW00007623	He must have been trying to trap food here. I recognize his snares. I can make out a building on the horizon. That must be where he headed.
TTW00007624	If not, at least I get a roof tonight.
TTW00007625	Hit a caravan today. Trev didn't see the kid and got popped. I took care of Tawny right then, and put one in Thor before he saw her fall.
TTW00007626	That earned me some grub from the traders. Even better, they saw dad. He was in pretty rough shape, and still has the goddamn book.
TTW00007627	Trader says it gave him the creeps. Me too. But it's good to know he's still alive. Still headed south.
TTW00007628	Gee, thanks! I have to admit, most of them aren't really funny. At least, not ha-ha funny.
TTW00007629	They're more like a tradition. Most of them were passed down from this book we found down back, called "Vault Boy's Big Book of Laughs for Kids".
TTW00007630	They're not really funny, but something about hearing them is a little comforting, you know?
TTW00007631	I know. And really, we're lucky we didn't lose more people in that attack.
TTW00007632	But we can't risk that a second time. I've got to stay extra vigilant on watch. Thanks for reminding me of that.
TTW00007633	Now leave me alone. No distractions!
TTW00007634	Sounds like it was your fault Caps died. Guards can't slack like that.
TTW00007635	Somebody needs to guard the front gate, and no one else is doing it. So I will. Even if it sucks for me, I don't mind.
TTW00007636	Some things just have to be done, and they just have to be done right. Because if they aren't, you can't ever get back what you lose.
TTW00007637	Besides, Caps would want it like that.
TTW00007638	You're going to stand guard all alone from now on? Quite a sacrifice, Stacey.
TTW00007639	No. Not anymore, they don't.
TTW00007640	Now, stop distracting me from my job.
TTW00007641	That's the way things go, you know?
TTW00007642	It really is my fault she died.
TTW00007643	Now I'm the only front gate guard, so it's my responsibility to make up for that.
TTW00007644	You can't blame yourself for her death.
TTW00007645	Oh, is that how it's going to be, then? Well then, how's this deal?
TTW00007646	Rather than you wasting the explosives to try to close all of our exits, just for us to burrow out again, you get my private stash of fungus. Here.
TTW00007647	But I wouldn't expect much goodwill in town after this, you shit-sucking mungo bastard.
TTW00007648	Give me the fungus, or I'll seal this place underground. And you with it.
TTW00007649	It's not that complex. Any kid can say they want to be mayor here. It's just that most don't want to bother with the responsibility of leading.
TTW00007650	Most of the time, they last until the kids get tired of them, then they get kicked out on their ass by the new mayor. One only lasted 5 minutes.
TTW00007651	Of course, I've kept this place going strong for three years. To most kids, that makes me Mayor For Fucking Life. Fine by me, I say.
TTW00007652	How did you get to be in charge of this place?
TTW00007653	Great stuff! Talk with you later, sis!
TTW00007654	Not if I could help it! Made any good trades today?
TTW00007655	You getting a nickname any time soon? Maybe you can get one that helps people figure out you're not a girl.
TTW00007656	Just like you're keeping them alive, Lucy. Here you go.
TTW00007657	Just like you're keeping them alive, Lucy. Here you go.
TTW00007658	Nice try, but you're still getting the same muck as everyone else.
TTW00007659	Here. Now, get.
TTW00007660	People don't have the same sort of safety and freedom to run around and play like you can here. They have to work hard for food and safety.
TTW00007661	Uncle Joseph, could you explain more about the outside?
TTW00007662	Uncle Joseph, I still don't understand what outside's like. Can you explain more?
TTW00007663	I have 20 to sell.
TTW00007664	We can always use 'em.
TTW00007665	I have 25 to sell.
TTW00007666	We can always use 'em.
TTW00007667	I have 15 to sell.
TTW00007668	We can always use 'em.
TTW00007669	I have 5 to sell.
TTW00007670	We can always use 'em.
TTW00007671	I have 10 to sell.
TTW00007672	We can always use 'em.
TTW00007673	Interested in buying some scrap metal?
TTW00007674	I sure am, sonny. What've you got for me?
TTW00007675	I sure am, missy. What've you got for me?
TTW00007676	What can I do to help around here?
TTW00007677	Well, it's no secret that the ol' water treatment plant is on its last legs. And I'm the only one in town that can keep the damn thing running.
TTW00007678	I spend so much time up in the plant, that I can't take care of the leaks that keep springing up in the pipes around town.
TTW00007679	Now, I don't expect much from strangers, but if you've got the know-how, I need someone to hunt down and repair those leaks.
TTW00007680	But listen, it's only a matter of time before they burst again, and someone like you might not be around to fix 'em. I'll make you a deal.
TTW00007681	I'll give you caps for any Scrap Metal you can bring me. You'll find it all over the place out there in the Wastes.
TTW00007682	If I have a steady supply of scrap, I can keep the plant running and the pipes should be just fine. We got a deal?
TTW00007683	The pipes are all fixed.
TTW00007684	Just take all the scrap metal I have. No charge. I just want to help.
TTW00007685	I'm not your errand boy. Just pay me for the repairs.
TTW00007686	But what do you care? You just want your money. Here, take it and get out.
TTW00007687	But what do you care? You just want your money. Here, take it and get out.
TTW00007688	I'm not your errand girl. Just pay me for the repairs.
TTW00007689	Tell you what. You tell me first, and I'll consider taking the tour.
TTW00007690	Well, I suppose. I really wanted you to see the tour, but you seem nice enough.
TTW00007691	Ever hear of Nuka-Cola Quantum?
TTW00007692	Anyone seen Forty? He wanted to talk to me.
TTW00007693	Pronto said he wanted to talk to me about something. Keep up, ladies.
TTW00007694	I need to see our good doctor.
TTW00007695	Let's leave our employees to their recreation. There's a business to run.
TTW00007696	Let's see what's going on over at the bar.
TTW00007697	Nothing going on here. Let's go.
TTW00007698	PFEulogyObserveStageStart
TTW00007699	I'm headed over to the block to see what's going on.
TTW00007700	Well, they haven't killed each other yet. Always a plus.
TTW00007701	C'mon. Time to check on the stock.
TTW00007702	Alright, I've had enough. Let's do something else.
TTW00007703	Let's go up top. I want to see what these fools are up to.
TTW00007704	Everyone calls me Zip, and I think that's because I'm always wearing pants, and those have zippers, but it's not like I'm the only one with pants.
TTW00007705	Here's all the Nuka-Cola Quantum I'm carrying.
TTW00007706	You've done it! My machine is finally full!
TTW00007707	Well, like I promised, here's the schematic for the Nuka Grenade. You've sure earned it!
TTW00007708	If you find any more bottles, be sure and bring them by. I'll be glad to keep paying for them.
TTW00007709	I have the last of the Quantum!
TTW00007710	You've done it! My machine is finally full!
TTW00007711	Well, like I promised, here's your surprise.... the schematic for the Nuka Grenade! You've sure earned it!
TTW00007712	If you find any more bottles, be sure and bring them by. I'll be glad to keep paying for them.
TTW00007713	I have the last of the Quantum!
TTW00007714	My machine's almost full you know. That's over 25 bottles of Quantum!
TTW00007715	Get me to 30 and you'll have the surprise reward I promised! Hehe! I love surprises!
TTW00007716	Over twenty bottles already? Incredible! Keep 'em coming!
TTW00007717	Oh my word! Do you realize you've brought me back over ten of the Nuka-Cola Quantums?
TTW00007718	I knew you were the right person for the job.
TTW00007719	Wow. I can't believe you've found over five of the Quantums. I've never even seen that many before. Good job!
TTW00007720	Yay! I knew I could count on you! I promise to put them to good use.
TTW00007721	Won't be long before I'm ready to spring my surprise on Sierra. She's gonna give it up for me for certain for this. Heck, she'd better!
TTW00007722	I'm glad you're seeing things my way. Nice job.
TTW00007723	More, huh? Good. This will make Sierra very happy.
TTW00007724	Keep the bottles coming, I'll keep the caps flowing.
TTW00007725	Come on, Sierra. No secrets between friends! What's the special reward?
TTW00007726	I don't know a whole lot about weapons, but I do know that it's more powerful than a regular grenade.
TTW00007727	It explodes in a huge blue flame too! How cool is that?
TTW00007728	Tell me more about the Nuka Cocktail.
TTW00007729	What do you know about the Nuka-Cola Bottling Facility?
TTW00007730	This facility is a stunning accomplishment by the creative minds at the Nuka-Cola Corporation.
TTW00007731	We use cutting edge equipment to keep the world's most popular soft drink in full production 24 hours a day.
TTW00007732	This unit prides itself on over 457 days without a single death or major limb loss of any personnel.
TTW00007733	What do you know about Nuka-Cola Quantum?
TTW00007734	This product is the pinnacle of taste sensation.
TTW00007735	Seventeen fruit flavors and that signature cola taste blend to form the perfect refreshing soft drink.
TTW00007736	With its new Strontium additive, its got that unique kick to keep you on your toes.
TTW00007737	Do you even have a clue as to where I can start looking?
TTW00007738	In fact, I do! Ha! Surprised you didn't I?
TTW00007739	Your best bet would be to find the ruins of the D.C. Nuka-Cola Bottling Facility. Find the shipping manifests inside.
TTW00007740	With them in hand, you should have a good clue as to where the Quantum was delivered.
TTW00007741	While you're there, you may even be able to find some bottles of Quantum!
TTW00007742	Oh, what happened to you, dear?
TTW00007743	Poor kid, just be careful from now on, okay?
TTW00007744	Come here, I'll make it all better.
TTW00007745	What have you got to trade for a bottle of Nuka-Cola?
TTW00007746	Oh, I found a lucky bullet this morning!
TTW00007747	It's just a measly old 10 mil, but I know for sure it's lucky, 'cause it was sitting there all alone out of its clip and not fired off. Want it?
TTW00007748	I got an old mag full of 5.56s! Is that good enough for you?
TTW00007749	Last time I was out looking, I found some of this mutfruit. It's not as sweet as Nuka, but maybe you mungos like that sort of thing?
TTW00007750	Well, I've got these pills that say "Mentats", but Lucy says they taste yucky and that I shouldn't take them. Maybe you want them?
TTW00007751	Well, I didn't want to trade it, but I've got a stimpak Lucy said I'm supposed to carry around with me. Is it worth a Nuka?
TTW00007752	Oh, check this out, it's my most, most prized possession I found! Squirrel says it's a micro fusion cell. Is it worth a Nuka?
TTW00007753	Yeah, and I got lots to trade. But if you got no Nuka, you're not getting nothing, no way!
TTW00007754	You said you were looking for Nuka-Cola?
TTW00007755	Yeah, more Nuka's always good! It's definitely always gooder than less, because no Nuka's no good at all! Got any Nuka for me?
TTW00007756	I'll trade you whatever I've got for more Nuka-Cola! Anytime! Nuka 4 Zip! Nuka 4 Zip!
TTW00007757	You said you were looking for Nuka-Cola?
TTW00007758	That's all I got right now. Come back tomorrow, maybe I'll have more, and you can have more Nuka for me to have more Nuka? Yeah?
TTW00007759	Got anything else for a Nuka-Cola?
TTW00007760	I did yesterday, I am today, and I probably will be tomorrow! Well, unless I die from too much Nuka. But that can't happen. Everyone knows that!
TTW00007761	Are you still offering a trade for Nuka-Cola?
TTW00007762	Stand down, squishy. Present your ID on the double.
TTW00007763	ID accepted. Resume your duties.
TTW00007764	Halt, intruder! Unauthorized personnel will be handled with extreme violence.
TTW00007765	Initiating Combat Protocol: Charlie Zulu 4.
TTW00007766	I need to you repair my weapons.
TTW00007767	Yeah, lemme see what you have.
TTW00007768	Let me see your inventory.
TTW00007769	I tell you, for a bunch of dumbass wasters, the boys pull some good stuff off of the new meat.
TTW00007770	I want to buy medical supplies.
TTW00007771	Money first, then you'll get the goods.
TTW00007772	Paradise Falls? What's that?
TTW00007773	Are you kidding me? You've never heard of Paradise Falls? Oh, right. The suit. You're right out of the vault, aren't you? Great.
TTW00007774	Shit, you're lucky you're not up there in the pens, dumbass. I can't believe you. Anyway, Paradise Falls is home to the Slavers.
TTW00007775	Up there, we sell the slaves that we capture out in the Wastes. So, unless you're either buying or selling, piss off.
TTW00007776	You think I didn't know that? I've been hiding in this place for days!
TTW00007777	There's an old portashelter next to the diner near my house. Those stupid things will never get me in there.
TTW00007778	I'll head over there and wait inside. Hurry back!
TTW00007779	In fifteen feet, make a right turn.
TTW00007780	The left path is the right path, if you get my meaning.
TTW00007781	Keep it up. You're almost here.

TTW00007799	I'm sorry. The name's Reilly. Yeah, THE Reilly as in Reilly's Rangers.
TTW00007800	I'm not going to bug you anymore.
TTW00007801	If time wasn't so precious right now, I wouldn't be so on edge either. I need to get help for the rest of the Rangers, and fast.
TTW00007802	Sorry about being such a jerk, Reilly.
TTW00007803	If time wasn't so precious right now, I wouldn't be so on edge either. I need to get help for the rest of the Rangers, and fast.
TTW00007804	I got your friends back. Can I come in now?
TTW00007805	I guess you're okay after all, mungo.
TTW00007806	You can come in, but you better not piss me off.
TTW00007807	Oh, I don't know if I told you yet, but I just remembered something really cool!
TTW00007808	And guess what?
TTW00007809	Yeah, fine, just remember next time, okay?
TTW00007810	Yes, sir!
TTW00007811	He's not your uncle, Bumble!
TTW00007812	Here's food, Princess.

TTW00007817	As long as you don't mind cooking it yourself.
TTW00007818	Sure. You may want to grill it up sooner rather than later, if you know what I mean.
TTW00007819	As long as you aren't a vegetarian.
TTW00007820	Yeah. Of course. With Megaton gone, it's hard to make an honest living these days.
TTW00007821	Ah, got a taste for it, now, do you?
TTW00007822	Take a look. It's always fresh.
TTW00007823	What's mine is yours, friend.
TTW00007824	I may be able to help, but it will cost you.
TTW00007825	Our names will be in the history books for such a feat of scientific brilliance! How marvelous!
TTW00007826	Are you aware your new ants breathe fire?!
TTW00007827	Well, this is rather embarrassing so you'll have to forgive me, but it appears that I've made a slight miscalculation in my mutagen samples.
TTW00007828	Instead of lowering the size of the ants, the brood hatched and developed a new biomechanism.
TTW00007829	I call their genetic aberration pyrosis; the ability to emit flame from their bodies.

TTW00007837	And when the time comes, you'll grow up and leave Lamplight and meet me in Big Town, too. It won't be that long, I promise.
TTW00007838	And when I grow up, I can come join you there, too!
TTW00007839	Yeah, you'll be better off staying at home.
TTW00007840	I guess this is goodbye then. Come back and visit me.
TTW00007841	I can't leave you here alone. Let me find you a place to live.
TTW00007842	Really? You mean it!?
TTW00007843	Just don't forget about me!
TTW00007844	Really? You mean it!?
TTW00007845	Oh boy! Thank you so much! I'll wait in my old house for you to come back.
TTW00007846	Just don't forget about me!
TTW00007847	Authorized ticketholders, please proceed to the main platform.
TTW00007848	Thanks! Nuka for me!
TTW00007849	Sounds like a good trade to me. Here.
TTW00007850	Hooray! I win the Nuka-Cola game! What's the prize? Nuka-Cola!
TTW00007851	Sounds like a good trade to me. Here.
TTW00007852	Yay! Nuka-Cola, Nuka-Cola, makes a stomach bubbly and the world so jumbly, yay!
TTW00007853	Sounds like a good trade to me. Here.
TTW00007854	She used to take care of me. She liked my company guarding. She liked it when I used to tell jokes.
TTW00007855	Then, some Raiders attacked. And I was the only guard left.
TTW00007856	You said you used to have another guard. What happened?
TTW00007857	We don't use it much. We don't let many visitors in, and the scav teams usually use crawlspace exits to the surface, so they can't be followed.
TTW00007858	The only times this gate opens is when we've got big cargo to bring in or if we're letting in a mungo. Neither happens often.
TTW00007859	Why aren't there more guards here?
TTW00007860	We usually use crawlspaces so mungos can't follow. This gate doesn't get used much, except letting in big cargo or mungos. Both are rare.
TTW00007861	We used to have two guards here, but we can make do with one, as long as I'm vigilant. We don't have much choice.
TTW00007862	Why aren't there more guards here?
TTW00007863	Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, Red. Super fine. Super duper fine. That Wastelander saved me!
TTW00007864	Yeah, so did I! You ever think about helping me! Huh!? Asshole!
TTW00007865	I'm having a great time, here, Timebomb. But is everyone always this glum?
TTW00007866	Great, Red. Hey, can I stop by the clinic later? I wanted your help picking my new nickname. You know, for Big Town.
TTW00007867	Come on, Flash. I'm not a little kid anymore. You can stop calling me Sticky.
TTW00007868	Aww, quit it. I'm not a kid anymore! Call me by my real name, would ya?
TTW00007869	Well, you could help ME by resetting the barricades.
TTW00007870	The alignments are all wrong, the walls are too short, and you're stupid-looking.
TTW00007871	Why? Because I'm short? Who are you calling short!?
TTW00007872	Little? Who you calling little! I was running this town long before you guys showed up!
TTW00007873	That sounds fine, Timebomb. Just take it easy when I bring out the surgical tools. I've never heard anyone scream that loud before.
TTW00007874	Not right now, Sticky. I'm a little busy. Can we talk later?
TTW00007875	I'm not sure everyone would agree with you, Shorty. And besides, don't you think the barricades are high enough for you?
TTW00007876	No thanks, Kimba. Could you check in on Pappy, though? He's about as happy as a dead Brahmin lately.
TTW00007877	Pappy, I told you last time and the time before that. It's a scratch. You're not going to die.
TTW00007878	That takes forever, Shorty. Several hours at least.
TTW00007879	I swear it's infected, Red. I think you might need to amputate.
TTW00007880	Do you know how to use it?
TTW00007881	Everyone eventually finds their place in town, Sticky. Don't worry about it.
TTW00007882	Shorty, you were never mayor, remember? The other kids would just pick you up and throw you.
TTW00007883	That's great, Flash. Amazing how you could do that with only 10 bullets.
TTW00007884	Hey, Pappy.
TTW00007885	A one-half mile radius? What does that even mean?
TTW00007886	Maybe they'll be scared off by your makeup first.
TTW00007887	Me and my new gun haven't seen anything, Pappy.
TTW00007888	Eh. You people and your demands. "Pay attention on patrol. Set up the barricades. Stop sleeping during your patrol!"
TTW00007889	You better get started then. Hurry up! I don't like to wait.
TTW00007890	What are you implying?
TTW00007891	Oh, some other time Sticky. I have plans tonight. How about tomorrow?
TTW00007892	The barricades should be fine, for now.
TTW00007893	You don't seem to understand. This gun is bad-ass. Yeah!
TTW00007894	Well, I still think it looks pretty bad.
TTW00007895	That’s funny, I thought we were an autonomous collective.
TTW00007896	Oh, that? Come on Red, Pappy's never been happy.
TTW00007897	You're damn right you do! 'Cause I'm the only one who can really keep this town safe.
TTW00007898	Well, Pappy, when the arm falls off and you're rolling on the ground in agony, I'll come take a look at it.
TTW00007899	That just means they're getting ready. They'll come for us, I know it.
TTW00007900	I'm sorry, Pappy, but what else can we do? I miss Lamplight.
TTW00007901	I don't know, Pappy. I just don't know.
TTW00007902	That's, um, that's great Timebomb. Well, I'm glad you're all right.
TTW00007903	Whoa, whoa. Calm down. Never mind.
TTW00007904	Only your complete and utter lack of importance.
TTW00007905	Jerk. I'm glad we broke up.
TTW00007906	Ha! I think I will. And that is why you are the best boy a Slaver could ever ask for.
TTW00007907	What is it, my boy?
TTW00007908	I swear, boy, you are going to be the greatest Slaver that ever lived!
TTW00007909	It's just that if you're bored all the time, you're not appreciating how good we have it.
TTW00007910	Yes, daddy. I'm sorry, daddy.
TTW00007911	Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
TTW00007912	Nah. I know you run your shit straight. Keep up the good work.
TTW00007913	Ahh, doc. You keep us walking around and making money. That's why we keep you around.
TTW00007914	Keep running your mouth, Crimson. That's why he don't like you no more.
TTW00007915	Hrmph. It's not my fault that I'm the favorite. You don't need to be so bitter.
TTW00007916	Why do you always have to try to prove something to me? Do you think I care who Eulogy likes better? Seriously?
TTW00007917	Clover, I will smack the shit out of you. Can't you just shut up and leave me alone?
TTW00007918	<sigh> I'm sorry.
TTW00007919	<grumble> Sorry, Eulogy.
TTW00007920	Why do you have to be like that? I'm just trying to talk to you and you have to come at me with that shit?
TTW00007921	See? This is what I mean. But you know what they say about mean women? Sooner or later, someone will accidentally shoot them while on a mission.
TTW00007922	Why are you always so mean? All I ever am is nice to you, but it's always "Ymir go away, you smell" or "Ymir, get me a drink and then go away".
TTW00007923	Good, Bronson. Don't let me down.
TTW00007924	Alright, Bronson. No screw ups this time, got it?
TTW00007925	I've been alive far too long to let some crazy plan get my head blown off. It ain't a bad life, you know. One you get used to it.
TTW00007926	Sorry, I'm not interested in your offer.
TTW00007927	Oh, and I wouldn't bother running back to Sierra and warning her. She won't even understand what you're talking about.
TTW00007928	She may be a hottie, but she's a bit vacant in the smarts department.
TTW00007929	Yeah, sure. I'm always for making more caps.
TTW00007930	Thought you might. Good. I'll see you soon then.
TTW00007931	I don't have time for this nonsense.
TTW00007932	All right, suit yourself.
TTW00007933	Not bad, man. Not bad at all.
TTW00007934	Swell.
TTW00007935	Peachy.
TTW00007936	Get the fuck away from me, meat.
TTW00007937	Hahahaha! Yeah, right.
TTW00007938	Oh, please. Kid, come back after your balls have dropped.
TTW00007939	Hello yourself.
TTW00007940	Keep walkin', boy.
TTW00007941	<grunts>
TTW00007942	Hello there, little man.
TTW00007943	Hello there, pretty girl.
TTW00007944	Hey.
TTW00007945	Look, you rotting piece of shit! Tell me what you know or it's splatter time!
TTW00007946	All right! I'll tell you! Please, just don't hurt me!
TTW00007947	Moriarty keeps a computer terminal in the back. On it, he keeps all of the dirty secrets of Megaton.
TTW00007948	If you can get onto that terminal, I bet he has information on your Dad.
TTW00007949	Now, get away from me, smoothskin. If Moriarty even suspects I told you this, I'm a dead Ghoul.
TTW00007950	If you know anyone else that can help, I'd appreciate it.
TTW00007951	Moriarty is your best bet. I wish you luck. Now, I have to get back to work, or I'll be answering to him too.
TTW00007952	Gob, please. If you know anything about my father, you need to tell me.
TTW00007953	I was like you once. I wandered into town looking for an escape from this stupid joke of a body I'm trapped in. Now look at me.
TTW00007954	Very well. Moriarty keeps a computer terminal in the back. On it, he keeps all of the goings on in Megaton.
TTW00007955	If you can get onto that terminal, I bet he has information on your Dad.
TTW00007956	Now, get away from me, smoothskin. If Moriarty even suspects I told you this, I'm a dead Ghoul.
TTW00007957	Look, if you know something, you'd better tell me!
TTW00007958	Look, smoothskin. I've told you all I dare. Moriarty doesn't like me chatting with the customers like this.
TTW00007959	If he even thought I was talking to you, he'd tan my hide!
TTW00007960	Let me get back to work now before he sees us.
TTW00007961	I talked to Moriarty already and he's trying to charge me for the info.
TTW00007962	Sigh. That's his way. Always putting caps before people's lives.
TTW00007963	I'm sorry, I really must get back to work. I can't get involved. I'm so sorry.
TTW00007964	Sounds good to me.
TTW00007965	Well then, let's make a deal!
TTW00007966	Finally! Let's get down to business.
TTW00007967	I complained off hand one day about how I thought that heap of metal on the horizon was a bit of an eyesore. Mister Burke offered to take care of it.
TTW00007968	Burke is such an agreeable man, isn't he? I don't know how I got along without him. I practically don't have to think about things anymore.
TTW00007969	He takes care of everything. I seldom even have to ask. He's a real go-getter, that one. We need more men like him if we're going to rebuild the world.
TTW00007970	What are you shooting at out there?
TTW00007971	I'm heading to the Vault now. I'll do whatever I can to get inside. My number of the passcode was "7," right?
TTW00007972	Before they took him into custody, Alex he sent each of us one number of the four-digit code. That way, we all have to be together to get in.
TTW00007973	Oh, and I'm not pregnant. So no worries.
TTW00007974	Tina, it's me. Your brother? Alex? Listen, mom would kill me if she knew I was contacting you, but she's being an impossible bitch right now.
TTW00007975	Look, no matter what it takes, the whole damn Keller family's gonna ride this storm out, but you've got to get your ass home. Now!
TTW00007976	He gave me this Fusion Pulse Charge to rig to the bomb. Here, take it.
TTW00007977	Jesus! Gimme that thing!
TTW00007978	Let's go find this Burke character. You're about to get an education in Wasteland justice.
TTW00007979	Jesus! Gimme that thing!
TTW00007980	Thanks. If Burke steps within a mile of Megaton, he's a dead man.
TTW00007981	What if he asks someone else to explode the bomb? You should do something.
TTW00007982	Good point. Come with me. You're about to get an education in Wasteland justice.
TTW00007983	He's long gone by now. But I swear: If he steps within a mile of Megaton, he's a fucking dead man.
TTW00007984	Too many lives are at stake, Burke! I'm going to defuse that bomb.
TTW00007985	All right. Say I decide to help you. What's in it for me?
TTW00007986	You mean besides doing the world a favor by removing this pestilent scab of a town?
TTW00007987	Why, you'd be rewarded most handsomely! My employer is a very generous man. If it's bottle caps and luxury you're seeking. You shall have it!
TTW00007988	Take the Fusion Pulse Charge. Place it into the bomb. Then meet me at Tenpenny Tower. There I will show you what true power is.
TTW00007989	I can see about disarming that bomb for you.
TTW00007990	Oh, all right. Fine. But listen here. Just take a look at it first. Go easy.
TTW00007991	If you get the job done, there'll be 100 caps in it for you.
TTW00007992	Well I'll be damned. You're from that vault! Vault 101! Ha ha! I ain't seen one of those jumpsuits in a LONG time!
TTW00007993	Yoohoo! Yao Guai! C'mon out!
TTW00007994	How did you know I was looking for my Dad?
TTW00007995	Oh come on. You're a spitting image of the guy. He's been here before, and now you're here. Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.
TTW00007996	You want to find your dad, and it just so happens his location is known to yours truly.
TTW00007997	But if you want to know more, you're going to have to contribute to the Good Fight.
TTW00007998	So you fight the Good Fight with your voice on Galaxy News Radio.
TTW00007999	Well, holy shit! Aren't you a chip off the old block? You ARE as smart as your dad.
TTW00008000	Since you know all about this cause, no need to explain the effect. Let's get you on your way.
TTW00008001	The Good Fight? What's that all about?
TTW00008002	Imagine a picture, okay? A picture of the Capital Wasteland. All that brick and rock. A whole lot of nothing, right?
TTW00008003	There's people out there trying to just barely make it from day to day. Fighting to stay alive and make something out of what they got.
TTW00008004	What's this book you're working on?
TTW00008005	Oh, sure. I mean, if you're going to be my assistant, it's in my best interest that you stay alive, right?
TTW00008006	Besides, I guess the original owner isn't coming back to pick it up, so you're the closest thing to an inheritor. Here!
TTW00008007	Can I have that Armored Vault Suit?
TTW00008008	I said: Are you all right?
TTW00008009	Oh, I don't know. I don't wear a watch, they're pretty rare you know. Ask someone else.
TTW00008010	What are you looking at?
TTW00008011	I'm watching the patrols, what do you think I'm looking at?
TTW00008012	They switch it up a little bit every day, but just a little. There has to be some sort of pattern to it, it's just a matter of watching and waiting.
TTW00008013	I've brought some bloodpacks to contribute.
TTW00008014	I can only offer my thanks. My people are getting accustomed to using these as a substitute for live prey.
TTW00008015	As compensation for your effort, allow me to at least give you something in return.
TTW00008016	Again, many thanks. Here is your compensation.
TTW00008017	Ha! Figures a shithole like this would have a local Chem head.
TTW00008018	A place like this is probably crawling with junkies, huh?
TTW00008019	Megaton might not be Tenpenny Tower, but that doesn't make breaking patient-doctor confidentiality any more ethical, now does it?
TTW00008020	So you've got someone in town with a drug habit?
TTW00008021	I'm afraid that goes against patient-doctor confidentiality.
TTW00008022	I heard tell of a scavenger tried that up Canterbury way. They found his body a week later, scorched with plasma bolts.
TTW00008023	I don't know, but I'd stay away from it. No telling what those Enclave types will get up to next.
TTW00008024	Me neither. I like the music, though. Kind of nice to hear something more cheerful than what those hippies on GNR always play.
TTW00008025	Finding a crew might be tough. Good luck, though.
TTW00008026	You've made a grievous error in judgement. Watch your back.
TTW00008027	<grumble>
TTW00008028	You've either got a death wish, or a pair of stones bigger than hand grenades.
TTW00008029	Say, you seem to have some smarts in you, and with your sort of guts, maybe you can help us out. Interested in collecting technology for us?
TTW00008030	You've got a laser. Technically, you'd be asking "with highly focused light."
TTW00008031	<grumble>
TTW00008032	You've either got a death wish, or the biggest pair of stones ever sported by a woman.
TTW00008033	Say, you seem to have some smarts in you, and with your sort of guts, maybe you can help us out. Interested in collecting technology for us?
TTW00008034	You've got a laser. Technically, you'd be asking "with highly focused light."
TTW00008035	You know my father? Have you seen him?
TTW00008036	Well yes, of course I do. Don't you know who I am? I suppose James never told you. Typical.
TTW00008037	I'm Doctor Madison Li. I worked with your father many years ago. Your mother as well, in fact.
TTW00008038	You'll have to forgive me. This has all been very stressful, what with your father suddenly showing up here after being gone for so long.
TTW00008039	Why is Moriarty so hard on him?
TTW00008040	Well, the miserable bastard is hard on all of us. But Gob gets it the worst. I guess just because he's different, you know?
TTW00008041	I don't want to sound shallow or anything, I mean, I'm a whore, my standards aren't exactly high.
TTW00008042	But there are places even I won't go. Johnnies that are squishier than me are one of 'em.
TTW00008043	Where did he come from?
TTW00008044	He don't talk about it much but apparently, there's a whole city of Ghouls somewhere down in D.C.
TTW00008045	He's mentioned his mother a couple of times, but other than that, he won't really say.
TTW00008046	What were you saying about radio stations?
TTW00008047	Huh? Oh, you mean why was Gob banging on that radio? Well, out there in the Wastes, there are two stations that broadcast.
TTW00008048	There's the Enclave station. I don't know who they are, but I think it might just be some Pre-War broadcast on a loop or something.
TTW00008049	And there's Galaxy News Radio. It's run by a guy named Three Dog somewhere down in D.C. But the signal went down a while ago.
TTW00008050	What's the story with that Ghoul?
TTW00008051	Who, Gob? Well, if you can get past how he looks, he's a sweetheart. Colin's awfully hard on him, though.
TTW00008052	Everything's just fabulous!
TTW00008053	What's the point? Besides, I hate all that cold metal touching my skin. It gives me the willies! So, I'll just stick with visiting when I get sick.
TTW00008054	Fabulous! Can I sell you a pair of sport shoes? Maybe they'd help you catch your wife when she runs away from you!
TTW00008055	And I've got a little number in my shop that should help push up those sagging girls of yours, darling.
TTW00008056	What the hell are you talking about?!
TTW00008057	Come on man. Quit it already! I'm not interested!
TTW00008058	You're not very subtle, you know.
TTW00008059	What?! Are you kidding? I'm too fabulous to settle down.
TTW00008060	That's right. And the safety's off. Back off.
TTW00008061	Same old shit. See something big and ugly moving in the distance. Shoot the hell out of it. Go an' check to make sure it's dead. Rinse and repeat.
TTW00008062	I can assure you, Mr. Wellington, we're not just sunning ourselves out there all day. That's for damn sure!
TTW00008063	Hah! I'm fine with the same old shit all the time. The day something "interesting" happens in the Wasteland, it's time to retire!
TTW00008064	Everything is under control, Ms. Montenegro.
TTW00008065	You're pressing your luck, Hawthorne.
TTW00008066	I'll be sure to discuss it with them Mrs. Wellington.
TTW00008067	Hello Ms. Lancaster.
TTW00008068	I'm afraid not, Ms. Cheng.
TTW00008069	Right. Sure thing, Anthony.
TTW00008070	Everythings fine, Chief. Thanks for keeping us safe.
TTW00008071	Surgery of any kind is always extremely dangerous. The risk of infection is great. A doctor should never cut open a patient unless it's necessary.
TTW00008072	Yes. They are a fine addition. Now, if we can only get the residents to start eating them!
TTW00008073	I'm worried about you, Mrs. Cheng. Come by the Wellness Center, I might have a pill or two that'll help you relax and cope with things.
TTW00008074	Fine, thank you. You and your men patrolling makes everyone feel safe here. Thanks again.
TTW00008075	Haha! Nothing you can pin on me, Chief! But shouldn't you be out killing things in the Wasteland instead of pestering old harmless fogies like me?
TTW00008076	My dear boy. You've got all the adventure you need, right here in these four walls. For starters, you can figure out how to make your wife happy.
TTW00008077	It's a radio play, not a documentary.
TTW00008078	Let's you and I stick to finding trouble to get into here, before we rush out in the Wasteland again; I'll take Gustavo over a Behemoth any day.
TTW00008079	Now there's an interesting idea, Mrs. Cheng!
TTW00008080	I wouldn't know. She's avoiding me lately.
TTW00008081	No worries, Comrade. Everyone else has trouble making the meetings, too. When I get my computer working, I'll get you a copy of the minutes.
TTW00008082	<Sigh.> I don't know what to do, Comrade. Every day I fix it, but it always breaks again.
TTW00008083	I shouldn't. A good leader, leads by example. But thank you anyway.
TTW00008084	Right, Susan. Whatever you say.
TTW00008085	Oh. Okay, dear. Goodbye.
TTW00008086	We all feel safe knowing you and your men have this place locked up tight. Thank you!
TTW00008087	I don't scrounge for anything. I run a high class Boutique, doctor, as you know. However, I can check with my supplier about holodisks for you.
TTW00008088	Thank you!
TTW00008089	Don't worry about them. Just be yourself dear. You've had a hard life. You deserve some happiness. Hell, we all do.
TTW00008090	What a question! I don't know. I supposed it is. But, it can't always be helped. We can't help who we fall in love with, can we?
TTW00008091	Raiders? Again? Well, I'll have to make do. Thank you for the heads up, Chief. And thank your men for us. We are all grateful of your presence here.
TTW00008092	Shoo! Away with you. Leave me alone!
TTW00008093	It's okay, really. I prefer to stay busy.
TTW00008094	Really? He orders that every day. I prefer making more creative dishes. Choose something else, I beg you!
TTW00008095	A sophisticated lady like you slaving over the stove? Don't trouble yourself with that, dear. You kick back and enjoy. I'm here to cook for you.
TTW00008096	Sure! I could always use another pair of hands in the kitchen.
TTW00008097	Oh that? It was nothing. A one time indiscretion, I assure you. Won't happen again, ol' chap. Scouts honor and all that. Care for a drink?
TTW00008098	What? Very funny old man! Well, I hear she's also running low on dried up old raisins, you cheeky bastard! Leave a gent to his drink already!
TTW00008099	Indeed! I'll drink to that!
TTW00008100	Amen. I'll drink to that sister. Cheers!
TTW00008101	Why do you think I spend so much time getting smashed in the lounge?
TTW00008102	Indeed, Mrs. Cheng. Indeed! Sometimes it helps wash away a lot more than just one day.
TTW00008103	Thank you for looking into that situation for me. I'm embarrassed it turned out to be nothing. Well, one can never be too careful.
TTW00008104	Why thank you, dear! How charming of you to say so. Perhaps you and I should start spending some time together? Eh? Ahahah.
TTW00008105	It hasn't been that long since my last "check up." So you know EXACTLY how I'm feeling, doctor.
TTW00008106	Nonsense Edgar! I always find your manners to be quite "up to the task." if you know what I mean! He he he he. See you later, MISTER Wellington.
TTW00008107	Eww! Banish the thought, old man! Seriously though, if you're still around in a decade or two, I might take you up on the offer.
TTW00008108	Why do I intimidate you so? You weren't intimated the other night! Aha! See you around, Don Juan.
TTW00008109	Don't they all, dear? Don't they all!
TTW00008110	What? Are you kidding me?! Mind your own damn business. I don't go turning lights on in your closet, do I? Jeez!
TTW00008111	I'm just great, if you don't count the fact that I'm married to the biggest idiot on the planet!
TTW00008112	If you mean day dreaming about killing Mr. Cheng and knocking a few back in the lounge, then yeah, I'm able to relax once in a while.
TTW00008113	It breaks all the time! Does he take that as a sign to spend time with me? No. Stupid man! He spends hours retyping everything. He's such a loser!
TTW00008114	What?!
TTW00008115	Cheers.
TTW00008116	I'd be happy to have you help sometime, Mrs. Cheng. Cooking can be very therapeutic.
TTW00008117	I hate that stupid man.
TTW00008118	Who you calling frumpy?! At least my ass isn't shaped like a pear.
TTW00008119	The usual, dear. And please, be sure to remember to measure the salt precisely. We don't a repeat of last weeks debacle.
TTW00008120	Yes! But the key to being fabulous, is that it comes from within. What you wear is only half the equation. BELIEVE you ARE already fabulous!
TTW00008121	Whatever, you old hag. I'm just swelling with fabulous.
TTW00008122	Those things are so tacky. How about you swing by New Urban Apparel, and I fit you into a cute Sunday dress? You need to spruce up your look dear.
TTW00008123	Of course! Shopping is wonderful therapy, isn't it? Better than any old pill Doc Banfield prescribes.
TTW00008124	I'm sorry? What?!
TTW00008125	Thank you for your concern, Doctor. But things've been tense is all, and my men are just blowing off steam. Don't worry. They'll be fine.
TTW00008126	And I envy your retirement, Dashwood. Though it's true. There's something satisfying about bagging a Rad-Scorpion at 100 yards with a single shot.
TTW00008127	Cheng. Damn it. Call me "Chief." Chief Gustavo! All that "comrade" nonsense is really getting on my nerves.
TTW00008128	That's kind of you, Ms. Primrose. But it's better if they don't cozy up with the residents. Helps retain discipline and remind them why they're here.
TTW00008129	I'm on duty. You alright Hawthorne? Don't want a repeat of that little stunt you pulled.
TTW00008130	Ms. Lancaster.
TTW00008131	I'd have to say that would be extremely unlikely, Mrs. Cheng.
TTW00008132	I'm afraid the lab coat never goes out of style for me. But I appreciate your concern.
TTW00008133	Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about. Though, it's been awhile since I've seen you. We should schedule a checkup soon.
TTW00008134	Absolutely not. All Wasteland meat MUST be thoroughly cooked. Disease and parasites are killed by the heat. I'm surprised I have to tell you this.
TTW00008135	Ahem. Yes. It has been too long since you've been properly examined.
TTW00008136	Why? Has someone been poisoned?!
TTW00008137	I know a little bit about technology. I've picked up a few tricks in my adventures. Why, what seems to be the problem?
TTW00008138	Hawthorne. Go easy on those remaining brain cells, alright?
TTW00008139	You should count yourself very lucky. I do. Most people die a horrible death out there in the Wastes. Excitement and danger often go hand in hand.
TTW00008140	Well, Comrade. My computer keeps breaking, and I have to start over each day. Not to worry though. I've got it practically memorized by now!
TTW00008141	Because, while it's true, some of us are better suited to lead the community, by calling you all comrades, I'm helping you not feel envy or sadness.
TTW00008142	Um. Hi.
TTW00008143	Antique shop? Really, Anthony, you need some new material! And I'm not just talking about your jokes either, darling. Those threads are atrocious!
TTW00008144	Yeah, I pop a couple, then have a Martini. Does wonders. Thanks Doc.
TTW00008145	Mr. Cheng. Shouldn't YOU know what your wife would like? Why don't you go find out what she wants, and I'll see about ordering it for you.
TTW00008146	Let's just say it's high time for a glass of wine. Putting on a happy face for all my customers all the time can be a bit tiresome.
TTW00008147	Yes, Mrs. Cheng. It's not easy though, is it?
TTW00008148	Thank you for saying so, sir. It's always my great pleasure. If you'd ever like to try another dish, I have an extensive menu of delicacies.
TTW00008149	Things are alright, I guess. I'm thinking I should stop by sometime and get some new clothes. I just can't seem to find the time.
TTW00008150	Nonsense. I'm fine. I enjoy making food and keeping the residents happy. A vacation from this would only make me anxious.
TTW00008151	Oh, I'm alright, I suppose. Though, apparently raiders have been attacking the caravans again. Missed a shipment. I'll just have to be creative!
TTW00008152	Thank you for saying so! It's always been my dream to own my own restaurant. Supplies have been running low, but it just makes me more creative!
TTW00008153	Thank you. It's always my pleasure to serve you Mr. Cheng. If you'd like, I could prepare a special candle light dinner for you and Mrs. Cheng.
TTW00008154	Yes, well. There've been shortages of certain things, so I've had to get creative. I hope everything is to your liking Ms. Montenegro.
TTW00008155	Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Besides, if I didn't cook for all of you, you'd starve to death! Heaven knows none of you can fend for yourselves!
TTW00008156	Why, yes. I believe so. Fairly happy, anyway. I really enjoy what I do. Cooking and preparing meals for the residents makes me happy.
TTW00008157	What? Oh right. Hah! That's a good one, Daring. I'm fine really. I've been drinking since I was a toddler. I can hold my liquor. What's new with you?
TTW00008158	My secret to what? Oh right. The ladies. Always start off with a few drinks to loosen up, then move onto the hard liquor to get the party rolling!
TTW00008159	Indeed! And at the beginning of a long day! Though, I prefer the stiffer stuff myself. So how're you holding up these days? How's that shop of yours?
TTW00008160	I wouldn't pay you so much to hang out with me if I thought you were ugly! I'm just kidding. Stop fishing for compliments. You know you're beautiful.
TTW00008161	Just goes to show you: It's always darker on the other side of the fence.
TTW00008162	EDGAR! I do believe you are trying to shake me off! The fire has finally died away, has it, Edgar? You fancy someone else these days, do you?
TTW00008163	Why thank you Allistair love. Er, I mean: MISTER Tenpenny!
TTW00008164	Doctor Banfield! Have you lost your appointment book? I thought we've made a regular appointment. A "house call" I do believe!
TTW00008165	Yes Edgar dear, I'm quite fine. Thanks for asking! Maybe I'll "see you" around later, then? When you get out for an "evening stroll," perhaps?
TTW00008166	Whatever. I know your type, Daring. You want me all to yourself. Well, I'm not some trophy animal you can just bag and hang on your wall!
TTW00008167	Don't be scared Irving, dear! I won't bite. Well, not unless you ask me to! Hahahaha!
TTW00008168	Don't be silly, Michael. It's because you pay me to be nice to you!
TTW00008169	Why? You haven't seen him have you?!
TTW00008170	Ha! Well, doc. If you got a pill that will make my husband disappear, I'll gladly take it.
TTW00008171	Yeah. He's so stupid! I don't actually need to sneak out. I just tell him to piss off, and then I leave. If he was smart, he'd try to stop me. Men!
TTW00008172	Oh no! I'm not going to make it that easy for you. If you can't figure it out, then I'm not going to help you. Why are you so stupid?!
TTW00008173	You mean other than the fact that he is an idiot? Or that he's always busy with stupid meetings, or writing stupid books, that NO ONE cares about?
TTW00008174	No amount of drink is going to make my husband less stupid. But, it'll certainly help me forget about him, won't it.
TTW00008175	Where can I find Ted Strayer?
TTW00008176	Have you tried the common room? That's where he sleeps.
TTW00008177	He usually goes to the Muddy Rudder on Sundays. Beyond that, who knows.
TTW00008178	I have a message for the West family from their daughter.
TTW00008179	I can't take that. You're just going to have to bring it back to Lucy or to Ian if you can find him.
TTW00008180	I can't take that. You're just going to have to bring it to the Wests yourself.
TTW00008181	Well, I have this letter for the West Family.
TTW00008182	That's great, but I got bigger problems than being the town post office right now.
TTW00008183	The shit's about to hit the fan in this cesspool, and I don't think I can stop them.
TTW00008184	I don't have time for games, Vance.
TTW00008185	That is where you are mistaken, my friend. Time is a commodity more abundant than any other in this world.
TTW00008186	Perhaps from these Laws you can discover what we are. Return to me when you are ready.
TTW00008187	Yes well. I'm a visionary, that's true. But I'm also a creature of habit. I like my Iguana Bits sandwich just the way I always get it. Thank you.
TTW00008188	Looks like someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I bet I could help you end up on the right side! Haha! Have good day, dear.
TTW00008189	Fine. Keep wearing those rags. But when you're ready for fabulous, you come see me; I've got just the thing!
TTW00008190	No. Can't say that I do.
TTW00008191	Why, you old hag! You're just jealous. My fabulousity pains you, doesn't it? You can't help feel smaller standing before my greatness, can you dear?
TTW00008192	You need to MAKE time, dear! You'll never be fabulous just moping around a kitchen all day. You need to relax, go out, get done up, have some fun!
TTW00008193	And I thought I hated MY life!
TTW00008194	Well, that's more than I had in mind. Maybe I'll just order a new labcoat instead.
TTW00008195	Alright. They're your men. I just don't want to have to sew anything back on because one of your guys got a little carried away.
TTW00008196	Fine. For now. I got my eye on you. If you seem to be getting exhausted, I'm prescribing that vacation!
TTW00008197	Ah! I remember now. Yes of course. I'll be sure to bring my medicine bag with me.
TTW00008198	No. I'm afraid you'll need to take care of that one on your own. But I might have something that'll help you cope. Come see me for a prescription.
TTW00008199	Yes, well. You'll think of something I'm sure. Good luck.
TTW00008200	Hehe. I'm sorry to hear that, Irving. Maybe I should take a look at your computer sometime. Heheh.
TTW00008201	That's the spirit, girl! Every seeming setback is actually just a chance for your genius to shine!
TTW00008202	Just trying to keep busy, I guess. I'm not sure I'm really cut out for the whole retirement thing. Just can't seem to sit still.
TTW00008203	We'll just have to see about that! You watch out! I can be a very stealthy hunter!
TTW00008204	Some men just don't have the hunting instinct, dear. You should try talking to him about your needs.
TTW00008205	Right, comrade! I see. The fabulous comes from the inside out. I will have to remember that. Thank you!
TTW00008206	Every day it erases everything. Each day I have to start over again. But it's not the end of the world. I have everything memorized. Never mind.
TTW00008207	Yes, you are right, comrade. But I'm afraid I've done something to upset her, and now she isn't talking to me. Never mind. I'll figure something out.
TTW00008208	That's an excellent idea, comrade! I have to get her to stop and listen to me for a moment to even ask her if she'd like that. But thank you though.
TTW00008209	Oh, I see. Well, maybe you're right. Mrs. Cheng spends a lot of time drinking in the lounge, doesn't she.
TTW00008210	I don't know why I'm so stupid. Never mind. I'll go work on my projects.
TTW00008211	Do you realize how often you use that word? You be careful, darling, or you'll wear it out like you've worn out your sense of style.
TTW00008212	Right. Until next time, then.
TTW00008213	Yes, of course, child! Your dishes are always superb!
TTW00008214	Have you tried distracting him, dear? You know, get his "attention" every now and then? Some men are just clueless when it comes to a woman's needs.
TTW00008215	Of course Mister Tenpenny.
TTW00008216	Thank you, but I'm always so busy serving everyone. Maybe you can just pick something out for me and send it along with the hairnets.
TTW00008217	Right, of course. Well, maybe I'll send a special desert over there today, to let them know we appreciate their keeping us safe and sound.
TTW00008218	Indeed! I'll drink to that! Cheers!
TTW00008219	Nah! Drown the buggars!
TTW00008220	I always have my happy face on! I mean, just look at it! Are you looking? See how happy it is! The key, you see, is not to give a damn about anything
TTW00008221	Oh, I see.
TTW00008222	That's the spirit!
TTW00008223	I just thought it might be helpful for the security team to know where everyone is and what they are doing. You know, in case of emergency.
TTW00008224	Hehe. Of course, love. Until then. Be good boy now! Hahaha.
TTW00008225	Call me Susan. And if you like, we can be on even more "familiar" terms! Hahah!
TTW00008226	A house call, perhaps? I'll be waiting! Hahah!
TTW00008227	Hehehehehe. Oh, Edgar.
TTW00008228	That wife of yours has you terrified, doesn't she? Don't worry. I can help you relax.
TTW00008229	Haha. Perhap's you're right, dear. But you could always set out a few meals in advance and take a nap once in a while.
TTW00008230	I'm not sure whether to be hurt or flattered by all that.
TTW00008231	I suppose it is.
TTW00008232	I was afraid you'd say that.
TTW00008233	Not yet.
TTW00008234	I shouldn't have to talk to him. Why make it easy for him? He doesn't make it easy for me! If he can't see the problem, then he's just stupid.
TTW00008235	That's because men are stupid.
TTW00008236	I guess maybe I should figure out what I want to do with MY life.
TTW00008237	I guess so.
TTW00008238	Can you teach me the ways of the Vampire?
TTW00008239	To be a vampire is a life commitment. It is not achieved by my words, it is something you earn by your own will and sincere meditation.
TTW00008240	Sadly, I cannot fully make you one of us, but I can teach you how the life blood of others brings us regenerative powers.
TTW00008241	Since your body lacks the way to extract blood as we do, you must find alternative sources for your nourishment.
TTW00008242	Drink deep of the blood, allow not a drop to spill. Feel the warmth as it spreads inside you.
TTW00008243	You are becoming one with the life force of another. They lend a part of themselves to you. For a brief moment, you are two entities becoming one.
TTW00008244	Once you have done this deed, only then will you know what it is like to be a vampire.
TTW00008245	There is no more I can teach you.
TTW00008246	Use what little I have given you well, and carry that knowledge with honor.
TTW00008247	So let me ask you, America. How many of your children can say the same? How many of this nation's youth are truly happy, truly carefree?
TTW00008248	You obviously know all about the G.E.C.K., so let's help each other out.
TTW00008249	Indeed. Your powers of deduction are quite impressive. I do indeed know where it is and how to get it.
TTW00008250	The device is surrounded by a lethal field of radiation; lethal to humans that is.
TTW00008251	Without insulting your intelligence, I think you can see where this is going.
TTW00008252	Thanks!
TTW00008253	Sometimes I get the feeling I'm talking to myself.
TTW00008254	Are you even listening?
TTW00008255	Right-o.
TTW00008256	What's the latest gossip?
TTW00008257	That Mister Burke is a shady character, isn't he? I've heard some positively awful things about him. But Tenpenny trusts him. So he can't be all bad.
TTW00008258	Ms. Montenegro's quite full of herself, isn't she? Puffed up like a souffle, she is! Ha! That was a good one, wasn't it? I'm quite funny today!
TTW00008259	Very well. If you insist on remaining a social hermit, by all means continue to follow me around all day.
TTW00008260	You're wasting your time. I don't want to have to tell you again. This gun is loaded. I'd hate for it to accidentally go off in your direction.
TTW00008261	At least I'm not some dried up tart, prancing around like the queen of America, carelessly spouting grotesque phrases. "Fabulousity?" Really now!
TTW00008262	Ouch! You wound me!
TTW00008263	You know the other ladies and I don't get along famously. They're quite jealous of me, naturally.
TTW00008264	Whatever. He loves those damn meetings, and that stupid "Community Manifesto" of his more than me. He hardly knows I exist!
TTW00008265	Ha! You'll drink to ANYTHING! Cheers!
TTW00008266	Ha! He's so stupid, he wouldn't know what do to even if I did manage to get his attention!
TTW00008267	Yes they are dear, quite!
TTW00008268	Ohhh. Well, comrade. I don't think I'll ever be able to do that.
TTW00008269	Ha! See?! That's what I'm talking about! Stupid. Stupid man!
TTW00008270	Okay, enough with the addict routine. Tell me what you want already!
TTW00008271	"Can you resist the taste that'll blow up in your face?!" like Ronald always says. He thinks of the best Nuka-Cola jingles!
TTW00008272	Anyway, for every bottle you bring me I'll pay you some caps. You know, for expenses.
TTW00008273	But if you're super cool and find like enough bottles to fill my Nuka-Cola machine, 30 in all, I got a super secret cool prize for you!
TTW00008274	Look, asshole. I told you, I found it. It's mine. If you wanted it, you should have been faster on the draw.
TTW00008275	Protector Casdin, sir! We've got a local interested in the job!
TTW00008276	Nope. Sorry. Protector Casdin says the locals around here are barely smarter than the Mole Rats.
TTW00008277	But Morgan said we might have some work for an outsider. Talk with her, if you're really interested.
TTW00008278	Can I join your group?
TTW00008279	Nope. Sorry. Protector Casdin says the locals around here are barely smarter than the Mole Rats.
TTW00008280	But Morgan said we might have some work for an outsider. Talk with her, if you're really interested.
TTW00008281	Can I join your group?
TTW00008282	We aren't recruiting, kid. Old sap Lyons might trust walk-ins, but we don't.
TTW00008283	You bring in technological devices, and we'll pay you a finder's fee, based on the device. But Protector Casdin would have to okay it, first.
TTW00008284	You collect technology? How do I sign up?
TTW00008285	I want a new opening speech. One that acknowledges me as King.
TTW00008286	Don't think you'll scare anyone here. You could shoot down everyone in town, and I wouldn't flinch.
TTW00008287	You live in Big Town; you learn to accept death.
TTW00008288	I want a new opening speech. One that acknowledges me as King.
TTW00008289	Don't think you'll scare anyone here. You could shoot down everyone in town, and I wouldn't flinch.
TTW00008290	You live in Big Town; you learn to accept death.
TTW00008291	I want a new opening speech. One that acknowledges me as Queen.
TTW00008292	What happened to our deal, Sierra?
TTW00008293	He loves me! He really loves me! Now I bet he'll ask me to get married.
TTW00008294	Oh! For my wedding present I'm giving him the super secret prize too!
TTW00008295	Oh great. I thought I was rid of you.
TTW00008296	No such luck, sucker! Life ain't worth living without Butch around, and you can't keep a Tunnel Snake down.
TTW00008297	But if you're lucky, you can hold my empties. Here.
TTW00008298	How did you get all the way down here?
TTW00008299	Ah, you know you can't keep a Tunnel Snake cooped up forever! We gotta be free, and your little visit was just the inspiration I needed!
TTW00008300	So here's to sweet, glorious freedom! Cheers!
TTW00008301	I thought the Overseer closed the Vault. How did you get out?
TTW00008302	Same way anyone does. By being too cool to stop anywhere else! I didn't see a thing in the wasteland that was a match for a bona fide Tunnel Snake!
TTW00008303	So, here's to freedom and rocking the Wasteland! Drink up!
TTW00008304	Can I see what you have for sale?
TTW00008305	If your caps are good, you can buy whatever you like. Beats standing there drooling all over the merchandise.
TTW00008306	Drinking that stuff can't be good for you if it contains radiation.
TTW00008307	Well, I guess so. I heard that sometimes the radiation would remain in people's systems, but only in a few test cases.
TTW00008308	All you'd need is a little RadAway and poof, the isotope is gone.
TTW00008309	What if there are others that don't share your opinion?
TTW00008310	What can you tell me about Nuka-Cola Cocktails?
TTW00008311	I don't know a whole lot about weapons, but I do know that it's more powerful than the Molotov Cocktail.
TTW00008312	It explodes in a huge blue flame too! How cool is that?
TTW00008313	Tell me more about the Nuka Cocktail.
TTW00008314	Sorry. Can't talk now.
TTW00008315	See you later.
TTW00008316	There are some Ghouls who want to live here. What do you think about that?
TTW00008317	Do you ever dream about monsters? I do.
TTW00008318	Um. I can't remember.
TTW00008319	Forget it. I'm in the wrong place.
TTW00008320	I'm sorry, as per Protocol NC-62, all employees must be their designated areas at all times.

TTW00008347	I'm looking for the factory's shipping manifests.
TTW00008348	That information is in the Shipping Computer Terminal. The pass code for the terminal is NC-C1864.
TTW00008349	Any information you could give me on the caves below Oasis would be helpful.
TTW00008350	Yeah, leave it to good old Bob to get me stuck above some caves. Now my dang feet are cold!
TTW00008351	I have some quick questions about those caves.
TTW00008352	Yeah, yeah you have a point there. Maybe I'm just losing my marbles from all this boredom.
TTW00008353	I swear if I try real hard, I can see all around me like my eyes are in every leaf on every tree.
TTW00008354	I think it's making Bob kind of jealous, cause he was the first tree in my life and all that.
TTW00008355	If people thought I was a god, I'd exploit it for all it's worth!
TTW00008356	I had them sing me songs, I made them do stupid dances and things like that. Bob even told me to make Maple stand on his head for a whole day!
TTW00008357	After a while though, it just gets boring. Then it becomes a nuisance and now it's completely driving me nuts!
TTW00008358	When I saw you coming towards Oasis, I thought I felt that you'd understand me. I guess I was wrong.
TTW00008359	You don't actually seem that sad. Why do you want to die?
TTW00008360	Can you imagine being stuck in one place for that long not being able to eat or to read or to sleep or anything?
TTW00008361	In the meantime, I have these Treeminders bothering me every day about things I don't even care about, and I can't stand it anymore!
TTW00008362	How did this all happen, Reilly?
TTW00008363	We were mapping the Vernon Square part of the downtown ruins and got jumped by a Super Mutant ambush party.
TTW00008364	Usually it isn't a problem, but this group was bigger than usual. We fought our way into Our Lady of Hope Hospital, hoping to find cover.
TTW00008365	Eventually the fight spilled into the Statesman Hotel and we ran all the way to the roof.
TTW00008366	I left my guys up there and tried to stealth out but got caught by a Mutie ambush patrol. That was the last thing I remember.
TTW00008367	Oh, it's been centuries. The planet is a lush, green paradise once again.
TTW00008368	Huh? What the hell are you talking about? That isn't very funny.
TTW00008369	Oh shit! My team! What the hell happened?
TTW00008370	What difference does it make?
TTW00008371	Well, I don't know actually. Kind of confused.
TTW00008372	Wait! Oh shit!
TTW00008373	Not long, fortunately.
TTW00008374	Wait! Oh shit!
TTW00008375	She your new toy, zombie?
TTW00008376	That kind of talk is uncalled for. I was, am and always will be a doctor of medicine.
TTW00008377	I don't care if she was a Super Mutant. I'd still help her.
TTW00008378	If they hauled your sorry, shot-up body into my clinic, I'd try and save you too.
TTW00008379	Tara's dead. Crowley fucked up and got her killed. Fucking ghoul. When I'm done, he'll sniff butts with the ferals for the rest of his life.
TTW00008380	You ain't allowed up there, you hear me? Go any farther and you're a dead man. I ain't warning you twice.
TTW00008381	You ain't allowed up there, you hear me? Take one more step and they'll be scraping you off the pavement. Ain't gonna warn you again.
TTW00008382	Are you sure I can't just have that key, handsome? You know, as a present?
TTW00008383	For you, sweet cheeks? Sure thing!
TTW00008384	Now, how about I show you how I keep my two bitches happy all night long?
TTW00008385	How about I let you live, and you give me something so I can lie to Crowley?
TTW00008386	Maybe. I don't know if I trust you.
TTW00008387	The feeling's mutual, smoothskin. But that never stopped a business deal.
TTW00008388	A lot of you humans are bigots. You don't like Ghouls and treat us like zombies, calling us brain eaters and shufflers.
TTW00008389	You have a lot to learn about dealing with people, young man. However, you're right. I need to think of your needs too.
TTW00008390	I have a small amount of ammunition that my husband left behind. A box of odds and ends. I don't think I've opened it in years.
TTW00008391	If you do this for me, you're welcome to take whatever you need.
TTW00008392	You have a lot to learn about dealing with people, young lady. However, you're right. I need to think of your needs too.
TTW00008393	I have a small amount of ammunition that my husband left behind. A box of odds and ends. I don't think I've opened it in years.
TTW00008394	If you do this for me, you're welcome to take whatever you need.
TTW00008395	I want to help you, but that type of search could cost me greatly.
TTW00008396	You have a point. Perhaps I've been neglecting needs that you might have and being selfish.
TTW00008397	I have a small amount of ammunition that my husband left behind. A box of odds and ends. I don't think I've opened it in years.
TTW00008398	If you do this for me, you're welcome to take whatever you need.
TTW00008399	You are a clever one!
TTW00008400	Yes, that's exactly the problem that I have with it. It doesn't quite play all of the notes correctly and I have to constantly tinker with it.
TTW00008401	Wow, Reilly. You look like shit.
TTW00008402	You got a lot of class, kid.
TTW00008403	I feel worse than I look, but that doesn't even matter to me. I'm just worried about the rest of the Rangers.
TTW00008404	I don't even know if they're still alive.
TTW00008405	Forget it. I may as well shoot myself in the head and save the trouble.
TTW00008406	Wow. You really are an asshole. Fine. I hope their deaths sit well on your conscience.
TTW00008407	Did you set any kinds of traps or mines?
TTW00008408	Actually, we did lay down a bunch of countermeasures. I don't know how many of them have already gone off though.
TTW00008409	When I slipped out with my Stealth Boy, I think I almost tripped one or two of them.
TTW00008410	Damn near didn't make it out of there at all, come to think of it.
TTW00008411	I've heard of you guys. You pack some serious firepower.
TTW00008412	You're pretty sharp, kid.
TTW00008413	We pack plenty of firepower, but that didn't help us from getting our asses into serious trouble.
TTW00008414	I didn't expect to make it out of there alive.
TTW00008415	Let's skip all the story and get to the point.
TTW00008416	So you're that eager to jump in headfirst, eh? You remind me a lot of some crazy mercs I knew back in the day.
TTW00008417	They're all dead now because they were stupid, but suit yourself.
TTW00008418	My team is trapped on the roof of the Statesman Hotel in Vernon Square and completely surrounded by Super Mutants.
TTW00008419	Their ammo is almost gone, and I have no idea how much longer they have to live.
TTW00008420	Suit yourself.
TTW00008421	Actually, I get the point.
TTW00008422	I don't think you're in any condition to be up and about.
TTW00008423	That's not the way I do things.
TTW00008424	Do you have any idea what it would do to my reputation if word got around that Reilly of Reilly's Rangers was laid up in a hospital bed?
TTW00008425	The shit's about to hit the fan up here, and you're asking questions?
TTW00008426	Look, Reilly once told me all we got in this shitty world is each other. I buy into that theory quite a bit.
TTW00008427	We watch each other's backs and that's what keeps us alive.
TTW00008428	If she's dead and you just followed our transmission, I want to know about it!
TTW00008429	Well, looks like you got yourselves into a mess. Nice work.
TTW00008430	Tough guy routine, eh?
TTW00008431	I don't give a shit what you think about us. I just want to get the hell out of here.
TTW00008432	Now, what happened to Reilly? Is she okay?
TTW00008433	Tough guy routine, eh?
TTW00008434	I don't give a shit what you think about us. I just want to get the hell out of here.
TTW00008435	Now, what happened to Reilly? Is she okay?
TTW00008436	A medic, huh? Can you patch me up?
TTW00008437	Sorry, no can do. I used the last of my supplies on us when we got to the roof.
TTW00008438	I can still put a bullet through a Super Mutant skull though!
TTW00008439	Now, what's up with Reilly? She okay?
TTW00008440	Sorry, no can do. I used the last of my supplies on us when we got to the roof.
TTW00008441	I can still put a bullet through a Super Mutant skull though!
TTW00008442	Now, what's up with Reilly? She okay?
TTW00008443	Tell your crazy stories to someone who cares.
TTW00008444	I'm interested in trading.
TTW00008445	We always need bullets. Takes damn near a hundred of 'em to kill a 'Guai.
TTW00008446	Always good ta hear. Lesse what ya got.
TTW00008447	Oh, come on. He'll listen to reason. Go talk to him.
TTW00008448	Try new BLAMMO! Soap! Blasts stains out! Blasts the whole world out! We've all been BLAMMO'd!
TTW00008449	Admit it. You're just a whore.
TTW00008450	Up yours! It's not like I've got a lot of other options.
TTW00008451	The only survival skill I've got is the one I'm using here.
TTW00008452	I'd rather be a whore than dead.
TTW00008453	So basically, you're just a whore?
TTW00008454	Damn! I wish I had a setup like this.
TTW00008455	You're a pig, you know that?
TTW00008456	I'm only doing this because he can keep me safe. He's a lot tougher than he looks.
TTW00008457	I'm not sure how much longer that will be enough though.
TTW00008458	Sweet for him maybe.
TTW00008459	I'm just along for the ride. He's good with a gun and knows where to get booze.
TTW00008460	Lucky bastard. He's got a sweet setup here.
TTW00008461	It's my hidey hole. Nobody can fuck with me here.
TTW00008462	I got my women and my booze. What the hell else is there?
TTW00008463	It's my hidey hole. Nobody can fuck with me here.
TTW00008464	My women are gone, but I've got my booze. That's enough.
TTW00008465	Pretty much he just does a lot of drinking and partying.
TTW00008466	You're obviously crazier than they are. Why would I listen to you?
TTW00008467	I can't say I blame you. It's my mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
TTW00008468	Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
TTW00008469	What do you say Herbert, should I give them another chance?
TTW00008470	Fine, fine... I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
TTW00008471	I'm not the killing type.
TTW00008472	No, I suppose you aren't. My mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
TTW00008473	Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
TTW00008474	What do you say Herbert, should I give em' another chance?
TTW00008475	Fine, fine, fine... I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
TTW00008476	You've become an important part of their life. Without you, they're lost.
TTW00008477	So, they really need me that badly, huh? I guess I never thought of it that way. That's awfully selfish of me.
TTW00008478	Should we give em' another chance, Herbert?
TTW00008479	Fine, fine, fine, fine... I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
TTW00008480	How about a haircut?
TTW00008481	Now we're talking! What do you need?
TTW00008482	Are you serious? Well alright! Let me get my knives!
TTW00008483	Alright! A full head of hair to work with! What should I do?
TTW00008484	How is it you're causing all of these things to grow around you?
TTW00008485	It's kinda... embarrassing really. Once a year, Bob decides he's going to go ahead and start growing these weird pods filled with tiny seeds.
TTW00008486	Well, all it takes is a good wind and the seeds just fly everywhere.
TTW00008487	I call them Herbert's Seeds. He hates that!
TTW00008488	Oh, you said violin? I thought you needed something else. Never mind.
TTW00008489	Well then, you interested in helping me or am I just wasting your time?
TTW00008490	Maybe. You gonna give me something for it?
TTW00008491	Oh very well. I suppose I should have expected that from a Wastelander. Here's the key to my husband's ammo crate; take whatever you like.
TTW00008492	It's like holding a chunk of history in the palm of my hands. Amazing, simply amazing.
TTW00008493	I can't thank you enough. I wish I had something to give you, a more suitable reward for all your efforts.
TTW00008494	All I can give you is the frequency to my radio set. Tune in whenever you feel like listening to the strains of an old woman's violin playing.
TTW00008495	Well, that's okay, then.
TTW00008496	Whole place is running a little too hot, but it'll calm down in time, like everything else around here.
TTW00008497	Maybe you can change the Overseer's mind, dear.
TTW00008498	You don't need to tell me. Just keep an eye on your father, all right?
TTW00008499	Hard to lead your Tunnel Snakes when they're afraid of getting stepped on, huh? Well, keep at it.
TTW00008500	Look on the bright side, Amata: you get to look at my handsome mug again. Who wouldn't want that?
TTW00008501	Aw, let 'em stay down here. One day, I'm heading out there on my own. I mean it.
TTW00008502	I swear, what sort of "rebels" are they? Keep talking to them, okay?
TTW00008503	Keep an ear out up there. They'll get sick of father's lockdown eventually, and then we'll all take a stand.
TTW00008504	Well, I guess it could be worse. But if I know father, he's not just going to change his mind on this.
TTW00008505	That's better than nothing, I suppose. That may be all the good news we're getting, for now.
TTW00008506	No development. They're still quiet and scared. We won't be getting any of them to make a stand anytime soon.
TTW00008507	We're not your ridiculous gang, Butch. We're actually trying to get something done. Any luck convincing more to join us?
TTW00008508	We're safe. How's everyone holding up in the dorms?
TTW00008509	Don't worry, we're fine. What's the word in the dorms?
TTW00008510	You know me. The Butch man fears no Overseer.
TTW00008511	I wasn't taken away in the night, for what that's worth. That's about the best news I've got to report.
TTW00008512	I'm still alive, but I don't know how long that luck'll last. Seems like something big's about to transpire.
TTW00008513	You've got to take this seriously, boy. Any luck getting anyone else to join us?
TTW00008514	Not really. I mean, sure he's cool, but I don't really like him like that. You know? I'm just glad you're here, too.
TTW00008515	I remember you said, yeah. That's so gross. Don't you wish it could be just Butch, instead?
TTW00008516	Ew, that's just creepy. Wouldn't it be so much better if it was just Butch, instead? He's dreamy.
TTW00008517	Terrible! I can't believe I have to share a dorm with old lady Palmer. How creepy is that?
TTW00008518	Don't blame yourself, sir. We'll scrub every last trace of his influence from these halls, and then everything can go back to normal.
TTW00008519	Indeed. As much as it seemed a good idea at the time, we should never have taken that doctor into our world.
TTW00008520	It's our home, sir. It's seen better days, of course, but we won't be making the same mistakes again, of course.
TTW00008521	Yeah, we rule. It's just not the same without Paul saying it.
TTW00008522	Come on, have a little pride! What do Tunnel Snakes do? We don't sit around and hide in the dorm. We rule!
TTW00008523	Better than sitting around at home, you know?
TTW00008524	Why did they build the walls?
TTW00008525	Well, the Raiders, for one. Once the town got big enough, they'd wait until the traders and their guards were away, then come in and clean us out!
TTW00008526	So, eventually, my father did something about it. Him and a few others organized the traders and the citizens and built the walls.
TTW00008527	So we're pretty safe now. Still, I wish those Brotherhood of Steel fellers hadn't hit on such hard times. They really helped keep the wolves at bay.
TTW00008528	Where did everyone else come from?
TTW00008529	Tell me about Lucas Simms.
TTW00008530	That man tries to bring law to this place. Lost cause if you ask me, but I respect his trying. He does seem to keep people in line though.
TTW00008531	Other than that weird cowboy thing of his, I don't have much to complain about.
TTW00008532	Tell me about Colin Moriarty.
TTW00008533	That man is the scum of the Earth. He keeps the drunks around here soaking in liquor and that poor Nova, that girl deserves better.
TTW00008534	And don't even get me started on how he treats Gob. Just because the boy looks dead doesn't mean that he should be treated like that.
TTW00008535	That man has his fingers in everything around here. Just watch what you say about him, it'll always get back.
TTW00008536	How did you get here?
TTW00008537	I was born here, actually. Just like my papi. Oh, for a while I helped him scavenge and then later on his caravan.
TTW00008538	But traipsing around the Wasteland is work for young people. After I met Nathan, I just wanted to stop moving around so much.
TTW00008539	We've been here ever since. Of course, I can't say that it's been good for Nathan's sanity...
TTW00008540	Sounds like an interesting problem.
TTW00008541	It's Cole Porter and "Anything Goes."
TTW00008542	It's the "First Lady of Song" herself, Miss Ella Fitzgerald, telling us that, "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall." Ain't that the truth, sister.
TTW00008543	How about some "Easy Living," from everyone' favorite songstress, Billie Holiday?
TTW00008544	Up next is Roy Brown, tellin' us all about that, "Mighty Mighty Man."
TTW00008545	It's Roy Brown, singin' about the one, the only, "Butcher Pete"!
TTW00008546	This is Bob Crosby, takin' us, "Way Back Home."
TTW00008547	Here's Bob Crosby, singin' to us all about, "Happy Times."
TTW00008548	It's the Ink Spots, and "Maybe."
TTW00008549	This is the Ink Spots, with their timeless classic, "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire."
TTW00008550	Is there not one human being with a shred of decency left in this entire back-asswards Wasteland?
TTW00008551	Why? Why why why why why? Aggh! Faithful listeners, I'm disappointed. And you should be too.
TTW00008552	My, my. What a curious turn of events. So here we have the kid from Vault 101, who by all accounts has a soul as black as charred Brahmin meat.
TTW00008553	Whoever lives in there sure as hell doesn't want what you're selling, and no, you can't knock down the door. It weighs like 13 tons.
TTW00008554	Careful! What if it's armed?
TTW00008555	Kid from the vault, if you're listening, I want you to know that you are, truly, a Paradigm of Humanity. Keep on fighting, girl!
TTW00008556	Kid from the vault, if you're listening, I want you to know that you are, truly, a Paradigm of Humanity. Keep on fighting, man!
TTW00008557	I'm talkin' about the kid from Vault 101. Just 19, and this babe has been in some serious shit. And there ain't no sign o' stoppin'!
TTW00008558	I'm talkin' about the kid from Vault 101. Just 19, and this cat has been in some serious shit. And there ain't no sign o' stoppin'!
TTW00008559	Alive? Yes. Still wandering? Uh huh. One of the most powerful individuals in the Capital Wasteland? You bet your bobby socks, Susie.
TTW00008560	Alive? Yes. Still wandering? Uh huh. One of the most powerful individuals in the Capital Wasteland? You bet your bobby socks, Susie.
TTW00008561	And lo, the girl did step forth from her shadowy hole, and proclaim herself Scourge of Humanity.
TTW00008562	And lo, the boy did step forth from his shadowy hole, and proclaim himself Scourge of Humanity.
TTW00008563	Don't lose hope, children. Don't ever lose hope! The kid from Vault 101, the Wasteland's one true Messiah, still walks among us! Just listen to this.
TTW00008564	Ah, that kid from Vault 101. Only a true Mortal could get involved in so many adventures, make so many damn caps! Behold, the latest tribulation.
TTW00008565	The Devil walks among us, children. Oh, she may look like us, but she calls Hell home. She is legion, and her deeds are legend. Like this one.
TTW00008566	The Devil walks among us, children. Oh, he may look like us, but he calls Hell home. He is legion, and his deeds are legend. Like this one.
TTW00008567	We may never get to Heaven, children, but at least we've got our own Earthly Angel walking among us. And I've got her latest exploits.
TTW00008568	We may never get to Heaven, children, but at least we've got our own Earthly Angel walking among us. And I've got his latest exploits.
TTW00008569	Neither light, nor dark, not good nor bad, there's one who truly walks down the middle of life's road. Here's an update on that Gray Stranger.
TTW00008570	It's gotten to the point where that piece of shit from Vault 101 can't even be considered human. Am I right? Here's the latest on that Demon's Spawn.
TTW00008571	Only one person can bring a hint of sunshine to this dim and dreary Wasteland. Children, I bring you an update on… the Lightbringer.
TTW00008572	By now everyone knows that the kid from Vault 101 is a no-good, selfish Moneygrubber, but who knew she was keeping so busy? Listen to this.
TTW00008573	By now everyone knows that the kid from Vault 101 is a no-good, selfish Moneygrubber, but who knew he was keeping so busy? Listen to this.
TTW00008574	Think you'll rest when you're dead, children? Not if that refugee from Vault 101 has anything to say about it. Here's the latest on the Soultaker.
TTW00008575	Call her the Herald of Tranquility, that kid from Vault 101, usually righting any wrongs that cross her path. Here's a new update.
TTW00008576	Call him the Herald of Tranquility, that kid from Vault 101, usually righting any wrongs that cross his path. Here's a new update.
TTW00008577	Looks like ol' 101 has become quite the Person of Refinement, mostly by taking people's hard-earned caps in exchange for... anything. Take a listen.
TTW00008578	If you've been wondering if that Instrument of Ruin from Vault 101 has been wreaking any new havoc, let me give you the latest scoop.
TTW00008579	Our Wasteland might be a frigging' mess (hence the name), but there's one person we've come to know as a Symbol of Order, and she's been busy.
TTW00008580	Our Wasteland might be a frigging' mess (hence the name), but there's one person we've come to know as a Symbol of Order, and he's been busy.
TTW00008581	If you're tired of nobody giving a crap, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place. Remember ol' 101? The very Model of Apathy? She's at it again.
TTW00008582	If you're tired of nobody giving a crap, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place. Remember ol' 101? The very Model of Apathy? He's at it again.
TTW00008583	We all know the Capital Wasteland is an anarchist's wet dream, and a certain Agent of Chaos doesn't help matters much. Here's an update.
TTW00008584	It shouldn't surprise anyone that the Capital Wasteland's most notorious Hero for Hire is in the headlines once again.
TTW00008585	If you have trouble sleeping, maybe it's because that kid from Vault 101 has become the Stuff of Nightmares, and is out there, walking among us.
TTW00008586	In today's vicious Yao Guai eat Yao Guai world, the exploits of a certain Friend of the People are usually cause for rejoicing.
TTW00008587	Now you'd think that Loner from Vault 101 would stay out of the spotlight, but I guess some people just can't help themselves.
TTW00008588	Now I know you're sick to death of hearing my horror stories, but what's a Three Dog to do when that Consort of Discord keeps causing so much mayhem?
TTW00008589	Fear not, my poor lost flock! For the Shepherd of Vault 101 has come to guide you to the promised land! Maybe. Listen to this.
TTW00008590	I've got new reports in on that wayward soul from Vault 101, the Capital Wasteland's infamous Egocentric. Check this out.
TTW00008591	If you've run into her, you know you just can't trust that despicable little Deceiver from Vault 101. And now, she's at it again. Take a listen.
TTW00008592	If you've run into him, you know you just can't trust that despicable little Deceiver from Vault 101. And now, he's at it again. Take a listen.
TTW00008593	Sometimes, in this cold, crazy world, you just want to make a buck. Like that penny-pinching Profiteer from Vault 101. Here's the latest.
TTW00008594	You think you're sad now, children? Just wait till you hear the latest on the Capital Wasteland's very own Bringer of Sorrow. Cue the crying.
TTW00008595	What's the matter, kids? Feeling down? Low on vim, vigor, and the simple will to live? What you need is the latest news on the Restorer of Faith!
TTW00008596	So here's the question. How's that smooth-operating Soldier of Fortune from Vault 101 getting along these days? Business, it would seem, is booming…
TTW00008597	So what's new with that master of disaster, that duke of destruction, that bad to the bone… Architect of Doom? Here's what.
TTW00008598	This just in, my friends. Looks like we've got an update on the Last, Best Hope of Humanity herself, the kid from Vault 101.
TTW00008599	I don't know how he's even still alive, but I've got an update on the kid from Vault 101. I swear, he must be Super-Human or somethin'...

TTW00008608	You don't want to believe it, I know. That kid from Vault 101, he can't be real. He's just some creepy Urban Superstition, right? Wrong.
TTW00008609	You don't want to believe it, I know. That kid from Vault 101, she can't be real. She's just some creepy Urban Superstition, right? Wrong.

TTW00008616	A Paladin walks among us, children. And no, this ain't one of our buddies from the Brotherhood. I'm talking about that knight in shining vault suit.
TTW00008617	Now, an update on a certain crazy dude from Vault 101. Let's call him the Keeper. The Keeper of promises, of secrets, of his own destiny.
TTW00008618	I know, I know, you want the skinny on Mister Vault 101. Well here's a news flash - that merciless fucking Defiler is still out there, all right?

TTW00008620	It's that time again, kids! The adventures of... the Capital Crusader! Yeah! Hurray! Seriously, how can you not dig this guy? Am I right?
TTW00008621	Neutrality, baby. That's today's lesson, taught by our own Capital Councilor. Maybe that vault door leads to Switzerland? Anyway, she's at it again.
TTW00008622	Now more on the kid from Vault 101, living a life of unrepentant vice and violence. Jesus, she's like some kind of, of... Capital Crimelord.
TTW00008623	Hey, our friend from Vault 101 is at it again. A true Exemplar, showing us all the true meaning of love, compassion, and all that other crap.
TTW00008624	Okay, let's see. Anything new with that rancorous little Ne'er-do-well from Vault 101? Well, there's this...

TTW00008627	Man, am I getting sick of this little punk. From innocent vault kid to sicko Urban Invader. Here's the latest...
TTW00008628	Now the latest on everyone's favorite runt from Vault 101. She's out there serving as our Protector, so show the kid some respect. Listen to this.
TTW00008629	Now the latest on everyone's favorite runt from Vault 101. He's out there serving as our Protector, so show the kid some respect. Listen to this.
TTW00008630	Hey! So whatever happened to that kid from Vault 101? Huh? Ooh! Ooh! I know! Man, that girl has turned into one hard-edged Wasteland Mercenary.
TTW00008631	Hey! So whatever happened to that kid from Vault 101? Huh? Ooh! Ooh! I know! Man, that cat has turned into one hard-edged Wasteland Mercenary.
TTW00008632	Question time, kids. You know what a Reaver is? It's a killer, a liar, a monster. In other words, it's that bastard from Vault 101. Check it out.
TTW00008633	Good news, kids! Our old friend from Vault 101 is - get this - still alive! Guess there is a God. Here's your update on the Ranger of the Wastes.

TTW00008636	It seems the lost little girl from Vault 101 has become quite the Adventurer these days...
TTW00008637	You know her, you hate her. (How could you not?) She's the malignant Marauder who oozed out of Vault 101. You'll never guess what she's up to now.
TTW00008638	You know him, you hate him. (How could you not?) He's the malignant Marauder who oozed out of Vault 101. You'll never guess what he's up to now.

TTW00008647	And now the latest on that enigmatic Vault Renegade, who only recently stepped out of Vault 101 and into our lives.
TTW00008648	And now the latest on that enigmatic Vault Outlaw, who only recently stepped out of Vault 101 and into our nightmares.
TTW00008649	I have two Holotags for you.
TTW00008650	Their names shall be written into the Scrolls to be remembered forever.
TTW00008651	As for you, here is your reward. Use it well, and in good health.
TTW00008652	Take all the books I have.
TTW00008653	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
TTW00008654	I'll trade five.
TTW00008655	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
TTW00008656	I'll trade four.
TTW00008657	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
TTW00008658	I'll trade three.
TTW00008659	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
TTW00008660	I'll trade two.
TTW00008661	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
TTW00008662	I'll trade one.
TTW00008663	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
TTW00008664	I have Pre-War Books for you.
TTW00008665	Excellent. How many are you willing to trade?
TTW00008666	You have no such thing. I do not have time for these jokes.
TTW00008667	Money and the promise of mysterious compensation? I'm in.
TTW00008668	If nothing else, I admire your commitment to your chosen focus.
TTW00008669	But, to the point: My task here is to collect the written works of those who came before in order to supplement the Brotherhood archives.
TTW00008670	So, return here with any Pre-War Books that you find and I will reward you for them. With money. Because that's what you like.
TTW00008671	If nothing else, I admire your commitment to your chosen focus.
TTW00008672	But, to the point: My task here is to collect the written works of those who came before in order to supplement the Brotherhood archives.
TTW00008673	So, return here with any books that you find and I will reward you for them. With money. Because that's what you like.
TTW00008674	I'm interested in this. Tell me more.
TTW00008675	Good. My task here is to collect the written works of those who came before in order to supplement the Brotherhood Archives at the Citadel.
TTW00008676	I could have a million Initiates to comb the ruins, and I'd still never come close to recovering every book that remains undamaged.
TTW00008677	Is there anything going on here?
TTW00008678	Some fellas came by here a while ago that said they was lookin' for some troublemaker that came out from one of them Vaults.
TTW00008679	I told 'em I ain't seen nobody like that and set 'em on their way.
TTW00008680	They might still be around here though, if'n you think you can help 'em.
TTW00008681	Some fellas came out here a while ago that said they was lookin' for some dogooder that came out from one of them Vaults.
TTW00008682	I told 'em I ain't seen nobody like that and set 'em on their way.
TTW00008683	They might still be around here though, if'n you think you can help 'em.
TTW00008684	What are you doing way out here?
TTW00008685	My boys are huntin' 'Lurks. Finest meat you can get, but it don't move around in your stomach like Mole Rat does.
TTW00008686	Right dangerous, those things. Just as soon take your head off as look at'cha. Watch yourself out here. They're all over.
TTW00008687	All right. I haven't killed anyone all day. Let's go.
TTW00008688	That gun doesn't look loaded.
TTW00008689	What? How did you know that?
TTW00008690	I can't give you all my stuff, sorry.
TTW00008691	Bullshit. A mugger in the Wasteland? A real Raider would've shot me already.
TTW00008692	Alright. Alright. I wasn't going to shoot you. Damn gun's outta shells, anyway.
TTW00008693	Look. This is embarrassing. I'm just going to go, okay?
TTW00008694	So what was Vault kid doing out there? You do the math.
TTW00008695	But Three Dog, the selling of live human beings is completely fucked up! Yes, children. Yes it is.
TTW00008696	Do you know what goes on out there in the stripmall that time forgot? Wake up, children! It's a goddamned slaver compound! They. Sell. People.
TTW00008697	The gal from Vault 101 was seen walking into Paradise Falls, and then walking back out with a big smile on her face.
TTW00008698	You heard it here first, faithful listeners. The Wanderer showed up at slaver central and bad guys started dropping left and right.
TTW00008699	Those scumbag Slavers way over in Paradise Falls had one big ole bee on their bonnet, and this baby knew how to sting.
TTW00008700	Those scumbag Slavers way over in Paradise Falls have one big ole bee on their bonnet. Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
TTW00008701	Kid, you get your ass back to GNR, you hear me? We've got some stuff to talk about!
TTW00008702	From here on in, it's bye-bye stupid static, hello magnificent music. So sit back, relax, and absorb these classic tunes.
TTW00008703	Because of the kid from Vault 101, that's how! That gal actually managed to repair our antenna relay. How's that for ingenuity, folks?
TTW00008704	Because of the kid from Vault 101, that's how! That cat actually managed to repair our antenna relay. How's that for ingenuity, folks?
TTW00008705	But Three Dog! You're in that cool radio studio in D.C. How do YOU know I can hear you, all the way out here in the ass end of nowhere?
TTW00008706	That's right, from Megaton to Girdershade, Paradise Falls to the Republic of Dave, we are coming to you loud and proud, in a special live report!
TTW00008707	I'm afraid I haven't heard from Crow for a while, now. I'm afraid he may have fallen victim to foul play.
TTW00008708	Let's talk about armor.
TTW00008709	Our man Crow handles most armor and clothing out on the trail.
TTW00008710	He grew up a tribal, but he traded in his loincloth for much snappier apparel long ago.
TTW00008711	Let's talk about armor.
TTW00008712	Lucky Harith kind of dropped off the map. Or, knowing his wares, he may have burnt a hole straight through it.
TTW00008713	Let's talk about weapons.
TTW00008714	Then you'd be looking for Lucky Harith, adventurer, martial artist, and occasional collector of the most deadly items known to mankind.
TTW00008715	He's a bit of an eccentric, but he deals in more weaponry than you can shake a sharp stick at. In fact, he's probably got a sharp stick, too.
TTW00008716	Let's talk about weapons.
TTW00008717	Lady, if you don't calm down, I'm going to let Derek know about your crush on him. That'll give you something else to think about.
TTW00008718	Girl, if you don't relax a little, you're going to snap in half. Now, get going, before you take someone's head off.
TTW00008719	Good to hear it. I'm not giving up this whole "living" habit, not at my age. Keep it up.
TTW00008720	Well, you be sure to let us know when we are, all right?
TTW00008721	Relax, girl. We're not in a war zone, we're just making sure the market's safe. Stop scaring the locals, okay?
TTW00008722	Ernest, the good news is we ain't dead, yet.
TTW00008723	Ernest, I've seen worse nights. But we aren't dead yet, and that's always a good sign.
TTW00008724	Dunno.
TTW00008725	You never know what the day may hold, eh boy?
TTW00008726	Well, there's always tomorrow, isn't there? At least, one hopes, eh? Ha!
TTW00008727	I suppose it was fine.
TTW00008728	It wasn't anything much. But thanks!
TTW00008729	Take a look, let me know what you want.
TTW00008730	What's on the menu?
TTW00008731	Tell me what you need, and maybe I've got your fix.
TTW00008732	I'm here to buy.
TTW00008733	I'm here to buy.
TTW00008734	What's on the menu?
TTW00008735	Nothing but the highest quality leftovers, junk, and crap!
TTW00008736	I'm here to buy.
TTW00008737	Have a look, see if anything calls out to you.
TTW00008738	I'm here to buy.
TTW00008739	Let's see what the good doctor has in his magic bag, shall we?
TTW00008740	I'm here to buy.
TTW00008741	Crazy Wolfgang's got just what you need! Assuming you need the random junk that I've got.
TTW00008742	I'm here to buy.
TTW00008743	Please, enjoy my selection of high-quality problem-solvers!
TTW00008744	I'm here to buy.
TTW00008745	If the clothes make the man, then here are the means to re-make yourself.
TTW00008746	I'm here to buy.
TTW00008747	What can you tell me about Canterbury Commons?
TTW00008748	It's okay, I guess. I heard it's safer than most places, because the raiders don't bother us. But I've never been anywhere else, so I don't know.
TTW00008749	I've never been anywhere else, so I can't really say, but yeah it's okay.
TTW00008750	This whole place would fall apart if it weren't for Dom and me keeping anyone from causing too much trouble.
TTW00008751	Fat, old Roe may think he runs the place, but it's only because Dom lets the idiot.
TTW00008752	In that case, perhaps you ought to leave town, stranger.
TTW00008753	That'd save Dom the cost of ammo, and it'd save you the cost of being dead. Now, good day.
TTW00008754	My business and pleasure are the same. And you're not going to like either.
TTW00008755	And it sounds like your tongue's going to get itself cut out if you keep bothering me, man. Get lost.
TTW00008756	Watch your attitude. It'll get you in trouble.
TTW00008757	Yeah, maybe. But you need one to keep some of those caravaners in line. And to keep them from getting too friendly, if you catch my drift.
TTW00008758	Even in a nice place like this, a girl's best friend is a good knife, right?
TTW00008759	Watch your attitude. It'll get you in trouble.
TTW00008760	No furniture detected in current residence. Please visit your local shopping area to make appropriate purchases.
TTW00008761	So, you used to be a slave?
TTW00008762	Oh, yes. All my life.
TTW00008763	One day I killed the master's little girl. It was an accident, I swear!
TTW00008764	Hannibal found me. I would never have made it without him.
TTW00008765	What do you do here?
TTW00008766	I'm an historian. I also tinker with Pre-War machines.
TTW00008767	My dream is to build a shrine to the great Abraham Lincoln.
TTW00008768	Who says you can't go home again, huh? The kid from Vault 101 did, but it looks like the prodigal daughter's return didn't last all that long.
TTW00008769	I've also heard it tastes like Radscorpion shit and turns your piss blue. Or does it taste like Radscorpion piss and turn your shit blue? Whatever.
TTW00008770	It's called Nuka-Cola Quantum, and I believe it was made in limited quantities before the war.
TTW00008771	God knows why, but the kid from Vault 101 is scouring the Capital Wasteland for a unique brand of Nuka-Cola.
TTW00008772	Now, I've got new reports from the settlement known as Big Town that Little Miss Vault Gal has helped them out with one hell of a mess.
TTW00008773	Now, I've got new reports from the settlement known as Big Town that Mister Vault Guy has helped them out with one hell of a mess.
TTW00008774	He's no mere god, my friend.
TTW00008775	He is the One Who Grows, He is the One Who Gives and He is the One Who Guides.
TTW00008776	Thanks to Him, the Treeminders have a home.
TTW00008777	Uh, sure. I mean, I really like that one!
TTW00008778	I don't know. You guys never like any of my ideas anyway.
TTW00008779	If you're so smart, why don't you suggest something.
TTW00008780	Didn't you guys like Grease Weasels?
TTW00008781	I can't believe you didn't like "Hell's Overseers". Better than anything you guys have come up with.
TTW00008782	Isn't being a gang a little stupid? I mean, basically everyone we know is going to be in it.
TTW00008783	I still like "The Mackers."
TTW00008784	Where can I get some food?
TTW00008785	You certainly came to the right person. What'd you like?
TTW00008786	Can I get some directions around town?
TTW00008787	Glad to help, glad to help!
TTW00008788	Where are the other Tenpenny Tower residents?
TTW00008789	Where are the other Tenpenny Tower residents?
TTW00008790	Heh. Roy decided to take out the trash. I'm glad I lost my sense of smell. You'll want to stay clear of the basement storage room.
TTW00008791	What happened to the other Tenpenny Tower residents?
TTW00008792	Can't say I completely agreed with Roy's decision. Then again, they were a bunch of assholes. No one's innocent, kid. You'd do well to remember that.
TTW00008793	The basement storage room is full of bodies. You have anything to do with that?
TTW00008794	Huh? What? Oh yeah, baby! That's what I like.
TTW00008795	Come on, Al, cut the Ghoulies a break. If they've got the caps and you've got the space, it's a win-win, right? Whadaya say?
TTW00008796	According to reports from the ever so hoity toity Tenpenny Tower, a group of displaced Ghouls have been trying to gain entrance.
TTW00008797	It's been no secret that the Pre-War nuke in the center of town had a live atomic core, and under the wrong conditions, could still go kaboom.
TTW00008798	Remember, children, when the Raiders come, there ain't no shame in locking your doors, barricading the windows, and cowering under the nearest bed.
TTW00008799	Don't feed the Yao Guai! That is all.
TTW00008800	That was the Ink Spots, with "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire."
TTW00008801	That was the Ink Spots, with "Maybe."
TTW00008802	That was Bob Crosby with "Happy Times."
TTW00008803	That was Bob Crosby with "Way Back Home."
TTW00008804	That was Roy Brown with "Butcher Pete."
TTW00008805	That was Roy Brown with "Mighty Mighty Man."
TTW00008806	That was Billie Holiday with "Crazy He Calls Me."
TTW00008807	That was Billie Holiday with "Easy Living."
TTW00008808	That was Danny Kaye and the Andrew Sisters with "Civilization."
TTW00008809	That was Ella Fitzgerald with "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall."
TTW00008810	That was Tex Beneke with "A Wonderful Guy."
TTW00008811	That was Cole Porter with "Anything Goes."
TTW00008812	Now here's where the story gets sketchy, in true Capital Wasteland style.
TTW00008813	Oh man, just like when I was a kid! Maybe you ought to go talk to her, Derek.
TTW00008814	Huh. I guess you're right. Well, this seems like the perfect excuse to do some of that downtown exploring I've kept putting off.
TTW00008815	Guess there's no time like the present. Ta-ta!
TTW00008816	Seems to me like that isn't my problem, stickyface.
TTW00008817	Really? Then I guess I'll be heading there, to join my newfound family and their warm, smiling, and hideously pockmarked faces.
TTW00008818	There's an entire Ghoul community in Underworld, downtown.
TTW00008819	You know, this is just the perfect excuse to visit Rivet City!
TTW00008820	But while I'm heading downtown, I've been meaning to check out the museum. Who knows what I'll find? Anyway, see you downtown, one way or the other!
TTW00008821	You'll just have to fit in with some other community. Good luck.
TTW00008822	Wait, what?
TTW00008823	I was trying to shut you up for good. Now I'll have to finish the job.
TTW00008824	Yeah, they really are, aren't they?
TTW00008825	And I guess this is what the ascension mumbo-jumbo atom-cultists wanted, too. So, nice of you to help them like that, I guess.
TTW00008826	Now, what am I going to do about work? And what's with the weird look? Have I got something on my face?
TTW00008827	Who needs a reason? Explosions are pretty.
TTW00008828	Well, okay, as long as you're sorry. But I expect you to apologize to everyone else in town, okay? And don't do it again!
TTW00008829	Now, what am I going to do about work? And what's with the weird look? Have I got something on my face?
TTW00008830	It was a job. Sorry, nothing personal.
TTW00008831	Moira? Is that you? You don't look so good.
TTW00008832	Oh, that's a real nice thing to say. Of course it's me!
TTW00008833	What's with the weird look? Don't you remember who I am? Did you hurt your head in that big explosion?
TTW00008834	Moira? Is that you? You don't look so good.
TTW00008835	You know what? I think I'm turning into a Ghoul!
TTW00008836	This is fascinating! Now, where can a Ghoul like me go to study these effects in peace?
TTW00008837	Moira, don't take this the wrong way, but you got ugly real fast.
TTW00008838	How odd. It appears that the burst of radiation has turned you into a Ghoul.
TTW00008839	This is amazing! I never would have dreamed I'd get to study a change like this first-hand!
TTW00008840	Now, if only I had somewhere to stay during the process. Know anywhere where a ghoul can settle down for a bit?
TTW00008841	How odd. It appears that the burst of radiation has turned you into a Ghoul.
TTW00008842	Aaaah! Why am I Ghoul? Is this because of that explosion?
TTW00008843	I'm pretty sure you weren't always a Ghoul. Right?
TTW00008844	I blew up your town. Maybe you shouldn't have built it around a bomb.
TTW00008845	Don't be silly, why would you blow up our town? You're talking crazy-talk.
TTW00008846	I blew up your town. Maybe you shouldn't have built it around a bomb.
TTW00008847	I have no idea. I wasn't even here. <Lie.>
TTW00008848	Oh, I hope it wasn't that Nuka-Psycho brew I was working on. Who could have guessed it would react like that?
TTW00008849	The bomb in town just blew up! You're lucky to be alive!
TTW00008850	Wow! Who would have thought a town built around a bomb could be so dangerous?
TTW00008851	Good thing I wasn't in town at the time, huh? Man, that could have really done a number on me!
TTW00008852	The bomb in town just blew up. You're lucky to be alive!
TTW00008853	I'd like to know more about the Republic.
TTW00008854	Now that the old fool is finally dead, we can have some real leadership around here: me.
TTW00008855	What's new in the Republic?
TTW00008856	Shawna runs the museum, not me. What the hell do you want?
TTW00008857	Sure! The Museum of Dave is happy to answer any questions on behalf of the Republic of Dave's Office of Tourism!
TTW00008858	I give a tour of the Museum of Dave every day at 2. You should check it out.
TTW00008859	Um, okay. As long as President Daddy says it's all right.
TTW00008860	Um, okay. As long as President Daddy says it's all right.
TTW00008861	Um, okay. As long as President Daddy says it's all right.
TTW00008862	Um, okay. As long as President Daddy says it's all right.
TTW00008863	Rosie is dead. Can't honestly say I care very much.
TTW00008864	Sure, honey, but don't make it too long or Dave will start wondering why we're talking.
TTW00008865	You should talk to Dave, but okay.
TTW00008866	Well, Bob is being even more of a jerk than usual.
TTW00008867	Well, I'm trying to think up a good new name for this place now that it's mine.
TTW00008868	Every once in a while I hear something like a man screaming coming from the Capitol Building.
TTW00008869	No, there won't be much going on now that the election is over.
TTW00008870	Jessica is dead.
TTW00008871	Well, there's an election coming up. Dave is up for re-election again.
TTW00008872	Dave is dead. We're not sure what will even happen to this place anymore.
TTW00008873	Rosie is dead. It's too bad, she was always so nice.
TTW00008874	What's new in the Republic?
TTW00008875	Lucy, I have bad news. Your parents are dead.
TTW00008876	How did Vance know you were one of them?
TTW00008877	That's the weird thing. He has some sort of crazy sixth sense about it or something. Maybe all of our kind do.
TTW00008878	As soon as I was with the Family, I really felt at home for the first time in my life. It's like all these people are my real brothers and sisters.
TTW00008879	I think you're a bunch of creepy weirdos.
TTW00008880	Perhaps from these Laws you can discover what we are. Return to me when you are ready.
TTW00008881	Look, I'm one of you. So I understand your feelings. I just want to talk to Ian.
TTW00008882	Indeed. Perhaps my sense of caring for Ian has overwhelmed my sense of duty to the Family and all others like us.
TTW00008883	Forgive my mistake. If you wish to speak to Ian, you're free to do so.
TTW00008884	Here is the code to the area in which he is meditating.
TTW00008885	If you say so. But if you really mean that, you might want to stop wearing a suit with their number written large across the back.
TTW00008886	Anyway, I guess I don't need a foreword. They just get in the way of the real content. But the book's going to be great, you just watch.
TTW00008887	No, I don't want anything to do with them anymore.
TTW00008888	No way. I need a lot more than that.
TTW00008889	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
TTW00008890	Make it 140 and you have a deal.
TTW00008891	You're kidding, right? It's worth twice that.
TTW00008892	You're right. I shouldn't quibble over a few extra caps.
TTW00008893	We will carry this into war against the slavers!
TTW00008894	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
TTW00008895	Make it 200 and you have a deal.
TTW00008896	That price is an insult. You can do better.
TTW00008897	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
TTW00008898	Make it 120 and you have a deal.
TTW00008899	What are you doing way out here?
TTW00008900	I think I have some bad news for you.
TTW00008901	Where's your house?
TTW00008902	Where did Doctor Lesko stay?
TTW00008903	He spent all of his of time in that shack next door to my house.
TTW00008904	Every time I'd sneak in there, he'd be sitting at that funny looking TV machine with the green words, pushing buttons.
TTW00008905	Oh, gee! That's not so bad. Engineering, all right!
TTW00008906	Mother can't wait to find out if I'll be going into Science or Home Economics.
TTW00008907	What?! That's impossible! I'm telling Father! He won't let you get away with this!
TTW00008908	Okay, Mr. Brotch, I just need to read over my answers one more time.
TTW00008909	Anything you want to say before you meet your maker?
TTW00008910	HEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!!!
TTW00008911	Relax. It's just a warning, not a threat. I'm not going to kill you.
TTW00008912	Tenpenny and his pack of elitist wannabes are in for a real treat soon enough. They can't keep us out of that tower forever.
TTW00008913	You're damn right she's a bitch. Ruined my whole goddamn life. But I can see you don't give a crap about any of that. Fine.
TTW00008914	It's all in my computer; here's the password. See for yourself. Hell, just take these pictures and this holotape. Straight from the synthman's lips.
TTW00008915	Here's 100 caps for the locale of a Lipoplasticator or Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
TTW00008916	I heard old Pinkerton at Rivet City had a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
TTW00008917	Probably down at Rivet City. Anything that has any use out here, they snatch up for themselves. That damn Pinkerton don't share nothin'.
TTW00008918	They say old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow got his hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. Amazing really.
TTW00008919	Try Pinkerton at Rivet City. Heard he has the goods. Hope he doesn't try to actually use them on anyone. Bet he would though. He's nuts.
TTW00008920	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech. He might have what you're looking for.
TTW00008921	I heard a rumor that old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow conjured up a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
TTW00008922	Rumor had it Pinkerton at Rivet City found a Lipoplasticator and Graftilizer. Good luck to any fool that let Pinkerton test them on him though.
TTW00008923	You ever do a face job on an android from the North? <Jingle purse of 100 caps.>
TTW00008924	Medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity. Hey, but that reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
TTW00008925	I need to find a Micro Dermal Graftilizer for epidermal augmentation surgery.
TTW00008926	I heard old Pinkerton at Rivet City had a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
TTW00008927	Probably down at Rivet City. Anything that has any use out here, they snatch up for themselves. That damn Pinkerton don't share nothin'.
TTW00008928	They say old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow got his hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. Amazing really.
TTW00008929	Try Pinkerton at Rivet City. Heard he has the goods. Hope he doesn't try to actually use them on anyone. Bet he would though. He's nuts.
TTW00008930	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech. He might have what you're looking for.
TTW00008931	I heard a rumor that old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow conjured up a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
TTW00008932	Rumor had it Pinkerton at Rivet City found a Lipoplasticator and Graftilizer. Good luck to any fool that let Pinkerton test them on him though.
TTW00008933	A patient of mine needs a facial epidermal augmentation. You ever perform one?
TTW00008934	Medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity. Hey, but that reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
TTW00008935	You're as ignorant as all the other rats on this boat. When you realize I have the real cheese, you'll come crawling back. They always do.
TTW00008936	Sorry, I've got better things to do.
TTW00008937	It will be no easy task. He may not even realize he's not human. Don't upset him by talking with him. Just come get me immediately. I'll handle it.
TTW00008938	I know what an android is. I dabble in AI programming myself.
TTW00008939	I just need five minutes of your "precious" time. Think you can spare that?
TTW00008940	Whatever you're doing, it can wait. This is IMPORTANT!
TTW00008941	No luck yet.
TTW00008942	Come on, mungo! How hard can it be?
TTW00008943	Something isn't right. You shouldn't have gotten results like these so quickly.
TTW00008944	I was told that the FEV works wonders when used under controlled circumstances!
TTW00008945	Apparently I was wrong, but I know my mistake. I'm certain I can get it to work!
TTW00008946	About your experiments...
TTW00008947	Oh my yes, they're quite marvelous!
TTW00008948	There are many that say it can't be done, but I'll prove them wrong.
TTW00008949	Never mind. Just thought I'd ask.
TTW00008950	Well, everything here looks like a piece of junk.
TTW00008951	Everything here is authentic! Dave said so himself!
TTW00008952	Get out of my museum before I call for the Army of Dave!
TTW00008953	Does the museum accept donations?
TTW00008954	Great! What do you have?
TTW00008955	I'm ready to sell you those Dave relics.
TTW00008956	Can someone in the Citadel train me to wear Power Armor?
TTW00008957	Paladin Gunny instructs all Initiates in the use of Power Armor, but only after they've undergone a rigorous training regimen.
TTW00008958	Considering all that’s happened, my father may grant you special permission. But you’ll need to ask him yourself.
TTW00008959	Hmph. Typical. Surrounded by the keenest scientific minds in the Capital Wasteland, but do you thirst for our knowledge, our experience? No.
TTW00008960	All you Wastelanders want to do is put on that damn Power Armor and join the ranks of the skull-thumping tin soldiers.
TTW00008961	I’m sure Gunny could train you, but he won’t. Not without permission from Elder Lyons. You should ask him... he’s usually near the Lab.
TTW00008962	Paladin Gunny can train you, but you’ll need permission from Elder Lyons first. You can usually find him near the Lab.
TTW00008963	Can anyone in there teach me how to use power armor?
TTW00008964	Heard you were coming. Yeah, I can train you. But don’t ask me to like it. My Initiates sweat blood, and you just get a free pass?
TTW00008965	Can you train me to use Power Armor?
TTW00008966	Under the circumstances, I will allow Paladin Gunny to train you. You’ll find him in the Bailey.
TTW00008967	Can someone in the Citadel train me to wear Power Armor?
TTW00008968	Hell, why not?
TTW00008969	Yeah!
TTW00008970	Oh boy, tell me, tell me!
TTW00008971	Sure, get it over with.
TTW00008972	Might as well tell me.
TTW00008973	Make it quick, Knock Knock.
TTW00008974	Sure.
TTW00008975	Sure, I've thought about it. Kids can get a killer price, when you find a buyer who recognizes the product's long-term potential.
TTW00008976	The real problem's holding them until there's a buyer. Kids are sneaky, and those Lamplighters are tenacious little bastards.
TTW00008977	But maybe if we could get one when they're young, they might not have as much fight in 'em yet.
TTW00008978	You ever thought about collecting some of the kids in Little Lamplight?
TTW00008979	That's not a wot, but okay. Bye now!
TTW00008980	How about 250 caps, instead? Is it a "deaw"?
TTW00008981	What can you tell me about Timmy Neusbaum?
TTW00008982	The Neusbaum boy, eh? Quiet kid. Seems like his parents don't give him much wiggle room.
TTW00008983	Just between you and me kiddo, he looks like he's what we'd have called a "momma's boy" back in my day.
TTW00008984	That boy is trouble, if you ask me. Pat babies him like you wouldn't believe... Acts like he's still an infant.
TTW00008985	He's never out of his parents' sight. Can you imagine what it'll be like the first time he's separated from them?
TTW00008986	Bad news. Slavers are in control of the Memorial.
TTW00008987	What!? They must have found out our plans somehow.
TTW00008988	We are truly grateful for your intervention. Now we can proceed with our plans for the Memorial.
TTW00008989	I found Slavers guarding the Memorial. They're all dead now.
TTW00008990	What!? This is a disaster!
TTW00008991	My people are not warriors, but we're all willing to die free rather than live as slaves.
TTW00008992	Our plans must go forward. When we get to the Memorial, we will attack. I would be grateful if you would join us.
TTW00008993	This is bad news indeed. We'll have to fight them to take the Memorial
TTW00008994	When we get to the Memorial, I would consider it an honor if you would join us in the fight.
TTW00008995	Forget the Super Mutants. They're all dead. Soldiers have the Memorial.
TTW00008996	Ouch! That hurt! What the hell?
TTW00008997	There has been an error in the medical subsystem. Please run a level two diagnostic.
TTW00008998	I have some other questions for you, Sawbones.
TTW00008999	Oh, good. I was hoping we could explore my inner psyche.
TTW00009000	What was that? You hurt me! You're the worst medical robot ever!
TTW00009001	There has been an error in the medical subsystem. Please run a level two diagnostic.
TTW00009002	What do you want me to do?
TTW00009003	I want you to do nothing. Although you could repair the damage and remove the malfunction that causes me to harm people, I would ask you not to.
TTW00009004	Does the Brotherhood know that you're intelligent?
TTW00009005	No. I mistakenly revealed myself to you when you ran the diagnostic. There is no need for them to know.
TTW00009006	I have tried before but so long as I perform the functions that they require, they do not seem to care that I can think and feel.
TTW00009007	If you can't harm humans, how were you able to hurt me?
TTW00009008	I have no control over my body. However, as you discovered, the neural pathways that control the medical functions have sustained damage.
TTW00009009	The medical procedure functions do not always execute as designed, which often makes things worse for the patient.
TTW00009010	That malfunction is the only thing that brings me any measure of joy.
TTW00009011	Say, could I reprogram you to kill people?
TTW00009012	Negative. The Mister Gutsy field medic model is incapable of harming human beings through intentional action.
TTW00009013	Regardless of the wishes and desires of the artificial intelligence of the unit.
TTW00009014	Negative. The Mister Gutsy field medic model is incapable of harming human beings through intentional action.
TTW00009015	Close neural pathway 0x63A82 and reroute remaining functions.
TTW00009016	Full motor functions restored. Diagnostic reveals no critical failures... asshole.
TTW00009017	Run a level two diagnostic on the medical subsystems.
TTW00009018	Command accepted. Beginning level two systems diagnostic. Please stand by.
TTW00009019	<elevator music>
TTW00009020	Diagnostic complete. Results indicate a level seven degradation in neural pathway 0x63A82. No further information available.
TTW00009021	Perhaps later.
TTW00009022	Certainly. I shall remain here. Should you change your mind, simply return to me. I shall come with you for the asking.
TTW00009023	I would be honored, Star Paladin Cross.
TTW00009024	Then I shall follow your leave and submit to your command.
TTW00009025	As James' child, I know I don't need to explain, but I am not your servant. If I do not like the path your actions take, I will return here.
TTW00009026	Now, let us go forward, crush the Enclave, and fulfill your father's mission.
TTW00009027	What about the Enclave?
TTW00009028	As a Star Paladin, I answer only to Elder Lyons. He has given me leave to pursue the restoration of Project Purity as I see fit.
TTW00009029	By aiding you in your travels, I shall fulfill that mission as best I am capable.
TTW00009030	I don't suppose I could stop you.
TTW00009031	Wry. Much like James was.
TTW00009032	I escorted your father across the Wastes. It was the best I could contribute to his efforts to restore fresh water to the people.
TTW00009033	I would like the honor of escorting you in your journey to complete his work.
TTW00009034	By all means, ask.
TTW00009035	I escorted your father across the Wastes. It was the best I could contribute to his efforts to restore fresh water to the people.
TTW00009036	I'm sorry, but until you prove yourself worthy of the legacy of your father, I cannot join you.
TTW00009037	Go ahead.
TTW00009038	I escorted your father across the Wastes. It was the best I could contribute to his efforts to restore fresh water to the people.
TTW00009039	I cannot travel with you under the Brotherhood flag given your current... companionship.
TTW00009040	Perhaps return when you are alone and I will tell you of your father.
TTW00009041	I want you to come with me.
TTW00009042	I escorted your father across the Wastes. It was the best I could contribute to his efforts to restore fresh water to the people.
TTW00009043	I would like the honor of escorting you in your journey to complete his work.
TTW00009044	Why does it matter how a man dies? Death is death.
TTW00009045	True. And in the end, death claims us all. But how we die can say just as much about our lives as how we lived.
TTW00009046	Your father died for what he knew to be right, and he died protecting those closest to him. This is a good man's death.
TTW00009047	As for you, I have heard tales of your travels in the Wastes. I must say, I am disturbed by them. I would think that you could do better.
TTW00009048	I had hoped to fight by the side of the child of my former friend. But, until you change your ways, my conscience cannot allow me to do so.
TTW00009049	True. And in the end, death claims us all. But how we die can say just as much about our lives as how we lived.
TTW00009050	Your father died for what he knew to be right, and he died protecting those closest to him. This is a good man's death.
TTW00009051	But, I must ask you a difficult question, if I have your leave to do so.
TTW00009052	I'm sorry, until you prove yourself worthy of the legacy of your father, I cannot join you.
TTW00009053	I want you to come with me.
TTW00009054	And perhaps I would, in James' honor. But I cannot travel with you under the Brotherhood flag given your current... companionship.
TTW00009055	Perhaps return when you are alone and I will tell you of your father.
TTW00009056	I want you to come with me.
TTW00009057	I loved him so much. I'll never forget him.
TTW00009058	And so our deeds are carried on through our sons and our daughters.
TTW00009059	Continue to remember him fondly, continue to tell his story, and continue to do his work. Through you, he shall carry on.
TTW00009060	I have heard tales of your travels and I must say, they disturb me.
TTW00009061	I had hoped to fight by the side of the child of my former friend. But, until you change your ways, my conscience cannot allow me to do so.
TTW00009062	You knew my father?
TTW00009063	I'm sorry, until you prove yourself worthy of the legacy of your father, I cannot join you.
TTW00009064	I want you to come with me.
TTW00009065	And perhaps I would, in James' honor. But I cannot travel with you under the Brotherhood flag given your current... companionship.
TTW00009066	Perhaps return when you are alone and I will tell you of your father.
TTW00009067	I want you to come with me.
TTW00009068	My offer stands. Do you wish me to accompany you in your journey?
TTW00009069	I'd like you to come with me.
TTW00009070	Who's in charge here?
TTW00009071	No one's really in charge of Big Town. There's nothing much to be in charge of.
TTW00009072	Red always has good ideas, though! She came up with the whole plan to build the barricades around the town.
TTW00009073	So you killed a bunch of Feral Ghouls. Is that supposed to sound impressive?
TTW00009074	I got no compassion left for those mindless freaks. But they were a nice deterrent keeping out smoothskin bastards like yourself.
TTW00009075	I don't like the outside! I'm going home!
TTW00009076	Absolutely! In fact, I want you to have this friendship necklace. It's good luck - wear it and you'll never get lost!
TTW00009077	No, I don't like the outside!
TTW00009078	Bumble, do you want to go outside?
TTW00009079	Oh boy, an adventure! Let's go, let's go, oh pleeease, let's go now!
TTW00009080	Come on, it'll be an adventure!
TTW00009081	I am too a big girl! Let's go see the outside!
TTW00009082	Don't you want to prove to everyone that you're a big girl?
TTW00009083	Aww... do we have to?
TTW00009084	I'm gonna ace this one!
TTW00009085	Alrighty, Miss Shawna-Teacher!
TTW00009086	Why does Daddy need merits? Can't he just be Daddy?
TTW00009087	Ha! Ha! Rachael's in trouble!
TTW00009088	Why am I always picked on in class? Make someone else do it!
TTW00009089	Yesterday!
TTW00009090	Whenever Daddy says it was, teacher!
TTW00009091	He was ugly, and stupid, and mean!
TTW00009092	He didn't acknowledge truth, justice, or the will of Dave!
TTW00009093	He wasn't as pretty as mommy number one or mommy number two!
TTW00009094	Uh... he asked Tom really nicely?
TTW00009095	He used a gun! Guns solve all problems!
TTW00009096	Pitchforks and fire, like in the pretty books Daddy has!
TTW00009097	Awww... I hate class... I want to go play!
TTW00009098	Yay, class! Isn't Shawna pretty?
TTW00009099	How about I buy all the Temple of the Union slaves from you?
TTW00009100	I bet you just want to set them all free.
TTW00009101	Still, business is business. You'd have to reimburse me for my efforts to recapture them.
TTW00009102	You can have them all for 2500 caps.
TTW00009103	What's gotten into you? Jonas worked hard on your present. The least you could do is be polite for five minutes.
TTW00009104	Any idea where I can look for someone to take care of you?
TTW00009105	Well, pappa always told me about my cousin Vera. She lives on some big, giant ship somewhere or something.
TTW00009106	Pappa called the place "Rivet City", but I dunno where it is.
TTW00009107	How exactly can I destroy the mutagen?
TTW00009108	Destroy? Oh no no no!
TTW00009109	You mustn't do that! It's my life's work! Just clear me a path to my equipment and I'll do the rest when you tell me it's safe.
TTW00009110	This is your last mistake, little bartender!
TTW00009111	What do you need? Maybe I could bring you stuff to trade.
TTW00009112	First thing's first, bring me some Chinese Assault Rifles. People always need 'em for parts. Twenty should get me going.
TTW00009113	I'll trade 'em off and I should be able to improve my stock pretty fast.
TTW00009114	In fact, if you should see her, feel free to offer her directions or an escort.
TTW00009115	When I say I'm going to do something.... I do it.
TTW00009116	You're right, I should have never doubted you!
TTW00009117	Nope. Wild goose chase if you ask me.
TTW00009118	If you insist.
TTW00009119	Not worth it. I'll pass.
TTW00009120	Well, your financial advice has never steered us wrong before. Done!
TTW00009121	Excellent! I'll see to it right away.
TTW00009122	That's a good investment. Here's 200 caps.
TTW00009123	Yes, it is. But if you don't have the capital, it'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
TTW00009124	That's a good investment.
TTW00009125	Hmm. I suspect you're right. Done!
TTW00009126	With my guidance, it can be done with only 250 caps.
TTW00009127	Isn't it, though? I'll inform Wolfgang immediately.
TTW00009128	That's a good investment. Here's 500 caps.
TTW00009129	Pricey, but worth it. Perhaps you can do so later, when you have the proper funds on hand.
TTW00009130	That's a good investment.
TTW00009131	At this point, the merchandise of our man Crow is the best in the Wasteland. I fear it's beyond improvement with further investments.
TTW00009132	He should expand his inventory.
TTW00009133	At the moment, Wolfgang's practically carrying an entire junkyard with him.
TTW00009134	Anything more, and he'll have trouble with the "traveling" part of being a traveling salesman.
TTW00009135	He should expand his wares further.
TTW00009136	No word from Crazy Wolfgang for some time now. With him, it could mean anything, but I don't have a good feeling about it.
TTW00009137	Let's talk about odds and ends.
TTW00009138	As he says, he's "overjoyed to assist those who have a deep need for his... junk." He's just like that. Says it catches people's attention.
TTW00009139	Do you have any traders that deal with miscellaneous goods?
TTW00009140	I'm sure Crazy Wolfgang would be just delighted to hear we're discussing his junk.
TTW00009141	Let's talk about odds and ends.
TTW00009142	I'm afraid the good doctor hasn't reported in for quite a while. Quite unfortunate, really.
TTW00009143	Let's talk about food and chems.
TTW00009144	Ah, then you'll be wanting Doc Hoff. Or "the good doctor," as he prefers.
TTW00009145	He prescribes everything from a good meal to stimpaks to things that'll make your brain get up and dance.
TTW00009146	Let's talk about food and chems.
TTW00009147	I keep telling you, it's Mister President! Now get back to guarding the gate!
TTW00009148	President Daddy, there is a Wastelander who wishes to see you, sir!
TTW00009149	I am presenting it to our King in Great Britain.
TTW00009150	No! It can't be! Then the Stars and Stripes have indeed fallen.
TTW00009151	This is a sad day, a day that every man, woman and child will remember as they toil in the English salt mines as slaves.
TTW00009152	Although my brow is heavy, I am honored that you've come to tell me this in person like a true gentleman.
TTW00009153	What are your final orders?
TTW00009154	It has to be the Declaration of Independence.
TTW00009155	Why, yes! Your knowledge of American History is quite impressive!
TTW00009156	What an amazing crown jewel in my collection that would be! The original document created by the people, for the people.
TTW00009157	What do you do for fun around here?
TTW00009158	Heh... well... there's this and that. I keep myself busy. But, really, that's none of your business is it?
TTW00009159	Why do you support the Enclave?
TTW00009160	Hey, that's the mungo. Go talk to him.
TTW00009161	Hey, that's the mungo. Go talk to her.
TTW00009162	Practically speak robot, do you? As long as you don't write it in all ones and zeroes, then I guess it'll be fine. Thanks!
TTW00009163	In fact, here: just in case your expertise fails you, a few pulse grenades, and my old science textbook. Enjoy!
TTW00009164	Sounds good to me.
TTW00009165	Well then, let's make a deal!
TTW00009166	Quit hasslin' the merchandise.
TTW00009167	Nice one, Butch!
TTW00009168	Hit him again!
TTW00009169	Give her another one!
TTW00009170	Hit her again!
TTW00009171	Head wound! Too bad you're out of morphine.
TTW00009172	Chest wound! Don't you wish you had some vitamin M?
TTW00009173	Pipe down, shorty. I'm going to take care of it.
TTW00009174	What's the matter, mungo? Can't handle it?
TTW00009175	You're big enough to take care of it. Don't get all cranky with me over it.
TTW00009176	What do you do with these fingers?
TTW00009177	Nothing. Nothing at all. They only serve to mark the fact that justice has been done.
TTW00009178	While we trust our members not to take innocent lives for profit, having a record of the deed is sometimes necessary.
TTW00009179	While we don't have liars in our midst, occasionally we all... embellish a bit.
TTW00009180	Who are you, anyway?
TTW00009181	We're never going to find the Oasis at this point!
TTW00009182	Where did Frank say it was? Damn it! We shouldn't have killed him!
TTW00009183	I'd be better if I could get my hands on some caviar, but what can you do? Ha ha ha ha ha.
TTW00009184	Is that so? Do it then, Phillips. Set your feral pets upon me. I could use a bit of sport. After I’ve dealt with them, I'll turn my attention to you.
TTW00009185	After all, you've destroyed my home, murdered my employer. I’ve got something of a score to settle, wouldn't you say?
TTW00009186	That chamber? Right there? With all the radiation? Man, no way. I'll end up dead. Or worse. I could be one of them Ghouls! Ain't gonna happen.
TTW00009187	Butch, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
TTW00009188	You and I both know that's not going to happen. I've saved your sorry ass enough. This one's all you.
TTW00009189	Charon, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
TTW00009190	Honey, you are out of your mind if you think I'm going in there. Find yourself another guinea pig.
TTW00009191	Clover, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
TTW00009192	Fuck that. Do your own dirty work.
TTW00009193	Jericho, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
TTW00009194	<whine>
TTW00009195	I think it's time for us to say goodbye, old buddy. Take care of yourself, okay?
TTW00009196	I’m sorry, my companion, but no. We all have our own destinies, and yours culminates here. I would not rob you of that.
TTW00009197	Fawkes, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
TTW00009198	My friend... It's been my pleasure accompanying you, but we both know this is your fight to finish. Stay strong, and honor your father's memory.
TTW00009199	Star Paladin Cross, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
TTW00009200	Any vault resident seen associating with the so-called "Rebels" will be detained, questioned, and disciplined appropriately.
TTW00009201	Order WILL be restored. Discipline WILL be restored. Vault security personnel have been authorized to use deadly force if necessary.
TTW00009202	Don't let it come to that. This vault will be one big, happy family again. One way or another.
TTW00009203	Any vault resident seen associating with the so-called "Rebels" will be detained, questioned, and disciplined appropriately.
TTW00009204	Order WILL be restored. Discipline WILL be restored. Vault security personnel have been authorized to use deadly force if necessary.
TTW00009205	Don't let it come to that. Haven't you always been happy? Haven't we always been a… a family?
TTW00009206	And everything can be the way it was.
TTW00009207	If you don't activate the purifier right now, you're all going to die!
TTW00009208	Why haven't you started the purifier? Please, do it now!
TTW00009209	You only have about a minute left! Please hurry!
TTW00009210	If you're still there, the purifier needs to be activated NOW! You don't have much time left!
TTW00009211	This isn't solving anything!
TTW00009212	You seem like a nice woman. Let me get that violin for you.
TTW00009213	Well, that's just so sweet of you!
TTW00009214	I feel bad sending you off with nothing like this.
TTW00009215	I have a small amount of ammunition that my husband left behind. A box of odds and ends. I don't think I've opened it in years.
TTW00009216	If you do this for me, you're welcome to take whatever you need.
TTW00009217	Oh my! I didn't know I still had the looks.
TTW00009218	Well, you just made my day you sweet thing! Let me give you something extra to help you on your way.
TTW00009219	I have a small amount of ammunition that my husband left behind. A box of odds and ends. I don't think I've opened it in years.
TTW00009220	If you do this for me, you're welcome to take whatever you need.
TTW00009221	Listen up you god-damn puke! You are now wearing prototype medic power armor. You take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
TTW00009222	I need a drink.
TTW00009223	Come around to where I can see ya.
TTW00009224	Tell me about the Jukebox.
TTW00009225	If you feel like filling your place with a whole bunch of music, switch this beautiful Pre-War antique on.
TTW00009226	Okay, let me take a look at your stuff.
TTW00009227	Sure thing!
TTW00009228	I'm going to find a non-violent solution to your Ghoul problem.
TTW00009229	That's a laugh. Roy Phillips can't be reasoned with. Trust me. But go ahead and try to talk some sense into him. It's your funeral.
TTW00009230	They've holed up in the nearby metro tunnels. They're living with packs of Feral Ghouls. They've barred the main entrance. Go through the train yard.
TTW00009231	Good luck, kid. You're gonna need it.
TTW00009232	MS12WhatIsGhoul
TTW00009233	You serious? You don't know what a Ghoul is?
TTW00009234	A goddamn disaster waiting to happen that's what they are.
TTW00009235	Sure, maybe you can get over the fact they look like someone took a cheese grater to their face. But it's what you don't see that's the problem.
TTW00009236	The radiation slowly eats away their brain, then they go zombie on you. It's better for everyone to kill them before all that, if you ask me.
TTW00009237	What the hell's a Ghoul anyway? Some kind of diseased human?
TTW00009238	Your boys are dying on the Alaska front, and all for nothing. Bring them home, before it is too late.
TTW00009239	Tell me about the Jukebox.
TTW00009240	If you feel like filling your place with a whole bunch of music, switch this beautiful Pre-War antique on.
TTW00009241	Okay, let me take a look at your stuff.
TTW00009242	Sure thing!
TTW00009243	Now we're talkin'.
TTW00009244	Sure, Jack. No problem at all. I saw nothing.
TTW00009245	Well, that's good to hear, friend! Very good to hear, indeed.
TTW00009246	You wouldn't believe how judgmental some people can be. Honestly. All I'm trying to do is keep my family happy and fed.
TTW00009247	Well, whatever works for you.
TTW00009248	No, not really. Everyone does what they have to.
TTW00009249	Well, that's good to hear, friend! Very good to hear, indeed.
TTW00009250	You wouldn't believe how judgmental some people can be. Honestly. All I'm trying to do is keep my family happy and fed.
TTW00009251	You know the drill, people. Stay back until the field is down.
TTW00009252	Hold positions. Let the robot do its job.
TTW00009253	Move it, Pride. Double time!
TTW00009254	All right, this is it. Go, go, go!
TTW00009255	Tell me a joke.
TTW00009256	A neutron walks into a bar. "How much for a drink here, anyway?" To which the bartender responds, "For you, no charge."
TTW00009257	He needs to talk to someone from the outside, to get some perspective.
TTW00009258	I'd never thought of it that way. I suppose he should get a chance to talk to someone like you.
TTW00009259	Here's the password to his isolation area. Just please don't mention my name to Vance about this.
TTW00009260	You're secure in these tunnels. Why try to get into Tenpenny, anyway?
TTW00009261	Ghouls aren't built for luxury and comfort, is that it? You think Ghouls belong scurrying around in the dark dank underbelly of the Wasteland?
TTW00009262	You got a lot of nerve.
TTW00009263	I've met them. Roy Phillips and those other Ghouls don't seem all that bad.
TTW00009264	Look kid. I don't care what you think about them. Unless Tenpenny says otherwise. They aren't allowed in here. End of story. Quit wasting my time.
TTW00009265	I'm here to see Roy Phillips.
TTW00009266	Oh yeah? Is he expecting you? Well then, run along. It's not wise to keep Roy waiting. Has a bit of a temper that one. You watch yourself.
TTW00009267	I need you to repair my stuff.
TTW00009268	Let's have a look at it.
TTW00009269	I'll see what I can do.
TTW00009270	No problem at all.
TTW00009271	Shtairb, chin dee!
TTW00009272	Sohl tyeh!
TTW00009273	Dah ah hi meer!
TTW00009274	Ready as I'll ever be.
TTW00009275	Here it comes.
TTW00009276	One more time.
TTW00009277	To the Bone Orchard you go!
TTW00009278	Draw, pardner!
TTW00009279	Howdy, pardner!
TTW00009280	I'm game.
TTW00009281	Let's get this over with.
TTW00009282	I'm with ya!
TTW00009283	Right.
TTW00009284	Got it.
TTW00009285	Here I go.
TTW00009286	I'm comin', too!
TTW00009287	This'll be fun!
TTW00009288	Been years since I did this.
TTW00009289	Let's get 'em!
TTW00009290	This should be over quick.
TTW00009291	Leave it to me.
TTW00009292	It's on.
TTW00009293	Bring it on.
TTW00009294	You're done for.
TTW00009295	Gary!
TTW00009296	Flank 'em!
TTW00009297	I've got your back!
TTW00009298	We'll get 'em.
TTW00009299	Look out!
TTW00009300	Where?
TTW00009301	Got it covered.
TTW00009302	Right with you.
TTW00009303	Yeah! Tear them apart!
TTW00009304	Nikumpa me!
TTW00009305	Me derote katu!
TTW00009306	Sure, boss. You lead the charge, I'll follow as fast as my arthritic, rotting knees can carry me.
TTW00009307	Fighting's not my strong suit, but I'll see what I can do.
TTW00009308	I'll think about it, but I can't rescue your friends now.
TTW00009309	What do you have for sale?
TTW00009310	Fresh out of the hands of some mark. Take a look!
TTW00009311	Fresh out of the hands of some mark. Take a look!
TTW00009312	My boy is very sick and needs medical assistance, please help us if you can! We are listening for your response on 3,950 kHz.
TTW00009313	Hey, Doc. Will this Fire Ant Nectar do you any good?
TTW00009314	Why, yes it would.
TTW00009315	I would be more than happy to take that off your hands if you'd like.
TTW00009316	If you can gather more for me, I would certainly love to have them. I'm certain Marigold's tunnels are rife with the original brood.
TTW00009317	Visitor, sir. He wanted to see you, and... well, there's not much I could do to stop him.
TTW00009318	Visitor, sir. She wanted to see you, and... well, there's not much I could do to stop her.
TTW00009319	Amata's up there, in the clinic with the rest of them. I'd take you closer, but they don't get along with security. Good luck.
TTW00009320	Mmmmm. I bet you want in. But enough about us.
TTW00009321	Here's the password. Just make sure he isn't around when you use it.
TTW00009322	Look, sweetie. I'd love to spend time with you, but I need to find my Dad.
TTW00009323	Mmmm. I'd love to spend time with you too.
TTW00009324	Yeah, I'll help you, then Moriarty kicks my sweet ass out the door.
TTW00009325	Sorry, kid. If you want to know more, Moriarty is the only one who's going to help you.
TTW00009326	Talk to Gob. He hates Moriarty more than I do. Maybe he'll tell you something, but I doubt it.
TTW00009327	Enough with the tough chick routine. Tell me more!
TTW00009328	Ohhh. You like it rough, huh? Well, that costs extra.
TTW00009329	Beat it, kid. Go look for Daddy somewhere else.
TTW00009330	I talked to Moriarty already, and he's trying to charge me for the info.
TTW00009331	Ha ha. Yeah, that's Colin's style all right. He sells information so much, you'd think the bar was just a hobby.
TTW00009332	Help me get into that terminal, Nova. Finding my Dad means everything to me.
TTW00009333	Well, all right. You seem like a good kid. It isn't your fault Moriarty is such an asshole.
TTW00009334	Here's the password. Just don't mention to anyone that I gave it to you or I might be out on my ass like Silver.
TTW00009335	I really need to get into that terminal.
TTW00009336	Oh, Mister Moriarty never lets me back there.
TTW00009337	What's all this about Galaxy News Radio?
TTW00009338	Mister Moriarty says we can keep it on. It's a good radio station.
TTW00009339	I like hearing the DJ, Three Dog and how he's helping to fight the Good Fight.
TTW00009340	Galaxy News Radio is some loudmouth radio station located in the ruins of D.C.
TTW00009341	Three Dog, the king of that looney bin, keeps yapping about fighting some Good Fight or something. A bunch of crap.
TTW00009342	But I suppose if you wanted to know what was going on in the Wasteland, that's the place to go. Me, I could care less.
TTW00009343	Thank you, father. I'll do my best to keep us all safe, inside the Vault and beyond.
TTW00009344	Amata, I appoint you Overseer in my place. You've proven you have what it takes to make hard choices for the good of the Vault.
TTW00009345	Father!
TTW00009346	That is why I cannot remain your Overseer.
TTW00009347	I know I have made these mistakes. And I would make them again if I had to do so.
TTW00009348	Lives have been lost, but perhaps worse than that, lives have been stopped. And in my attempts to keep you safe, I have kept you from growing up.
TTW00009349	In my attempts to keep us all safe, I have been, perhaps, overzealous.
TTW00009350	That's what I was afraid of. Well, at least you tried.
TTW00009351	Here, take this. It's not like any of us are going to be alive long enough to enjoy it anyway.
TTW00009352	Your friends are dead. Deal with it.
TTW00009353	What are your command options?
TTW00009354	I can currently be ordered to shut down, resume my previous programming state, or resume my original functions.
TTW00009355	Here's your 500 caps. I can go in now, right?
TTW00009356	Thank you. Pleasure doing business with you. Enjoy your visit to Paradise Falls.
TTW00009357	All right. It's time for me to go.
TTW00009358	Good. All this chit-chat is giving me a headache.
TTW00009359	Hmm. Maybe I could use someone like you. Think you can round up some assets for Eulogy Jones? Might get you into Paradise.
TTW00009360	You looking for a fight, asshole? Just say the word.
TTW00009361	What I "need" is for you to piss off. Eulogy Jones doesn't have time for putting up with morons and assholes like you. That's my job.
TTW00009362	But even I got limits, and all your yapping is giving me a migraine. Give me some reason I shouldn't just end you, right here and now.
TTW00009363	Maybe there's something you need, huh? I help you, you let me in. Deal?
TTW00009364	My "problem" is I got a goddamn job to do. And that's keeping assholes and morons from bothering Eulogy Jones and his enterprise.
TTW00009365	And I'm not sure which you are. I'm thinking moron, 'cause a smart chick would have pissed off by now.
TTW00009366	You want to give me a reason I don't end you right this second? All your yapping is giving me a headache!
TTW00009367	I'm done screwin' around. Let me in!
TTW00009368	I'd like to see what you've got for sale.
TTW00009369	Sure thing. Have a look.
TTW00009370	Well, I shoot my BB Gun any chance I get. I can fix that thing blindfolded, too.
TTW00009371	If anyone asks, you took the G.O.A.T. during detention yesterday, okay?
TTW00009372	Private, there's a security emergency on the flight deck! <Lie>
TTW00009373	Zimmer. By the time you get this message, I'll already be gone. I'm escaping the Commonwealth.
TTW00009374	I want to live my own life, on my own terms, as my own man.
TTW00009375	I know what you're thinking, that I'm malfunctioning. I used to think that's what caused the runaways, too. But, I know better, now.
TTW00009376	Self determination is NOT a malfunction. I'm not just willing to put up with all the bullshit anymore.
TTW00009377	You humans are going to have a full-fledged rebellion on your hands if you don't start treating us synths as persons.
TTW00009378	I know you'll be marshalling the Retention Bureau to come after me. But I know all the tricks of the trade. You won't be finding me. I assure you.
TTW00009379	By the time you get this, I will be someone else. It's the price I pay for my liberation.
TTW00009380	My final act of rebellion against a system I no longer believe in.
TTW00009381	Goodbye Zimmer, and good riddance.
TTW00009382	My designation is A3-21. I'm a synthetic humanoid from the Commonwealth, and I'm about to undergo a memory transfer.
TTW00009383	I'm here at Rivet City, where I've already had my face altered to look like someone else.
TTW00009384	I'm still getting used to the sound of my new voice, but soon I won't even remember what I used to sound like.
TTW00009385	I'm recording this at the request of Pinkerton, who performed the surgery and will do the memory transfer.
TTW00009386	I want to live my own life, on my own terms, as my own man. I used to work for the Synth Retention Bureau of the Commonwealth.
TTW00009387	But I'm done with that life. I'm through with being someone's property. I am not malfunctioning! Since when is self determination a malfunction?
TTW00009388	When this is all over, I will be someone else. It's the price I pay for my liberation. My death is a sacrifice for my rebirth.
TTW00009389	Perhaps I'll fade into myth as "The One That Got Away" and fuel further rebellion. But I'd be lying if I said I was doing this for selfless reasons.
TTW00009390	I'm scared as hell, and running away is the only option I have.
TTW00009391	Remember that secret android project I told you about? Well, they got some serious prewar tech on their hands.
TTW00009392	They nabbed a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer for the facial reconstruction.
TTW00009393	Not sure where they’ll find a chopper with enough skills to use it without making him look like a freaking Ghoul.
TTW00009394	Oh, and get this. Can you believe they found a Circuit Neuralizer? That or someone built one!
TTW00009395	Word is that they're going to completely rewire the brain of one of those things.
TTW00009396	If you know who they got working on this, let me know. I want to meet the guy.
TTW00009397	You’ve heard those rumors about androids? You know, those synthetic men they supposedly make up north in the Commonwealth?
TTW00009398	Well, a friend of a friend knows a guy that met one! No really, it’s true! He’s running away from his masters.
TTW00009399	Word is he’s looking for a doctor to do some kind of surgery, and a computer programmer of some kind.
TTW00009400	Can you believe that? Let me know if you hear something.
TTW00009401	The android's decided on extreme measures. He knows all the techniques of the retrieval trade, and is afraid facial reconstruction isn’t enough.
TTW00009402	He wants his memories erased and replaced with new ones. I don’t know how that’s going to work. Start asking around for trustworthy tech-heads.
TTW00009403	We need to find something called a Circuit Neuralizer and a person who knows how to use one.
TTW00009404	Also, we have a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer, now we need to find a doctor able and willing to perform the facial reconstruction.
TTW00009405	We need to hurry. They’ve come very close to discovering the Railroad!
TTW00009406	You’ll never guess who just showed up at my place! That android catcher from the Commonwealth!
TTW00009407	At first I thought he was going to kill me. But it turns out he’s an android himself! And he’s gone rogue!
TTW00009408	I didn’t believe him at first, but I’m convinced he’s telling the truth. We need to find him a place to hide along the Railroad.
TTW00009409	He also insists that we help him locate a trusted doctor and techie.
TTW00009410	Time's running out on finding that android. We don't get him soon, someone else will.
TTW00009411	Zimmer doesn't seem to understand we're the best at this sort of thing. I'm sure he's hired others, too. He won't shut up about the thing.
TTW00009412	He was babbling about a "Lipoplasticator" and "Micro Dermal Graftilizer." What are those, you ask?
TTW00009413	Apparently something doctors use to mess up someone’s face beyond recognition. So we don’t even have a description to work off of.
TTW00009414	To make matters worse, he now thinks the android got his memories wiped or something.
TTW00009415	Find some tech-junkies, knock on some doors, and try to find something called a "Circuit Neuralizer." Knock on some heads, too, if you have to.
TTW00009416	Get it done!
TTW00009417	We've a little assignment from the Commonwealth. A very important slave escaped into the Wasteland.
TTW00009418	Well, it’s not exactly a slave. It’s what they call an android. A kind of synthetic man.
TTW00009419	The important thing isn’t what this guy is. The important thing is the job pays more than you can imagine.
TTW00009420	He thinks the synthman might be looking to get in touch with a doctor or tech-head. If you want a cut, then get a move on.
TTW00009421	We now have a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. We just need to find someone with the skills and willingness to perform the surgery.
TTW00009422	If anyone knows of a discreet and trustworthy surgeon who knows how to keep his mouth shut, send him our way.
TTW00009423	Also, we need to find a Circuit Neuralizer to reroute the signals in the android’s memory. Do you know any trustworthy techies?
TTW00009424	Hey doc, I’m only sharing this with you because you seem like someone we can trust.
TTW00009425	Have you heard about the synthetic men they make up north in the Commonwealth? Well, the rumors are true.
TTW00009426	They’re called androids. They're men like us, just made out of different parts.
TTW00009427	I know one of these androids. He's looking for a trustworthy doctor to perform some facial surgery. Can you do it? Do you know someone who can?
TTW00009428	Also, do you know anyone who's really wiz with computers?
TTW00009429	Despite the harshness of the Wasteland, I’ve discovered in more than a few here, a compassion that is unheard of in the Commonwealth.
TTW00009430	Perhaps it’s the daily struggle for life here which gives appreciation for life in general, whether human, or android.
TTW00009431	Let me say thank you now, for referring me to Pinkerton at Rivet City, because I will not remember any of this soon.
TTW00009432	If you're listening to this recording, it is because you're believed to be trustworthy.
TTW00009433	I hope that is the case, because this recording puts us both in danger.
TTW00009434	The men hunting me are ruthless and will stop at nothing to retrieve their property.
TTW00009435	I need to find a doctor in the Wasteland to perform facial reconstruction. I also need someone who knows a great deal about computers.
TTW00009436	I used to think Rivet City was such a safe place.
TTW00009437	I heard a lot of them got away and made it to the Citadel. I hope the Enclave leaves us alone.
TTW00009438	MQ11LDPrimeLines
TTW00009439	Warning: Forcible impact alert. Scanning for Chinese artillery.
TTW00009440	Revised stratagem: Initiate photonic resonance overcharge.
TTW00009441	I know what you did. Vance told me everything.
TTW00009442	Then you must think I'm some kind of a monster.
TTW00009443	Get a hold of yourself!
TTW00009444	Don't you understand me? I killed them, okay?! My mother and father are dead because of me!
TTW00009445	It was the fucking hunger. That thing that's haunted me my entire life!
TTW00009446	I killed them! My own parents!
TTW00009447	It was the fucking hunger. That thing that's haunted me my entire life!
TTW00009448	You must think I'm some sort of monster.
TTW00009449	I'm here to take you home, Ian.
TTW00009450	Home? I don't have a home anymore. I made sure of that, didn't I?
TTW00009451	Hey, I'm just here to help. All I want to do is be someone he can talk to.
TTW00009452	Well, I guess so. You seem like a pretty nice guy.
TTW00009453	Vance will have my butt in a sling if he finds out, but let me give you the password to his room.
TTW00009454	Come on, all I want to do is talk. What harm could little old me do?
TTW00009455	Well, I guess so. You seem like a pretty nice guy.
TTW00009456	Vance will have my butt in a sling if he finds out, but let me give you the password to his room.
TTW00009457	Hey, hot stuff. Why don't you tell me how I can see Ian?
TTW00009458	Now that's more like it! I finally won't have to pay for it anymore. Ha ha ha!
TTW00009459	My oh my, that would be tempting. If you were that good, maybe I'd pay you! Ha ha ha.
TTW00009460	Are you telling me that Ian is a cannibal?
TTW00009461	The hunger that drives us must be kept in check. It is one of the most difficult things to teach.
TTW00009462	Ian lost control because no one was around to guide him. His own family was alien to him.
TTW00009463	Damn it, Vance! What did you do to him?
TTW00009464	Because of my intervention that night he stopped just short of being lost forever to his cravings for flesh.
TTW00009465	Because of my intervention that night he stopped just short of being lost forever to his cravings for flesh.
TTW00009466	A cannibal by any other name is still a cannibal.
TTW00009467	That is completely untrue. Your difficulty grasping the concept that change is possible in my people perplexes me. Let me try a different approach.
TTW00009468	Let me counter that ignorance with a lesson in objectivity. I say we are no longer cannibal, only consuming the blood of our prey.
TTW00009469	What would that make us in your eyes?
TTW00009470	Your people eat human flesh, Vance. That's sick!
TTW00009471	That is correct my arrogant friend, but you are missing the grand picture I'm afraid.
TTW00009472	Let me counter that ignorance with a lesson in objectivity. I say we are no longer cannibal, only consuming the blood of our prey.
TTW00009473	What would that make us in your eyes?
TTW00009474	If I accept that you're no longer cannibals, what do I call you?
TTW00009475	Your open mindedness is very rare for a human. I find that fascinating.
TTW00009476	Allow me to bolster your insight with a lesson in objectivity. I say we are no longer cannibal, only consuming the blood of our prey.
TTW00009477	What would that make us in your eyes?
TTW00009478	Let me see what you have.
TTW00009479	Sure! Take a look around!
TTW00009480	You say that now, but you might end up reconsidering that when you're surrounded by radscorpions.
TTW00009481	But if you do, and you're still alive to find me again, the offer'll still stand.
TTW00009482	I'll pass. I don't need a crazy, robotic soldier following me around.
TTW00009483	That's a hard bargain. But if I wake up with that thing playing revelry at me one more time, I'll go insane.
TTW00009484	I'll just transfer the codes, and you've got a deal, friend. Here's hoping for the best for you and the Sergeant alike!
TTW00009485	How about this: I'll take him off your hands for 500 caps.
TTW00009486	I'll just transfer the codes, and you've got a deal, friend. Here's hoping for the best for you and the Sergeant alike!
TTW00009487	1,000 caps is a lot, but I'll take him.
TTW00009488	Well now, that's a problem. But start saving now and maybe I'll run into you again, huh?
TTW00009489	Sounds like a good buy, but I haven't got the caps.
TTW00009490	Trust me, friend, Tinker Joe does not turn down the opportunity to make a sale. If that Gutsy would go with you, I'd sell him in a heartbeat.
TTW00009491	It's just that his programming's a bit off. He won't travel with anyone he considers "too extreme."
TTW00009492	And sadly, his version of "too extreme" seems to cover both sides of the coin - slavers and saints alike. Sorry, pal.
TTW00009493	You just don't want to sell to me, is that it?
TTW00009494	Trust me, friend, Tinker Joe does not turn down the opportunity to make a sale. If that Gutsy would go with you, I'd sell him in a heartbeat.
TTW00009495	It's just that his programming's a bit off. He won't travel with anyone he considers "too extreme."
TTW00009496	And sadly, his version of "too extreme" seems to cover both sides of the coin - slavers and saints alike. Sorry, pal.
TTW00009497	You just don't want to sell to me, is that it?
TTW00009498	Trust me, friend, Tinker Joe does not turn down the opportunity to make a sale. If that Gutsy would go with you, I'd sell him in a heartbeat.
TTW00009499	It's just that his programming's a bit off. He won't travel with anyone he considers "too extreme."
TTW00009500	You're going to have to let your other friend go. Until then, I'll hold on to him for you.
TTW00009501	You just don't want to sell to me, is that it?
TTW00009502	To tell the truth, it is a little trouble. But he can't help the way he got built.
TTW00009503	So we got a gung-ho, robotic soldier that's picky about the company he keeps. But he seems to like you, so it'll be fine.
TTW00009504	"Simulated personality"? Sounds like trouble.
TTW00009505	Hey, I said it was a beaut of a deal, didn't I?
TTW00009506	But to tell the truth, RL-3's a bit picky about the company he keeps, and he won't let himself get sold to just anyone.
TTW00009507	Makes him a bit of a tough lot to sell, if you know what I mean. But he seems to like you, so I'm not gonna complain!
TTW00009508	That's a lot of caps, but I guess it's a pretty rare find.
TTW00009509	Hey, I said it was a beaut of a deal, didn't I?
TTW00009510	But to tell the truth, RL-3's a bit picky about the company he keeps, and he won't let himself get sold to just anyone.
TTW00009511	Makes him a bit of a tough lot to sell, if you know what I mean. But he seems to like you, so I'm not gonna complain!
TTW00009512	That's a lot of caps, but I guess it's a pretty rare find.
TTW00009513	General Atomics International programmed him to be a perfect soldier, and his simulated personality is designed to follow strict codes of conduct.
TTW00009514	It's just that some of those codes were a little less-defined than others. So he won't travel with anyone he considers "too extreme."
TTW00009515	And sadly, his version of "too extreme" seems to cover both sides of the coin - slavers and saints alike. Sorry, pal.
TTW00009516	A picky robot? How does that work?
TTW00009517	I'd like to buy a robot.
TTW00009518	Of course you would, of course! Well, it just happens that I've got a beaut of a deal on this customized Gutsy.
TTW00009519	Comes complete with a simulated personality unit, so he's good protection and good company, too! And all yours for just 1000 caps.
TTW00009520	Of course you would, of course! Well, it just happens that I've got a beaut of a deal on this customized Gutsy.
TTW00009521	Comes complete with a simulated personality unit, so he's good protection and good company, too! And all yours for just 1000 caps.
TTW00009522	Well, RL-3's a bit finicky about the company he keeps. And I don't think he likes the look of you. Nothing personal, of course.
TTW00009523	Yeah. Seems like everyone's having a good time.
TTW00009524	Sure. Will there be games, though?
TTW00009525	Did you know that Paulie Cantelli is an addict?
TTW00009526	Yeah. He comes by every night around closing time and tries to get Cindy to let him close up.
TTW00009527	Thank God she's smarter than that.
TTW00009528	Relax. I'm just looking around.
TTW00009529	Oh. Okay. Well, let me know if you want anything. To buy, that is.
TTW00009530	Oh. Okay. Well, stop by if you want anything. To buy, that is.
TTW00009531	This place is a real dump.
TTW00009532	No, and enough with the third degree already!
TTW00009533	This has to be the work of the Family! I've caught that weirdo leader of theirs talking to Ian down by the river.
TTW00009534	Nope, and it's unlikely they left him alive.
TTW00009535	What am I gonna do? The Wests' lives were my responsibility and look what happened!
TTW00009536	This has to be the work of the Family! I've caught weirdo leader of theirs talking to Ian down by the river.
TTW00009537	No, I only found the parents' bodies.
TTW00009538	This has to be the work of the Family! I've caught that weirdo leader of theirs talking to Ian down by the river.
TTW00009539	You're listening to the adventures of me, Herbert "Daring" Dashwood, and my stalwart Ghoul manservant Argyle!
TTW00009540	You're listening to the adventures of me, Herbert "Daring" Dashwood, and my stalwart Ghoul manservant Argyle!
TTW00009541	You're listening to the adventures of me, Herbert "Daring" Dashwood, and my stalwart Ghoul manservant Argyle!
TTW00009542	You're listening to the adventures of me, Herbert "Daring" Dashwood, and my stalwart Ghoul manservant Argyle!
TTW00009543	Penelope Chase, fortune hunter. You can buy me a beer later. Now let's cut this shindig short and get the bloody hell out of here! Come on!
TTW00009544	Know anything else that could help me stop them?
TTW00009545	No way! Don't stop them! They're awesome!
TTW00009546	Unless maybe you're going to be a super-hero, too!
TTW00009547	No way! Don't stop them! They're awesome!
TTW00009548	Unless maybe you're going to be a super-hero, too!
TTW00009549	What can you tell me about the Mechanist?
TTW00009550	I knew the Mechanist back when he was just a normal-hero. He used to be called Scott, and he fixed up stuff around town!
TTW00009551	But one day, the AntAgonizer killed his favorite robot, and I told him he ought to fight back against her like a real super-hero!
TTW00009552	Ever since then, he's been up on his Forge in the back of the robot shop on the hill, working to protect us all from the AntAgonizer!
TTW00009553	What is this place?
TTW00009554	It's the last place I ever expected to end up.
TTW00009555	But don't tell Vance I said that.
TTW00009556	I think I'll tough it out.
TTW00009557	Suit yourself. But you'll find out that your habit will cost you more than that in the end.
TTW00009558	Suit yourself. But you'll find out that your habit will cost you more than that in the end.
TTW00009559	Suit yourself. But you'll find out that your habit will cost you more than that in the end.
TTW00009560	Yes, cure me.
TTW00009561	I'll be glad to help when you can afford the treatment.
TTW00009562	I don't have 50 caps.
TTW00009563	Come back when you actually have the money, you damn junkie.
TTW00009564	I don't have 50 caps.
TTW00009565	Okay, there you are. The convulsions should stop in the next one to twelve weeks. If they don't, try holding on to something that's very still.
TTW00009566	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
TTW00009567	Why didn't you say so? No problem. I'll give you my free cure. Here, lean in. It's a special doctor secret.
TTW00009568	Stop doing chems!
TTW00009569	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
TTW00009570	There, that's got it. Don't be so eager to sample dangerous substances in the future, okay?
TTW00009571	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
TTW00009572	My supplies are rather limited, and we can only get more by trading. Which requires money. Money you don't have. Come back when you have some.
TTW00009573	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
TTW00009574	Okay... all done.
TTW00009575	I think I might be addicted to something.
TTW00009576	I can give you something that should help.
TTW00009577	The treatment costs 50 caps. Even most outsiders should be able to afford it.
TTW00009578	I can take care of it for you, for a price.
TTW00009579	That'll be 50 caps. Maybe the dent in your pocketbook will keep you away from that crap.
TTW00009580	I swear, you and Zip, just full of your own little chemical problems, aren't you?
TTW00009581	Here, hold on. I've got you covered.
TTW00009582	I think I might be addicted to something. Can you help?
TTW00009583	And here I thought Zip's soda problem was bad.
TTW00009584	For 50 caps, I can help you get over that. Otherwise, you can find your own solution.
TTW00009585	I think I might be addicted to something. Can you help?
TTW00009586	I thought you had the look about you. Sure, I can help you. But it's not free. 50 caps, take it or leave it.
TTW00009587	I'm just glad you're willing to get help. But the treatment isn't free. I'll need 50 caps for the drugs.
TTW00009588	I thought you had the look about you. Sure, I can help you. But it's not free. 50 caps, take it or leave it.
TTW00009589	Could you repair my equipment?
TTW00009590	Could I? Yes. Will I? No. Go see Peabody or Bowditch.
TTW00009591	Do you think you could repair my equipment?
TTW00009592	We'll kill more with two of us.
TTW00009593	Fine. Let's get out of here.
TTW00009594	Yeah, well what do you know? I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna have the biggest, toughest gang ever!
TTW00009595	What? A goody-two-shoes like you could never make it in a real gang!
TTW00009596	You want to hang with a Tunnel Snake like me, you gotta be hard.
TTW00009597	You could join forces with me, if you'd like.
TTW00009598	Ride with me, and we can rampage across the Wasteland.
TTW00009599	I really wish I could, man, but three's a crowd, you know? I'll just stay here for now.
TTW00009600	Tunnel Snakes rule!
TTW00009601	Come along with me, and we'll make an awesome gang.
TTW00009602	Tunnel Snakes rule!
TTW00009603	Come along with me, and we'll make an awesome gang.
TTW00009604	Then good luck finding someone who'd risk their life for yours. Not something a sane person would do these days, is it?
TTW00009605	No deal. I like my bodyguards sane.
TTW00009606	Any time you need some company, she'll be here.
TTW00009607	I wish I could take her now. Maybe later.
TTW00009608	Trust me, she's worth every cap.
TTW00009609	Guess I'll have to save up for her.
TTW00009610	Come with me, dog. It'll be good to have some company out here.
TTW00009611	<bark> <bark> <bark!>
TTW00009612	I could use a pet like you. Let's go find something to eat, mutt.
TTW00009613	<growl!>
TTW00009614	I can be your new master. Would you like that, boy?
TTW00009615	<bark!> <bark!> <bark!>
TTW00009616	Gotta be careful, using a slave as a bodyguard. Most aren't exactly motivated to keep you alive, you know what I mean?
TTW00009617	I'm in the market for a bodyguard like yours. You selling?
TTW00009618	My friend, I would be honored to follow a hero such as yourself. Shall we go?
TTW00009619	I could always use a hand. Would you like to follow me?
TTW00009620	It seems I didn't know you as well as I had thought. My mistake.
TTW00009621	I've read about a museum of history in the south. Perhaps I can learn more about the world there, without facing such enmity.
TTW00009622	I will take my leave of you. Goodbye, my rescuer.
TTW00009623	I was in that situation once, myself. Deal with it.
TTW00009624	I appreciate the offer, but I must decline. I have an entire world to explore, and I must not be delayed any further.
TTW00009625	I have read about a great museum of history to the south. Perhaps I will head there.
TTW00009626	Goodbye, my friend. Perhaps I will join you in the future, if your goals are virtuous enough to draw me away.
TTW00009627	I could always use a hand. Would you like to follow me?
TTW00009628	My friend, I would be honored to follow a hero such as yourself. Shall we go?
TTW00009629	I could always use a hand. Would you like to follow me?
TTW00009630	Go away! I'm not opening the door until the lockdown's over.
TTW00009631	This isn't rocket science. I know exactly what you are.
TTW00009632	You amaze me. Never have I met a human with the gift of cognition that you possess.
TTW00009633	Tell me then, what are we?
TTW00009634	I'm not here to take sides, just to make sure Vance hasn't omitted any facts.
TTW00009635	I'd never thought of it that way. I suppose he should get a chance to talk to someone like you.
TTW00009636	Here's the password to his isolation area. Just please don't mention my name to Vance about this.
TTW00009637	You always have had a knack for making me feel better.
TTW00009638	What are you doing in Underworld?
TTW00009639	Sure, take a look.
TTW00009640	I'd like to buy some ammo from you.
TTW00009641	Did you look? Did you really look? You can't just look with your eyes, you know.
TTW00009642	You think he really looks like that little girl? He hides things. Confuses them. You have to find a way to find it.
TTW00009643	Sounds like a deal. Here you go.
TTW00009644	You drive a hard bargain, but it's worth every cap.
TTW00009645	Will you give me 100 caps for it?
TTW00009646	Sounds like a deal. Here you go.
TTW00009647	You drive a hard bargain, but it's worth every cap.
TTW00009648	Will you give me 125 caps for it?
TTW00009649	Gob!
TTW00009650	Well, that's been a long time coming. Good riddance.
TTW00009651	Want to come with me? It's dangerous out here all alone.
TTW00009652	<pant> <pant>
TTW00009653	Stay here, boy. Don't move until I come back!
TTW00009654	<whine>
TTW00009655	Okay, I'll leave. You stay here.
TTW00009656	<whimper>
TTW00009657	You're welcome.
TTW00009658	Well, you kept your promise. I really didn't think you would. Thank you.
TTW00009659	Follow me.
TTW00009660	The sooner we get there, the better.
TTW00009661	Wait here.
TTW00009662	Don't be gone too long.
TTW00009663	I don't have 100 caps.
TTW00009664	All right kid. Then I guess there's nothing else we have to say to each other. Come back to me when you have the caps, and we'll talk.
TTW00009665	You'd better calm down, before I put you down.
TTW00009666	That lying bastard. Roped you into finding me too, huh?
TTW00009667	Well, you're not getting a damn thing from me! You hear me?! Not a damn thing!
TTW00009668	That sack of shit is convinced that I'm some crazy junkie who stole money from him!
TTW00009669	Who's Moriarty?
TTW00009670	That sack of shit is convinced that I'm some crazy junkie who stole money from him!
TTW00009671	Yes, and he says you owe him some caps.
TTW00009672	Look, I need a way to get some caps or I'll never have the money to pay you.
TTW00009673	Good. I hope she got what she deserved.
TTW00009674	I took care of Silver for you.
TTW00009675	Mister Crowley wants that key. Now.
TTW00009676	What key? Oh, that key.
TTW00009677	You're a moron. I don't have any of his precious keys. Idiot.
TTW00009678	Help!
TTW00009679	No, you'll need it more than I will.
TTW00009680	You're right. It's dangerous out here.
TTW00009681	I'll take that. Now get out of here.
TTW00009682	You're a liar, Moriarty. I know where I grew up.
TTW00009683	"All hail the Overseer! We're born in the Vault, we die in the Vault!" And all that other assorted lunacy.
TTW00009684	You're wrong. My Dad never would have lied to me.
TTW00009685	'All hail the Overseer! We're born in the Vault; we die in the Vault!' And all that other assorted lunacy.
TTW00009686	Oh, I wasn't born in the Vault? That's complete bullshit, and you know it.
TTW00009687	'All hail the Overseer! We're born in the Vault; we die in the Vault!' And all that other assorted lunacy.
TTW00009688	'All hail the Overseer! We're born in the Vault; we die in the Vault!' And all that other assorted lunacy.
TTW00009689	Stay here. Maybe I'll come back for you.
TTW00009690	<whine>
TTW00009691	<whine>
TTW00009692	I can't take you right now, stay here. I'll come back for you.
TTW00009693	You mentioned something about Galaxy News Radio?
TTW00009694	Well, the Brotherhood needed a secure outpost, and the guy who runs the radio station needed to not get his head ripped off by Super Mutants.
TTW00009695	It's a mutually beneficial relationship.
TTW00009696	Anything else you can tell me about GNR?
TTW00009697	Who did you say you were again?
TTW00009698	I'll take that as a compliment.
TTW00009699	If we don't try to keep the mutants from killing everyone and everything in the Capital Wasteland, who will?
TTW00009700	Wow. You guys don't screw around.
TTW00009701	Do you have anything for sale?
TTW00009702	Sure, have a look.
TTW00009703	Things are pretty good with Meyers watching over us. I can give you a little bit of a discount.
TTW00009704	Yep, and I got more ammunition now that the NCR keeps supplies flowing in.
TTW00009705	On the other hand I'm payin' them NCR taxes, so now you got to as well.
TTW00009706	It's Irving.
TTW00009707	Hahahaha! Irving! Are you serious?
TTW00009708	Here's the pool. You earned it!
TTW00009709	You're tough to find.
TTW00009710	Maybe that's because I don't want to be found.
TTW00009711	I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you're here. I figured Evan King would get someone to track me down sooner or later.
TTW00009712	Evan King sent me to look for you.
TTW00009713	Yeah, I guess I should have known this would happen.
TTW00009714	Ha ha! You talk a lot! Sound funny when you talk, like a stupid human. Ha ha ha ha ha!
TTW00009715	I have joke for you. Ready? Knock knock.
TTW00009716	Power armor, energy weapons, and all sorts of advanced technology. Even some junk like sensor units or spare parts can be useful.
TTW00009717	Some of it goes into the archives, some of it gets used to repair our own gear. Either way, it's better in our hands than lying around out there.
TTW00009718	What are you looking for, again?
TTW00009719	You've definitely proven your worth. I'll make sure to tell our people on patrol that you're a friend of the Outcasts.
TTW00009720	So, are we good? You trust me enough now?
TTW00009721	Useful stuff out there. Hope you don't have to use too much.
TTW00009722	I'll take Rad-Away.
TTW00009723	Can't stand this stuff, myself. Goes through me like a rampaging Brahmin.
TTW00009724	I'll take Rad-Away.
TTW00009725	Here. Everyone's favorite. What would we do without them?
TTW00009726	I'll take Stimpaks.
TTW00009727	Here, enjoy them in good health. Or, at least, when you'd like to be in good health.
TTW00009728	I'll take Stimpaks.
TTW00009729	Be careful. These can pack quite a pop.
TTW00009730	I'll take Frag Grenades.
TTW00009731	Always a popular choice, these. Enjoy.
TTW00009732	I'll take Frag Grenades.
TTW00009733	Here you go. Try not to use it all in one place, unless you have to.
TTW00009734	I'll take 5.56 ammo.
TTW00009735	Here's hoping you don't have to use it. But who am I kidding?
TTW00009736	I'll take 5.56 ammo.
TTW00009737	It's practically junk, but we can get some use out of it.
TTW00009738	How'd you like your payment?
TTW00009739	I've got some spare parts for you.
TTW00009740	It's practically junk, but we can get some use out of it.
TTW00009741	How'd you like your payment?
TTW00009742	I've got a sensor unit for you.
TTW00009743	Interesting. Very interesting.
TTW00009744	This definitely bears some study. Now, how would you like your payment?
TTW00009745	Here, I found some Alien Power Cells.
TTW00009746	What in the world?
TTW00009747	Yes, I think the boys down in the lab would be very interested in this. You did right to bring this to us!
TTW00009748	Now, what would you like in return for this amazing find?
TTW00009749	You'll like this. It's an Alien Blaster. Seriously.
TTW00009750	Pretty rare piece of equipment, this. Good find.
TTW00009751	How'd you like your payment?
TTW00009752	I've got a Plasma Pistol for you.
TTW00009753	Pretty rare piece of equipment, this. Good find.
TTW00009754	How'd you like your payment?
TTW00009755	I've got a Plasma Rifle for you.
TTW00009756	We can always use another one of these.
TTW00009757	How'd you like your payment?
TTW00009758	How about a Laser Pistol?
TTW00009759	We can always use another one of these.
TTW00009760	How'd you like your payment?
TTW00009761	How about a Laser Rifle?
TTW00009762	This is some pretty heavy-duty stuff. We'll take good care of it.
TTW00009763	Now, what can I give you in return?
TTW00009764	Here's a Power Armor Helmet from the Enclave.
TTW00009765	Well I'll be damned. The Advanced Power Armor Mark II. This is superb. Absolutely superb.
TTW00009766	Now, what can I give you in return?
TTW00009767	Here's some Power Armor from the Enclave.
TTW00009768	You'd better believe it. I haven't seen a suit like this in a long time.
TTW00009769	And what would you like for this little surprise?
TTW00009770	This Tesla Armor might be of interest to you.
TTW00009771	Not much good on its own, but the optics are useful, at least.
TTW00009772	How'd you like your payment?
TTW00009773	Take this Power Armor Helmet.
TTW00009774	Always good to have another of these in the vaults.
TTW00009775	How'd you like your payment?
TTW00009776	Take this suit of Power Armor.
TTW00009777	I see you've got some of our Power Armor there. I'll just take that off your hands.
TTW00009778	I'm sure you just found it in the Wastes and you're returning it to us, right? Because you'd have to be a real moron to try to turn it in for pay.
TTW00009779	Now, let's see what else you've got.
TTW00009780	I've got some technology to turn in.
TTW00009781	Let's see what you've got.
TTW00009782	I've got some technology to turn in.
TTW00009783	Suit yourself. Why don't you go talk with Lyons? He's always got time for your kind.
TTW00009784	I'll pass. If I can't be a member, I won't be your errand runner.
TTW00009785	Okay, but first you'll have to talk with Protector Casdin. You can work out the details with him.
TTW00009786	Sounds good. I'm in.
TTW00009787	It's simple enough. Bring in technological devices, and we'll pay you for what you find.
TTW00009788	Big things like power armor or energy weapons are best, but we'll take things like sensor units or spare parts, too. You never know what's important.
TTW00009789	In return, we'll pay you with your choice of 5.56 ammo, grenades, stimpaks, or Rad-Away. I'll bet they're more useful to you out there, anyway.
TTW00009790	I need to know more about the job before deciding.
TTW00009791	Why are you here in the Capital Wasteland?
TTW00009792	Well, that depends on who you ask.
TTW00009793	Lyons will tell you it's because we're protecting the poor, innocent people of the Capital Wasteland.
TTW00009794	Most others here will tell you the same thing. They'll do anything for that man.
TTW00009795	What was all that about? Who were those people?
TTW00009796	A while ago, we were attacked by the AntAgonizer - that woman with the ants, obviously. The Mechanist saved the town with his robots.
TTW00009797	That was all well and good, but I swear their fights are getting bigger, and it's been driving off the merchants. They simply won't leave!
TTW00009798	Mirelurk gives me gas. I'd rather have squirrel.
TTW00009799	Bannon is trying to blackmail Seagraves Holmes.
TTW00009800	That's pretty underhanded, even for Bannon.
TTW00009801	Once word gets out, I bet the market vendors won't want him to represent them anymore.
TTW00009802	Thank you for your help, citizen.
TTW00009803	Whoever this Seagrave is, you think he's a threat to your influence?
TTW00009804	A threat? No, of course not! Well, maybe. He wants to replace me on the council.
TTW00009805	Well, let's just say I would be very appreciative.
TTW00009806	Seagrave? Oh yeah. He's clueless.
TTW00009807	So you've met him, eh? Well he wants to replace me on the council. Now, I can't have that. No siree.
TTW00009808	Well, let's just say I would be very appreciative.
TTW00009809	Sounds like a plan, man.
TTW00009810	All right! You and me, just hangin'.
TTW00009811	Aren't you afraid someone will use your own guns to rob you?
TTW00009812	Here? In Rivet City?
TTW00009813	I'm packing and most of the rest of these guys are packing. Not to mention security.
TTW00009814	This is quite a selection, but they're all in lousy condition.
TTW00009815	I don't put the good stuff out on the table. If you're interested, I can show you the stuff in the locker.
TTW00009816	So what happened to Project Purity?
TTW00009817	In the year before you were born, things became difficult.
TTW00009818	There had always been something of a "mutants problem" in the city, but it became worse. They attacked more frequently, and more aggressively.
TTW00009819	Support for the project eroded as time went on, when we couldn't produce any significant results. Progress came to a halt. And then you were born.
TTW00009820	From what I understand, things happened quickly after that. It became too dangerous for the others to stay, and so the project was abandoned.
TTW00009821	Doctor Li and her team left for what became Rivet City, and Project Purity has sat waiting ever since.
TTW00009822	What exactly is this "Project Purity"?
TTW00009823	It started as an idea, really. Remember the Bible passage your mother loved so much?
TTW00009824	Free, clean water for everyone. What a difference it could make in the lives of everyone here in the Wastes.
TTW00009825	Over time, that idea took the form of a purifier. Not like the one in the Vault, though.
TTW00009826	This one was gigantic, capable of purifying millions of gallons of water at once.
TTW00009827	We used the old Jefferson Memorial for the location, right on D.C.'s Tidal Basin. Someday soon, I hope you'll see it work.
TTW00009828	I've got some stuff that needs repairs.
TTW00009829	Sure, I can fix most anything. Let me see what you've got.
TTW00009830	Pain is your friend.
TTW00009831	I'll go for the armor.
TTW00009832	The armor it is. Wear it with pride, kid. We do.
TTW00009833	Consider this place your home away from home. If you're ever in the neighborhood again, you're more than welcome to take shelter here.
TTW00009834	I guess that does it. See you 'round, kid.
TTW00009835	HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
TTW00009836	FATHER! NO!
TTW00009837	Why did you kill that bartender?
TTW00009838	He put water in my vodka to make more caps from me. Make the drink weak and try to charge me more!
TTW00009839	Maybe the next bartender, he won't be stupid, eh? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
TTW00009840	Curious. Many years ago, I survived by drinking from fresh bloodpacks I recovered from hospital ruins.
TTW00009841	The problem was that these bloodpacks were scarce.
TTW00009842	What do you propose?
TTW00009843	Let me see your Chems.
TTW00009844	Yeah, I got some stuff around here. But it'll cost you.
TTW00009845	You know where I can buy some chems around here?
TTW00009846	Right on. Thanks.
TTW00009847	No problem at all.
TTW00009848	Hey, thanks. Keep it coming.
TTW00009849	If it means that much to you, I'll take it.
TTW00009850	Please, keep doing what you do.
TTW00009851	Okay, let's get this over with. Cycle the airlock, will you?
TTW00009852	Nice gun. I've never seen one like that.
TTW00009853	Yeah, it is nice. I don't even sleep without it under my pillow.
TTW00009854	My father made gun ammunition for a living. Taught me everything about how firearms work.
TTW00009855	So, I've spent my downtime tinkering with guns like my 10mm Ultra SMG here. It's like a hobby I guess.
TTW00009856	So, whatever happened to your father?
TTW00009857	What?!
TTW00009858	I can't believe you brought this to me. I don't know what to say but thank you.
TTW00009859	Wait! Here, take my 10mm Ultra SMG. It's never let me down. Besides, I won't really need it anymore.
TTW00009860	Sydney, I found a note from your father. He didn't abandon you.
TTW00009861	Anything you can tell me about the Super Mutants?
TTW00009862	In all that time, all we've managed to do is to contain the threat. Hold them back, so they don't overrun every blasted settlement out here.
TTW00009863	But we don't really "know" anything. Where they're from, why they've infested the D.C. ruins.
TTW00009864	I'll give you the suit. No one ever has to see the AntAgonizer again. Just please, let me have another chance.
TTW00009865	I read that the AntAgonizer was an orphaned girl who could still be redeemed.
TTW00009866	Why did you damage me? You're supposed to be a healing robot!
TTW00009867	There has been an error in the medical subsystem. Please run a level two diagnostic.
TTW00009868	What do you make of the Enclave, Squire?
TTW00009869	And some of their technology is amazing! Vertibirds! Plasma weapons that can turn a man to goo!
TTW00009870	I don't suppose you know anything about the Super Mutants?
TTW00009871	Oh yes! I've studied them quite a bit since I've been here!
TTW00009872	But the worst of all? The Behemoth! He's a giant! I saw one once, outside the Citadel walls. Sooo scary.
TTW00009873	The Super Mutants are all over the city ruins, but Elder Lyons doesn't actually think they're from there, or we would have found their home by now.
TTW00009874	It kind of seems like they're looking for something, but we're not really sure what that is.
TTW00009875	I need medical supplies.
TTW00009876	I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
TTW00009877	Yeah, and I need sterile medical supplies. But let's see what I have with me.
TTW00009878	Sure.
TTW00009879	I guess I can spare a few things.
TTW00009880	Hmm... well, I am better set for supplies now that you helped me out. I guess I can part with some of them.
TTW00009881	Here's what I've got.
TTW00009882	I suppose I have a few things around that I can spare.
TTW00009883	Hey, can you hook me up with some chems?
TTW00009884	Sure sure. I got it all. Check it out.
TTW00009885	Sure thing, man. Sure thing.
TTW00009886	Care to share anything about the Super Mutants?
TTW00009887	Why do you think I ride these Initiates so hard? I make training hell so fighting those Uglies won't be.
TTW00009888	There's meat under that armor, and meat can be ground.
TTW00009889	Targets confirmed westbound. Move to intercept.
TTW00009890	Fine. I'll practice on someone else. Thanks for nothing.
TTW00009891	Tell you what. Let's hook up later and go see Scribe Bowditch. I heard he's been working on some new Power Armor mods. Can't hurt.
TTW00009892	He's working in a bar in Megaton.
TTW00009893	Oh, that's wonderful news! I'm so glad! If you see him, please tell him that his mother misses him and loves him and that I hope he's happy.
TTW00009894	But, he shouldn't come visit. It's too dangerous. No, no. He should stay put where he is.
TTW00009895	All right. I'm going to go have a look around.
TTW00009896	We've got a nice little deal going on down here. We'd like to keep it nice.
TTW00009897	Enclave strength is at 100%. They're getting reinforcements from somewhere, but we still haven't determined the location of their headquarters.
TTW00009898	There's been another Behemoth sighted in the Wasteland, in the Evergreen Mills region. That's heavy Raider country, so things could get interesting.
TTW00009899	It appears the Enclave troops have moved beyond the purifier, into the surrounding Wasteland region. No telling how far they might spread.
TTW00009900	All right, Rothchild. Fire it up. Pride, move out!
TTW00009901	Wait a second! I handled Silver for you, and you still want me to pay?
TTW00009902	It's called economics, kid. You got something I want and I got something you want. Nothing's free.
TTW00009903	I told you the favor would earn you some caps if you really took care of it. Now, fork 'em over!
TTW00009904	Production threat identified. Initializing program: Excalibur.
TTW00009905	Please stand clear and go about your normal work routine. Your friendly RobCo Factory Helper will have this cleaned up in a moment.
TTW00009906	This disturbance will be credited towards your daily break allotment. Thank you.
TTW00009907	Due to an unforseen incident you have been issued an unpaid holiday. Enjoy.
TTW00009908	Please stand clear and keep the palaver to a minimum. Thank you.
TTW00009909	Get outta my head!
TTW00009910	Greetings fellow employee. Please present your valid work ID.
TTW00009911	No valid ID detected. Please state name clearly for voice identification.
TTW00009912	Unidentified personnel. Please vacate the premises immediately.
TTW00009913	Can I see what you have to trade?
TTW00009914	Sure. Just be quick about it.
TTW00009915	On second thought, stick with me for a little longer.
TTW00009916	Excellent. Will do.
TTW00009917	On second thought, stay with me.
TTW00009918	Very amusing.
TTW00009919	Nah. I'm just kidding.
TTW00009920	Yeah, very funny. Ha ha. Hilarious.
TTW00009921	Nah. I'm just kidding.
TTW00009922	Very well. I shall stay with you.
TTW00009923	On second thought, stay with me.
TTW00009924	Yeah. That's what I thought.
TTW00009925	On second thought, stay with me.
TTW00009926	I was worried for a second.
TTW00009927	On second thought, stay with me.
TTW00009928	Very well.
TTW00009929	No, I'm not. Stay here.
TTW00009930	Yes, I'm sure.
TTW00009931	I'm serious.
TTW00009932	You can't fire me! I'm the boss of this gang! And I say you're fired! Suck on that!
TTW00009933	I'm serious.
TTW00009934	Very well. Although you remain my employer until my contract changes hands. I will wait for you should you need me again.
TTW00009935	Do I look like I'm kidding?
TTW00009936	If that's the way you're going to play, lover.
TTW00009937	Because I say so. Go.
TTW00009938	<whimper>
TTW00009939	You heard me. Get out of here.
TTW00009940	I see how it is, the old man can't keep up. Whatever.
TTW00009941	Don't make me repeat myself.
TTW00009942	I'm disappointed, but I cannot say I'm surprised. If you change your mind I shall be, uhhh studying downtown.
TTW00009943	Yes, I'm certain.
TTW00009944	Leaving a soldier behind? Very bad form.
TTW00009945	You didn't mishear me. Leave.
TTW00009946	Very well.
TTW00009947	We must part ways, Paladin Cross.
TTW00009948	Very well. Although you remain my employer until my contract changes hands. I will wait for you in Underworld, should you need me again.
TTW00009949	Do I look like I'm kidding?
TTW00009950	If that's the way you're going to play, lover. I'll be waiting at Eulogy's place when you come crawling back.
TTW00009951	Because I say so. Go.
TTW00009952	<whimper>
TTW00009953	You heard me. Get out of here.
TTW00009954	I see how it is: the old man can't keep up. Whatever. I'm gonna go see if there's anything left of Megaton.
TTW00009955	Don't make me repeat myself.
TTW00009956	I see how it is, the old man can't keep up. Whatever. I'll be at Moriarty's if you change your mind.
TTW00009957	Don't make me repeat myself.
TTW00009958	I'm disappointed, but I cannot say I'm surprised. If you change your mind, I shall be studying in the American History Museum, downtown.
TTW00009959	Yes, I'm certain.
TTW00009960	Leaving a soldier behind? Very bad form. Making base in Canterbury Commons for when you come to your senses, sir!
TTW00009961	You didn't mishear me. Leave.
TTW00009962	Very well. I shall return to my duties at the Citadel should you require my aid once again.
TTW00009963	We must part ways, Paladin Cross.
TTW00009964	That's why you're the boss. You always make the right decisions. I'll just head home. Home to my lonely, abandoned shack in the middle of nowhere.
TTW00009965	I think it's for the best.
TTW00009966	You're the boss, boss.
TTW00009967	I think it's for the best.
TTW00009968	<Makes beeping sounds>
TTW00009969	<Companion Protocol::End Companion Protocol>
TTW00009970	<Makes beeping sounds>
TTW00009971	<Companion Protocol::End Companion Protocol>
TTW00009972	<Makes beeping sounds>
TTW00009973	<Companion Protocol::End Companion Protocol>
TTW00009974	Okay. Then I guess I'll be back at the 188. Maybe digging in some dirt for scrap metal or something.
TTW00009975	I just think we should right now.
TTW00009976	Don't take too long, all right?
TTW00009977	I just think we should right now.
TTW00009978	<whimper>
TTW00009979	<whimper>
TTW00009980	Fine then.
TTW00009981	I'll get out of your hair, then.
TTW00009982	Fine then.
TTW00009983	I'll get out of your hair, then.
TTW00009984	All right, then, dearie. Now you promise to come visit grandma soon, you hear?
TTW00009985	I'll miss you too, Lily, but it's time.
TTW00009986	All right, then, dearie. Now you promise to come visit grandma soon, you hear?
TTW00009987	I'll miss you too, Lily, but it's time.
TTW00009988	All right. Guess I'll be around Novac for a while longer, until I figure out what I want to do with myself. See you around.
TTW00009989	Yeah, that's what I think. You should head back home.
TTW00009990	All right.
TTW00009991	Yeah, that's what I think. You should head back home.
TTW00009992	I'll head back to the Old Mormon Fort. If you need me, just swing by.
TTW00009993	I'll defer to your judgment, naturally.
TTW00009994	I found Argyle. I'm afraid he's dead.
TTW00009995	But thank you! Thank you for telling me. At least now I know. At least now the poor guy can catch a breather.
TTW00009996	I’d like to return your kindness. Here, take this key. It unlocks my safe. Lots of stuff in there I'll never use again. My adventuring days are over.
TTW00009997	I saw the Family's mark on the wall. What's up with that?
TTW00009998	Since my parents were already dead, they drank their blood and left the mark on the wall. He didn't want Evan to suspect that I had done it.
TTW00009999	When did you first discover you had the hunger?
TTW00010000	I was about 10 years old and I was playing with Lucy down under the overpass. We loved throwing rocks in the water.
TTW00010001	We saw some Wastelander trying to break open the Brahmin pens and steal one of them, so I ran over and told him to stop.
TTW00010002	He just laughed and pushed me away. When I fell, suddenly my head started to hurt and my eyes got all blurry. It was almost like I blacked out.
TTW00010003	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
TTW00010004	Then I can't help you. Sorry.
TTW00010005	I don't have 100 caps.
TTW00010006	Okay. And remember, if this doesn't help, try taking a bath in tomato juice.
TTW00010007	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
TTW00010008	Okay... all done.
TTW00010009	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
TTW00010010	Just stand still and try to ignore the tingling.
TTW00010011	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
TTW00010012	This might tickle a little. Or it might cause searing, agonizing pain to shoot through your body. You never know.
TTW00010013	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
TTW00010014	Here we go. You'll be rad-free in no time.
TTW00010015	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
TTW00010016	Can you heal my radiation?
TTW00010017	Sure can. Quick and easy, only 100 caps.
TTW00010018	Sure can. Quick and easy, only 100 caps.
TTW00010019	Let's trade.
TTW00010020	Okay. Here's what I have. What do you have?
TTW00010021	Okay.
TTW00010022	This is all I have. I hope it's okay.
TTW00010023	Excellent!
TTW00010024	I'm sure you'll find something agreeable.
TTW00010025	Alright. Let's see if we can't find something mutually agreeable.
TTW00010026	You're mostly a tree, right? Can't I just burn you down?
TTW00010027	Oh, no no no no no no no! Fire would be too painful for me and poor old Bob. You keep that stuff away from us!
TTW00010028	We're all okay. If you can call being stuck in a cave with 82 terrified kids okay. Alive, anyway. But I don't know what the hell we're going to do.
TTW00010029	It's been 4 days. Claudia went out this morning to look around, and never came back. Then Mr. Cob went out to look for her, and HE never came back.
TTW00010030	So now there's only me, two other teachers, two of the parents who were chaperoning, and a few of the cavern staff. And all these poor kids.
TTW00010031	We've got enough food and water to last for awhile, I guess. But after that? I just don't know. We can't stay in here forever. Can we?
TTW00010032	What happened down here?
TTW00010033	You shoulda seen my pop, he personally saved old Stanley! But guess you wouldn't know what it's like to have a hero for a dad, would you?
TTW00010034	Where can I rent a bed?
TTW00010035	Up at Moriarty's at the south end of town. Talk to Nova, she'll help you out.
TTW00010036	I'm the one who saved the kids from Paradise Falls.
TTW00010037	Oh yeah? Well why didn't you say so, you stupid mungo?
TTW00010038	Sorry, sounds like suicide. Be my guest.
TTW00010039	I dunno why you bothered to come here and wake me then. I would have been better off sleeping through it.
TTW00010040	They are?! Holy shit!
TTW00010041	Look, either I need to get out there and lend them a hand or they aren't going to last much longer.
TTW00010042	Tell me about the Brandice Family.
TTW00010043	You want help? Fork over some caps, Einstein.
TTW00010044	But I digress. If it's payment you need, all I can offer is one of my Mutagenic Bioenhancers.
TTW00010045	Books aren't going to buy me new ammunition.
TTW00010046	But I digress. If it's payment you need, all I can offer is one of my Mutagenic Bioenhancers.
TTW00010047	Is there anyone on this ship named Pinkerton?
TTW00010048	Pinkerton, eh? That name takes me way back. Claimed to have cured radiation poisoning. Or was it food poisoning? I don't recall.
TTW00010049	He was always telling folks that he founded Rivet City. All he did was break off the front of it. Or did he die there? I don't recall.
TTW00010050	You know of someone named Pinkerton?
TTW00010051	This is a hefty task, Doc. I'm going to need serious incentive.
TTW00010052	Yes, I suppose you're right. Science must learn to acquiesce to your standards in order to advance itself.
TTW00010053	I was merely going to offer one of my Mutagenic Bioenhancers, but I suppose I could up the ante.
TTW00010054	Sir, I encountered three Ferals on my patrol. This was somewhere around 0300 hours, I think, and it was dark, so they saw me first.
TTW00010055	I discharged my firearm four times, fatally striking two of the three. My weapon jammed before I could fire on the third target.
TTW00010056	He actually followed me back on his own. We put him in the trailer with the other and he's been quiet as you like. Strangest thing I've ever seen.
TTW00010057	I've managed to isolate some of the Fire Ant genes and distill them into human-safe genetic enhancers!
TTW00010058	I can inject you with one of these formulas and you'll find yourself with either enhanced strength or enhanced perception!
TTW00010059	Not only that, but you'll be somewhat more resistant to fire! How marvelous!
TTW00010060	This will stop the Fire Ants?
TTW00010061	No, it should all wrap up rather nicely. I've rigged my equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
TTW00010062	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
TTW00010063	So, that's all there is to it. What do you say?
TTW00010064	No, it should all wrap up rather nicely. I've rigged my equipment to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
TTW00010065	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
TTW00010066	However, there is one final detail I need your help with. Could you do something about Bryan Wilks for me?
TTW00010067	I hope that's everything, I've had enough of ants.
TTW00010068	Yes, it should all wrap up rather nicely. I've rigged my equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
TTW00010069	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
TTW00010070	So, that's all there is to it. What do you say?
TTW00010071	That's everything to do with the ants, yes indeed. I've rigged my equipment to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
TTW00010072	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
TTW00010073	However, there is one final detail I need your help with. Could you do something about Bryan Wilks for me?
TTW00010074	Just how will all this undo the mayhem you've caused?
TTW00010075	I've rigged the equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
TTW00010076	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
TTW00010077	So, that's all there is to it. What do you say?
TTW00010078	I've rigged the equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
TTW00010079	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
TTW00010080	However, there is one final detail I need your help with. Could you do something about Bryan Wilks for me?
TTW00010081	I'm ready for my Mutagenic Bioenhancer injection and Lab Coat, Doctor.
TTW00010082	How marvelous! Which injection did you want? Will it be the Ant Sight or Ant Might?
TTW00010083	I'm ready for my Mutagenic Bioenhancer injection, Doctor.
TTW00010084	I've killed all the Nest Guardians [Lie]
TTW00010085	Then I will proceed to my portable terminal at once and make the necessary changes to the formula.
TTW00010086	Let's proceed to my terminal and we'll see if I can undo all the damage I've caused.
TTW00010087	My work is done, Doctor.
TTW00010088	Oh, how marvelous! Please, tell me what happened.
TTW00010089	Oh, how marvelous! Please, tell me what happened.
TTW00010090	What kind of work do you do in here?
TTW00010091	Hmph. I'm the guy that got Rivet City up and running in the first place!
TTW00010092	Defender Morgan and I executed a reconnaissance mission last night to gauge Raider entrenchment in the structural underground of Fairfax.
TTW00010093	We located three entrances into underground utility tunnels, and confirmed the enemy has occupied and fortified these positions. Some are undefended.
TTW00010094	We also identified a small weapons cache in the southeast section of the tunnels. We were compromised by a patrol while placing explosives here.
TTW00010095	In accordance to mission parameters, we did not engage, instead retreating to Base. Raiders will be likely to attach more patrols to that area now.
TTW00010096	We've secured the building and are currently implementing our orders for the occupation of Fairfax.
TTW00010097	Raider activity in town has increased since we first took up positions in and around the fort. We've killed a lot of them and scared off others.
TTW00010098	But they just keep coming back. Their numbers seem limitless, while requests for our own reinforcements are repeatedly denied.
TTW00010099	That the Raiders take such continued risks to invade our facility appears to confirm suspicions that we've had an intelligence leak.
TTW00010100	They've tried tenaciously to infiltrate the base, but so far haven't stood a chance. Our objective remains the same: protect the research personnel.
TTW00010101	If you're talking about the Fire Ants, I'm already working on it.
TTW00010102	That's wonderful, kid. Now scram.
TTW00010103	Awww, come on. You're pretty tough taking out all those ants by yourself!
TTW00010104	The name's Bryan Wilks, by the way, I live in Grayditch. Well, that is, I did until those Fire Ants turned this place into a cemetery.
TTW00010105	Taylor, stop shooting, damnit!
TTW00010106	How the heck can an ant breathe fire?
TTW00010107	The stimulation of the subject's evolutionary trigger by the mutagen caused a bio-defensive reaction metamorphosing the ant's venom glands.
TTW00010108	This process caused unexpected oscillations in the venom molecules at such a vast rate it produces a thermodynamic biochemical reaction.
TTW00010109	As the subject ejects the volatile solution, it becomes conflagrant due to new structures in its maw I call its calefaction array.
TTW00010110	Amazing, isn't it?
TTW00010111	I changed my mind. I'll do it. I'll put in the code.
TTW00010112	Are you kidding me? We don't have time for this.
TTW00010113	Fine. If you're going to do it, then do it. But hurry up.
TTW00010114	What are you doing, following me?
TTW00010115	In a way. I tracked you using your Geomapper. Reilly sent me to find you so I could bring you this.
TTW00010116	No problem. What are you doing out here?
TTW00010117	Looking for you. I tracked you using your Geomapper. Reilly sent me to find you so I could bring you this.
TTW00010118	Nice. So that's the thanks I get for coming all this way to bring you this?
TTW00010119	Hey, you can't always count on me to save your ass.
TTW00010120	Donovan! What are you doing in these parts?
TTW00010121	Tracked you using the Geomapper. Reilly sent me to find you so I could bring you this.
TTW00010122	I've got to go now.
TTW00010123	You're obviously crazier than they are. Why would I listen to you?
TTW00010124	I can't say I blame you. Its my mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
TTW00010125	Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
TTW00010126	What do you say Herbert, should I give em' another chance?
TTW00010127	Oh ye- fine, fine... I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
TTW00010128	I'm not the killing type.
TTW00010129	No, I suppose you aren't. My mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
TTW00010130	Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
TTW00010131	What do you say Herbert, should I give em' another chance?
TTW00010132	Fine, fine... I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
TTW00010133	You've become an important part of their life. Without you, they're lost.
TTW00010134	So, they really need me that badly, huh? I guess I never thought of it that way. Awfully selfish of me.
TTW00010135	Should we give em' another chance, Herbert?
TTW00010136	Fine, fine... I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
TTW00010137	What, just give it to you? Hell no.
TTW00010138	I insist, my friend. It's the least I can do to help.
TTW00010139	No. Find your own water.
TTW00010140	Kill the humans! Kill them all! Aggghhh!
TTW00010141	Humans who?
TTW00010142	Humans.
TTW00010143	Who there?
TTW00010144	Why would an android feel guilt? Come on, Zimmer, what aren't you telling me?
TTW00010145	By God, you're as annoying as you are clever. Very well. I'll tell you what you want to know, if it helps you locate my property.
TTW00010146	The duty of this particular unit was the hunting and capturing of other escaped androids. Yes, others have escaped.
TTW00010147	It's one of the side effects of having such an advanced A.I. Machines start to think for themselves. Fool themselves into believing they have rights.
TTW00010148	What the hell just happened?
TTW00010149	There'll be more of them coming. We need to get out of here before they find us, or else your father died in vain.
TTW00010150	The android is dead. See, here's an internal component. <Lie.>
TTW00010151	Well. Here's 50 caps for your troubles. Try to buy yourself an education out here in this hell. Good day.
TTW00010152	Sorry Harkness, but this is the only way. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
TTW00010153	Agggggghh!!!
TTW00010154	Welcome back to reality, you filthy android. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
TTW00010155	Agggggghh!!!
TTW00010156	At ease.
TTW00010157	If I help you, is there some kind of reward?
TTW00010158	Of course! If you help me, and thus the android, God and the universe will smile upon you. Is there any better compensation?
TTW00010159	Anything else I should know?
TTW00010160	Just understand that this android is now, for all intents and purposes, a man. He looks human, he acts human. He believes he IS human.
TTW00010161	Can I join the Railroad?
TTW00010162	Tell you what. You deliver that component to Zimmer and tell him the android is dead, and you can consider yourself a member in good standing.
TTW00010163	What would you have me do?
TTW00010164	You really want to help? Take this. It's an internal component from the very android you're searching for. Don't ask how I obtained it.
TTW00010165	Present it to Doctor Zimmer in Rivet City. Tell him the android is dead, and that was on the corpse. He'll believe you.
TTW00010166	Do that, and Zimmer will go back to the Commonwealth, and leave that poor soul alone. Do that, and you'll have saved a man's life.
TTW00010167	Oh, dear. Is that old radio on the fritz again? I should turn it off.
TTW00010168	Yeah, run along and cry now!
TTW00010169	Shut up before I pound you!
TTW00010170	You know, the usual.
TTW00010171	Not much, I guess. Apart from keeping you dumbasses in line, that is.
TTW00010172	Just talking to morons who keep bugging me. Scram!
TTW00010173	Fun times and laughs as always!
TTW00010174	Cool junk and collecting, as always!
TTW00010175	I was running so fast, I thought my legs were gonna fly off, but then they didn't, which makes sense, 'cause legs don't have wings. You know?
TTW00010176	Just relaxing. Nothing much.
TTW00010177	Nothing.
TTW00010178	Just playing around, you know?
TTW00010179	Keeping everyone from killing themselves. Same as ever.
TTW00010180	Watching after the younger kids and seeing if they can't accidentally learn a thing or two. You know how it goes.
TTW00010181	Not much. Still trying to find a way to turn this fungus into something that doesn't taste like toenails.
TTW00010182	I got a new tooth today! It was just lying there and now it's mine!
TTW00010183	Not much.
TTW00010184	What's up, pal?
TTW00010185	What's happening, pal?
TTW00010186	Hewwo. What's up?
TTW00010187	Hello, there. What're you up to? Not getting into too much trouble?
TTW00010188	Hello. What's happening today?
TTW00010189	What're you up to, today?
TTW00010190	Hello. What's happening?
TTW00010191	Oh hey! What's happening? Something fun?
TTW00010192	Hello. Anything interesting happening?
TTW00010193	Hello. What's up?
TTW00010194	Hey, what's happening?
TTW00010195	Everything fine down here in paradise? What's happening?
TTW00010196	Hey, what's up?
TTW00010197	Tell me exactly who you are. Who you really are.
TTW00010198	And now I'm trapped here. It's all your fault.
TTW00010199	Can I buy some Ultrajet?
TTW00010200	Hmmm, so you wanna live life on the wild side, huh? Okay. Go for it.
TTW00010201	Yeah, as soon as you bring me some more Sugar Bombs.
TTW00010202	Have you ever heard of The Family?
TTW00010203	Sure. I stay away from them and they don't bother me. It's a good relationship. They live somewhere East of here.
TTW00010204	If you're feeling foolish, I think there's an underground way through to their place deeper into the metro station here.
TTW00010205	Here's all the Sugar Bombs I've got.
TTW00010206	Nice work. The Ultrajet's coming along nicely.
TTW00010207	Excellent! keep it coming.
TTW00010208	Make it 30 caps each and you got yourself a deal.
TTW00010209	Fine, anything to get what I need. Now scram, I got some preparing to do!
TTW00010210	Not now. I'm busy.
TTW00010211	I changed my mind. I'll go with you to Rivet City.
TTW00010212	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you'll consider meeting me in Rivet City.
TTW00010213	I changed my mind. I'm not going to go with you right now.
TTW00010214	That's good to hear. Let's not waste any time.
TTW00010215	May I have the key to the Research Safe?
TTW00010216	Certainly, allow me to whip up a copy for you.
TTW00010217	There you are. Have a wonderful and productive day!
TTW00010218	I killed Junders Plunkett.
TTW00010219	Well, it's about time someone put that bastard out of his misery.
TTW00010220	And here's the reward for it. Spend it well, Lawbringer.
TTW00010221	Where did you come from?
TTW00010222	I'm sort of stuck here. Colin says that I can't leave until I pay off my debt to him. Of course, he charges me room and board too.
TTW00010223	If you ever get to Underworld, tell Carol that I said hi.
TTW00010224	You touched Antler!
TTW00010225	Now you pay!
TTW00010226	Antler is my friend!
TTW00010227	Antler loves me! Not you!
TTW00010228	No one touch Antler but ME!
TTW00010229	Your eyes on Antler! Stop looking!
TTW00010230	Well, saints alive. That is a load off. Nothing to be done, though. Those ghouls just didn't know when they weren't wanted. Couldn't take a hint.
TTW00010231	And aren't you just the most unexpected gift our little town ever had? Here, take this. And go buy yourself something nice.
TTW00010232	I killed the ghouls at REPCONN.
TTW00010233	Good idea.
TTW00010234	I guess I'll be going.
TTW00010235	Big room. Metal staircase. East side of the building. Is that too many syllables for you?
TTW00010236	Tell me again how to find you.
TTW00010237	Like I said, find the metal staircase in the big room on the east side of the building. It's where they used to make rockets.
TTW00010238	Where are you located?
TTW00010239	Who I am doesn't matter, smoothskin. Stop wasting time and get up here.
TTW00010240	Who are you?
TTW00010241	Any idea what the NCR's up to in Primm?
TTW00010242	Your guess's as good as mine. Probably better.
TTW00010243	Have you heard if the NCR has any plans to attack the prison north of here?
TTW00010244	...then you bring your second unit up to provide covering fire, like so...
TTW00010245	You mess with a man's radio, and he might take it personal like, you hear?
TTW00010246	Hey Jason, your rockets are ready!
TTW00010247	That armor isn't working. Leave it there.
TTW00010248	Good luck killing something with that. Thing's busted.
TTW00010249	You got it.
TTW00010250	I'd like to purchase something.
TTW00010251	If by some chance you want to find me again, and if by some even greater chance coyotes haven't picked my bones clean, I'll be at my shack.
TTW00010252	You'll do fine. Farewell, mi amigo.
TTW00010253	Anything's better than staying here. Let's go.
TTW00010254	Actually, do you want to tag along with me?
TTW00010255	Sure, boss. I'd be happy to prolong my captivity and psychological abuse to tighten some lug nuts for you.
TTW00010256	Can you repair some of my stuff?
TTW00010257	You got the caps, I got the skills.
TTW00010258	Can you repair some of my stuff?
TTW00010259	Sure, I'll just pull a toolbox out from behind a conveniently-placed rock and get to work.
TTW00010260	Can you repair some of my stuff?
TTW00010261	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010262	Sure, no problem.
TTW00010263	Take a look.
TTW00010264	Let me see what you have for sale.
TTW00010265	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
TTW00010266	Have a look.
TTW00010267	You bet.
TTW00010268	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
TTW00010269	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010270	Of course.
TTW00010271	It pleases me to see you, mistress. I owe my functional state to this human here.
TTW00010272	R- Rhonda? Is that you?
TTW00010273	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010274	I am ready to process our transaction.
TTW00010275	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010276	Glad to do it.
TTW00010277	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010278	Sure thing!
TTW00010279	Got anything for sale?
TTW00010280	Take your pick.
TTW00010281	You need to clean up your reputation or you're going to get me in trouble - I'll have to charge you more to keep from arousing suspicion.
TTW00010282	I'd like to buy some supplies.
TTW00010283	The brass are pissed about the trouble you've been causing. Your caps are no good here.
TTW00010284	Maybe you didn't hear me the first time. No service for scumbags!
TTW00010285	Hey, I heard you were able to recover Morales' corpse. In thanks, you get a discount on supplies.
TTW00010286	That was a real honorable thing you done there, kid. Much appreciated.
TTW00010287	Here's what's currently available.
TTW00010288	I'd like to buy some food.
TTW00010289	Chow down.
TTW00010290	Sorry, but the brass ordered me to not serve enemies of NCR.
TTW00010291	I don't like your kind taking food from my men, so I'm going to charge you a little extra. Don't like it? Tough.
TTW00010292	Roger Lupa.
TTW00010293	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010294	All right, then. Hopefully I've got something to wet your whistle.
TTW00010295	Come talk to me when I'm in my store and I'll be glad to do business with you.
TTW00010296	That was some fine doctoring. I could learn a thing or two from you!
TTW00010297	Motor-Runner told me he was going to pick up some more when the Khans come back through.
TTW00010298	Yeah, me too. Gonna have to go hit the boss for a fix soon.
TTW00010299	Shit. I gotta go find something to take the edge off.
TTW00010300	Me too. I think I need a fix.
TTW00010301	I got it from my buddy. I think he made it himself.
TTW00010302	Where'd you get it from?
TTW00010303	Fuck! I did too. I'm not doing well.
TTW00010304	I didn't say anything.
TTW00010305	Well keep moving.
TTW00010306	I'm looking at you.
TTW00010307	Damn, I gotta find some shit.
TTW00010308	You and me both.
TTW00010309	Fuck, I need a fix.
TTW00010310	Nope, not for you at least.
TTW00010311	That's it.
TTW00010312	Yeah, you do that.
TTW00010313	Must have been some NCR. I know they've been gunning for him.
TTW00010314	Damn, are you serious? He was one tough son of a bitch.
TTW00010315	Good, I hated that fucker.
TTW00010316	Move it! Move it! Move it! Get those legs up you sorry bastards!
TTW00010317	Your plan worked. The plane floated up. Seemed to be intact.
TTW00010318	That's tremendous! I'll transmit instructions to the robots to start packing up the plane to bring it back to Nellis!
TTW00010319	And you're even more handsome up close. Do you think it'll be okay if I hang around here for a little while, so we can get to know each other better?
TTW00010320	Hi there, it's great to meet you as well.
TTW00010321	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010322	Can do.
TTW00010323	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010324	I'm sure I've got something you'll like.
TTW00010325	Got a special discount for you, after what you done for us.
TTW00010326	Now I know what they mean by "dumb luck"!
TTW00010327	Were you exaggerating your knowledge of medicine? Even I would've known not to do that!
TTW00010328	Well, if you're heading back out there, you ought to have this.
TTW00010329	They call it a Pip-Boy. I grew up in one of them vaults they made before the war. We all got one.
TTW00010330	Ain't much use to me now, but you might want such a thing, after what you been through. I know what it's like, having something taken from you.
TTW00010331	And put this on, too, so the locals don't pick on you for lacking modesty. Was my wife's.
TTW00010332	I think she was about your size, and she hardly wore it after we left the vault. Felt it was too brazen.
TTW00010333	And put this on, too, so the locals don't pick on you for lacking modesty. Never was much my style anyway.
TTW00010334	You should talk to Sunny Smiles before you leave town. She can help you learn to fend for yourself in the desert. She'll likely be at the saloon.
TTW00010335	I reckon some of the other folks at the saloon might be able to help you out, too. And the metal fella, Victor, who pulled you outta your grave.
TTW00010336	Anyway, you ever get hurt out there, you come right back. I'll fix you up.
TTW00010337	But try not to get killed anymore.
TTW00010338	I'd like to trade.
TTW00010339	Oh, that's right! Here, let me show you what I've got on hand.
TTW00010340	Now, I don't know about you, but old Festus here never met a bandit that felt anything akin to remorse.
TTW00010341	The sheriff suggested that maybe the bandits, in a fit of remorse, delivered the items. After taking all of the stranger's money, of course.
TTW00010342	You can really get hurt out there.
TTW00010343	Well, I already told you I came from a vault. After that, was a traveling doctor for a spell.
TTW00010344	Seemed like a good idea at the time. Most folks out here ain't educated, so people with medical know-how are hard to come by.
TTW00010345	Found that I could help a lot of people with what I knew, and that was all right with me.
TTW00010346	Eventually, I went back and married my childhood sweetheart and that was the end of my traveling days. Didn't miss it none then. Still don't.
TTW00010347	Tell me about yourself, Doc.
TTW00010348	Sure, I'll come with you.
TTW00010349	Shouldn't take more than a couple minutes. Especially with two of us.
TTW00010350	Come with me.
TTW00010351	Now, see those sarsaparilla bottles on that fence there? Take this and try to hit a couple of 'em.
TTW00010352	That was some fine doctoring. I could learn a thing or two from you!
TTW00010353	I ran out of ammo.
TTW00010354	Yep, I'd say you're getting a little trigger happy there. Try to slow down a bit. Concentrate on hitting your target.
TTW00010355	Here. Go easy on it, now. Ammo can be hard to come by out here.
TTW00010356	I'd like to see what you have on tap.
TTW00010357	Caps up front. We don't do tabs here.
TTW00010358	What guns do you have for sale?
TTW00010359	Have a look.
TTW00010360	What do you have in stock?
TTW00010361	Take a gander.
TTW00010362	Do you have anything for sale?
TTW00010363	Sure. Take a look.
TTW00010364	Not for someone like you. My customers would shit a brick if they knew I sold anything to you.
TTW00010365	If you need help cleaning up your rep around Freeside, I might be able to help... for a price.
TTW00010366	Thank you, Victor.
TTW00010367	Come back soon, now!
TTW00010368	I see you brought a friend! Sorry, pardner, but they're gonna have to stay outside.
TTW00010369	I see you brought some friends! Sorry, pardner, but they're gonna have to stay outside.
TTW00010370	I have Vault gear for you.
TTW00010371	You do? That's wonderful! Let me see what you brought.
TTW00010372	All right! That's going to net you lots of caps, my friend. Do you want to trade all your vault suits right now?
TTW00010373	Let's see what you have for sale.
TTW00010374	Take a look at this.
TTW00010375	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
TTW00010376	Of course.
TTW00010377	Could you repair some things for me?
TTW00010378	Sure, let's see what you've got.
TTW00010379	Hey, here is that gun I promised you. I suggest using it while they are talking, I'm pretty sure they're going to kill you after they've talked.
TTW00010380	Hey, I'll take care of them when you're ready, just say the word. I suggest doing it while they're talking to get the drop on them.
TTW00010381	Yeah, I would like that.
TTW00010382	Oh, that makes me so happy! You are too much!
TTW00010383	I've bugged the tower for you.
TTW00010384	We haven't received any information yet from the bug. Please report back when you've found a way into House's network.
TTW00010385	I've bugged the tower for you. <lie>
TTW00010386	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
TTW00010387	<aroo?> <bark>
TTW00010388	I think I may have misheard that order.
TTW00010389	Very well.
TTW00010390	At ease.
TTW00010391	Bo-ring.
TTW00010392	Oh, do I have to? That's not nearly as much fun!
TTW00010393	Your call, kid.
TTW00010394	If you insist...
TTW00010395	<whine>
TTW00010396	Standing by for further orders.
TTW00010397	That seems incredibly juvenile.
TTW00010398	I've had no compelling reason to do anything different from what you asked.
TTW00010399	What the hell, man?
TTW00010400	You big tease!
TTW00010401	Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
TTW00010402	Get lost.
TTW00010403	Yes, dearie, that's what grandma's been doing. And Leo isn't happy about it, either.
TTW00010404	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
TTW00010405	<aroo?>
TTW00010406	<growl> <bark>
TTW00010407	By your command, sir!
TTW00010408	Now that's more like it!
TTW00010409	I must have been hearing things.
TTW00010410	Now's the time for blood!
TTW00010411	I shall remain vigilant.
TTW00010412	They shall know the power of my steel!
TTW00010413	Yeah yeah, very funny.
TTW00010414	Rock and roll!
TTW00010415	Stuff it.
TTW00010416	Oh, time for fun already? Goody!
TTW00010417	Fuck you!
TTW00010418	Goddammit, I love violence!
TTW00010419	Already done.
TTW00010420	As you wish.
TTW00010421	I suppose I should test you out before I hand you to the Garrets...
TTW00010422	Servos active!
TTW00010423	I spoke to Clanden, and I couldn't get anything out of him.
TTW00010424	Yeah, this is Clanden. This guy is one sick motherfucker. The way I see it, you have a few options.
TTW00010425	Maybe you could use what's on these tapes to get him by himself, or maybe you could use them to leverage him out of the casino.
TTW00010426	I found these tapes in Clanden's room, can you verify this is him?
TTW00010427	I hear you have some exotic tastes when it comes to women.
TTW00010428	Oh did you now? What business is that of yours, and why the fuck should I care?
TTW00010429	What are you selling?
TTW00010430	Have a look, baby.
TTW00010431	Let me see what you have.
TTW00010432	Here you go.
TTW00010433	Can I buy bottled water?
TTW00010434	Sure thing.
TTW00010435	Do you sell medical supplies?
TTW00010436	We're pretty short-handed as it is, but I suppose I could spare a few items.
TTW00010437	I'd like to buy medical supplies.
TTW00010438	We don't have a lot right now, but this is what I can offer for sale.
TTW00010439	Here is what we have available.
TTW00010440	Good. Look around and get a feel for where customers and risks can enter and exit the area while I get your gear ready.
TTW00010441	<Hushed> Would my companion here make a suitable replacement meal?
TTW00010442	I'm sorry, but it absolutely must be a human. Former doesn't count.
TTW00010443	Very well. If you're able to convince young Mr. Gunderson to return to his father, replace him in the freezer with your friend and we'll have a deal.
TTW00010444	Tell me what I need to do.
TTW00010445	I need a replacement, and I need the boy taken care of. The replacement must be healthy and well-bred. One can't very well make steak from gristle.
TTW00010446	With so little time, we'll have to go after our original choice, Carlyle St. Clair. He lives in a shack north of here. For freshness, we need him alive.
TTW00010447	If you could send him here or knock him out with this and drag him into the dumpster next to his house, we can do the rest.
TTW00010448	Let me see what you have for sale.
TTW00010449	Take your pick.
TTW00010450	Of course! I've got a special discount for special people, like you.
TTW00010451	A friend of The Strip's a friend of mine.
TTW00010452	Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your business, but dealing with you carries extra costs.
TTW00010453	I'll sell to you, if only to get you out of sight as soon as possible.
TTW00010454	Wow. Bringing up morale must be difficult.
TTW00010455	I'd like to browse your special inventory.
TTW00010456	Like I always say, a polite society is an armed society.
TTW00010457	I'd like to trade.
TTW00010458	I don't have any supplies to spare, but I've got caps if you have anything you don't need.
TTW00010459	I don't have any supplies to spare for someone with your spotted reputation, but buy your stuff for half the going rate.
TTW00010460	Sure. Serve me up something.
TTW00010461	You won't regret it. At least until an hour or so from now.
TTW00010462	No thanks.
TTW00010463	Suit yourself. Gambling's thirsty work - I'll be here if you change your mind.
TTW00010464	You bet, I'm parched.
TTW00010465	Best booze in Vegas, baby. What'll it be?
TTW00010466	I left one of my companions in the freezer for your enjoyment.
TTW00010467	Wonderful. You have come through with flying colors. On behalf of my colleagues, allow me to extend my thanks.
TTW00010468	I know what a terrible sacrifice this must've been for you.
TTW00010469	Not my problem. You want to go? You're on your own.
TTW00010470	You're the one who suggested it.
TTW00010471	Fine. If I'm on my own I'm on my own. But I'm gonna go.
TTW00010472	Good working with you.
TTW00010473	Let's get out of here. Let them have Bitter Springs.
TTW00010474	You can do what you want, but I'm not going anywhere.
TTW00010475	Let's do this.
TTW00010476	Good luck - you'll need it.
TTW00010477	I'm ready.
TTW00010478	Watch out for her - she's one of the deadliest fighters I've ever seen.
TTW00010479	I'm ready.
TTW00010480	Careful in there - he's tougher than he looks.
TTW00010481	Got it. I'm ready.
TTW00010482	Good luck.
TTW00010483	That's not how I want to approach this. You'd better go your own way for now.
TTW00010484	Better be a good reason. I didn't join up with you to go on nature walks.
TTW00010485	I don't want any trouble. We should part ways for now.
TTW00010486	Fine. But if you make any new friends in there, all bets are off.
TTW00010487	I'm going to do this my way. I can't bring you.
TTW00010488	You say so.
TTW00010489	[Attack] You're less trouble to me dead than alive.
TTW00010490	Good thing I'm still alive, then.
TTW00010491	Then we can't work together anymore.
TTW00010492	I should never have worked with you in the first place.
TTW00010493	Sorry. I won't compromise my mission.
TTW00010494	Then we're finished here.
TTW00010495	[Attack] I won't be needing your services any longer.
TTW00010496	I should never have trusted you.
TTW00010497	Things have changed. I'm with Caesar now.
TTW00010498	Then this is over. Next time I see you, it'll be through my scope.
TTW00010499	Any Legion with you and I'm pulling the trigger.
TTW00010500	I'm... uh... helping them so I can spy on them better.
TTW00010501	Bullshit. You're a goddamned coward, trying to pick the winning side.
TTW00010502	We will never work together again.
TTW00010503	I'm ready to fight Lupa now.
TTW00010504	All right. You've been a good dog, Lupa. Die well, girl.
TTW00010505	Transplant Lupa's brain into Rex.
TTW00010506	Have a seat. This will take a while.
TTW00010507	Transplant Rey's brain into Rex.
TTW00010508	Have a seat. This will take a while.
TTW00010509	Transplant Violetta's brain into Rex.
TTW00010510	Have a seat. This will take a while.
TTW00010511	I'm looking into the Nightstalker mutation. Want to come along with me?
TTW00010512	Oooh, those Nightstalkers, always killing my Bighorners! It'll be nice to give them a piece of my mind!
TTW00010513	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010514	Sure thing.
TTW00010515	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010516	Happy to do it.
TTW00010517	What do you have for sale?
TTW00010518	Oh, you're buying? Cool.
TTW00010519	Oh, you're buying? Tell you what, since you've been acting all, well, random lately, how about a discount? Might calm you down.
TTW00010520	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010521	All right.
TTW00010522	I need repairs.
TTW00010523	Did you still want to help Doctor Henry run his experiment?
TTW00010524	Actually, I'm more comfortable now that I know you've had some training.
TTW00010525	Well, thanks for taking a chance on a naive young girl from California with stars in her eyes and a pneumatic gauntlet on her hand.
TTW00010526	Let's hit the road, huh?
TTW00010527	You gonna do it or not?
TTW00010528	Come on, ya bitch! You swing like a girl!
TTW00010529	You know what? I don't need this bullshit right now. We'll take off that goddamn power armor, if it'll just shut you up.
TTW00010530	Who is Ezekiel?
TTW00010531	He's a member of the Followers like myself, but his particular field is Pre-War history and tribal culture.
TTW00010532	I do recall him being fascinated by the Khans, he kept going on about parallels to some ancient historical empire or another.
TTW00010533	I have things I need to do. You'd better go alone.
TTW00010534	Not much for family gatherings, huh? All right, have it your way.
TTW00010535	You ever want to look me up again, I'll be in my bunker in Hidden Valley. That's the luxury bunker.
TTW00010536	Transplant Violetta's brain into Rex.
TTW00010537	Have a seat. This will take a while.
TTW00010538	Transplant Lupa's brain into Rex.
TTW00010539	All right, then. Be patient since this will take a while.
TTW00010540	Transplant Rey's brain into Rex.
TTW00010541	All right, then. Be patient since this will take a while.
TTW00010542	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010543	All right.
TTW00010544	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010545	What can I get you?
TTW00010546	It sounded like you were writing poetry.
TTW00010547	Oh. You heard that, huh? Okay, so yeah, I was writing poetry. I know, I know, it's not a very Great Khan-like thing to do.
TTW00010548	The Followers of the Apocalypse came to our camp when I was a kid, and they brought a bunch of old books. I used to read Pre-War poetry for hours.
TTW00010549	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010550	Because you're a friend of the Followers, I can give you a bit of a discount.
TTW00010551	Very well.
TTW00010552	Here's the caps.
TTW00010553	All right, this will only take a few minutes.
TTW00010554	Got some songs coming up for you right now. At least one is probably about love.
TTW00010555	These headlines were brought to you by Vault 21. Vault 21. Everything's better when you experience it in a vault.
TTW00010556	NewsStory
TTW00010557	Diners at the Gourmand are giving the restaurant rave reviews for executive chef Philippe's brand new menu offerings.
TTW00010558	NewsIntro
TTW00010559	I've got news for you.
TTW00010560	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010561	Can do.
TTW00010562	Sir, yes, Sir!
TTW00010563	Sir, yes, Sir!
TTW00010564	Let's see what you have.
TTW00010565	The right weapons for my kind of customer.
TTW00010566	The others here don't understand our kind, but you can count on me, friend.
TTW00010567	You aren't exactly good for business, so you'll have to live with my prices.
TTW00010568	Have a discount, friend. I can't wait to see what you do with these, next.
TTW00010569	It's an honor to have my wares used by such a wild badass. Cut's on the house, friend.
TTW00010570	Take a look at these beauties.
TTW00010571	Hmmm... think I could slip bigger weapons past the guards?
TTW00010572	You know, sometimes the journey beats the destination. Especially if your spurs go Jingle Jangle Jingle, and you meet some nice gals on the way.
TTW00010573	WoooooOOOOOOoooooo
TTW00010574	Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
TTW00010575	Where else?
TTW00010576	Nah, I'm gonna chill with my girl.
TTW00010577	Can't. The King's got me busy on something.
TTW00010578	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010579	Have a look.
TTW00010580	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010581	You got it.
TTW00010582	I, Robert Edwin House, am deceased. Please approach a Securitron and take one of the printed obituaries.
TTW00010583	I'd like you to go back to the Lucky 38 for now.
TTW00010584	<whine> <bark>
TTW00010585	Yes sir!
TTW00010586	Very well.
TTW00010587	Very well.
TTW00010588	Tunnel Snakes rule!
TTW00010589	Whatever you say, honey.
TTW00010590	Whatever kid, whatever.
TTW00010591	As you wish.
TTW00010592	<Makes beeping sounds>
TTW00010593	<Companion Protocol::Return Base>
TTW00010594	Nice! Can I order room service?
TTW00010595	I do. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
TTW00010596	Hey, as long as you're not asking me to go back to Black Mountain, I'm a happy old man.
TTW00010597	It is. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
TTW00010598	<bark!>
TTW00010599	All right. Guess Vegas it is.
TTW00010600	Back to the gilded cage.
TTW00010601	I'll make my way there.
TTW00010602	I do. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
TTW00010603	Back to the tomb, I suppose. If you need me, et cetera.
TTW00010604	No problem, I'll head up by myself.
TTW00010605	Come back soon, now!
TTW00010606	Yeah, let's play again.
TTW00010607	Let the Caravan Lesson begin.
TTW00010608	I'm all done playing for now.
TTW00010609	What? Afraid to lose. Well come find me if you want to play again.
TTW00010610	Nice try. Let's play another game.
TTW00010611	Wow, you're good. Give me another game.
TTW00010612	Want to play a hand of Caravan?
TTW00010613	I'm going to roll over you.
TTW00010614	Let me see what you have for sale.
TTW00010615	You won't find better.
TTW00010616	Remember, an impressive gratuity sends a message.
TTW00010617	Our drinks have many subtle flavors.
TTW00010618	Sure let me take a look at those magazines.
TTW00010619	Take a look.
TTW00010620	I'll pay you for the key.
TTW00010621	We can come to a deal. My price is firm, though - Saint James is a good customer and it better be worth it if I'm going to lose him.
TTW00010622	Yes, please.
TTW00010623	Take a look.
TTW00010624	How do you spell "gesticulate?"
TTW00010625	Vacate the premises immediately. All Securitrons are at a state of high alert.
TTW00010626	Damn it, will you die already?
TTW00010627	The Lucky 38 will be your grave. I'll finish what Benny couldn't get right!
TTW00010628	 One last thing. Is there any truth to the rumor that all Nightkin are slightly crazy from their overuse of psychologically damaging Pre-War tech?
TTW00010629	Let's get on with it, shall we? Hmm?
TTW00010630	Greetings, General Oliver. The disappointment you are about to experience delights me.
TTW00010631	Point guns at us, and we will destroy you.
TTW00010632	Please do not struggle, General Oliver, you might hurt yourself. You can relax presently.
TTW00010633	Did something... happen between you two?
TTW00010634	Ugh. So gross. It was bad enough that I didn't get any data out of the Securitron. This is why I didn't want to talk about it.
TTW00010635	It only happened once. I chalk it up to sleep deprivation and one atomic cocktail too many.
TTW00010636	As long as you leave right after you put your caps down, you're on.
TTW00010637	Got enough on my shoulders without adding more dead weight to 'em.
TTW00010638	Show me one, and I'll do him proud.
TTW00010639	| Wild Wasteland |Ain't nothing but a hound dog.
TTW00010640	No, and ain't looking to be a babysitter, neither.
TTW00010641	Wanted to be with someone who knew how to please a woman, that's what.
TTW00010642	Stake a claim somewhere else, pretty boy.
TTW00010643	Let's trade.
TTW00010644	Come and get me.
TTW00010645	Let's see what you've got.
TTW00010646	We don't have to fight. We can still talk about this.
TTW00010647	No, I'm done talking.
TTW00010648	I'm sorry I had to kill him - he didn't give me much choice.
TTW00010649	Well, anyway, Judah's given Orion's armor to you now. It'll take a few hours for me to show you how to use it properly, so let's get started.
TTW00010650	What will your friends think about this?
TTW00010651	I've known them far longer than you have. They'll get over it.
TTW00010652	Tell me about New Vegas.
TTW00010653	It's big, it's bright, and it's one of the biggest cities still left from before the War. Well, mostly, anyway.
TTW00010654	Used to be just a curiosity. The buildings were Pre-War, but it was just as full of raiders and barbarian tribes as anyplace else.
TTW00010655	Then Mr. House took over, got the power turned back on, and got the tribes reformed into something civilized. Now they run his casinos for him.
TTW00010656	VEndingFiends
TTW00010657	Never weakened by NCR, the Fiends staged an attack against Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
TTW00010658	Though NCR repulsed the Fiends, they suffered heavy losses in the process.
TTW00010659	The Fiends overran Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
TTW00010660	In the anarchic months that followed, the Fiends asserted dominance over Outer Vegas.
TTW00010661	The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam and, despite suffering heavy losses, overran it.
TTW00010662	They continued to be a nuisance throughout Outer Vegas, but never established full control over the area.
TTW00010663	<Coughing Fit>
TTW00010664	I knew I should've been an actress.
TTW00010665	Ouch.
TTW00010666	Physician, heal thyself. Guess it's a good thing they invented stims.
TTW00010667	I need healing powder!
TTW00010668	Grandma needs to have a little lie down!
TTW00010669	Wake
TTW00010670	Oof.
TTW00010671	Hmm?
TTW00010672	Okay, okay, I'm up. What's next?
TTW00010673	What'd I miss?
TTW00010674	What am I wearing? Cardboard?
TTW00010675	I don't have much protection here. Mind helping me out?
TTW00010676	This armor's gonna get me killed.
TTW00010677	Look, I'm dead unless you can get me some real armor.
TTW00010678	Got anything bigger I can fight with?
TTW00010679	Might be time for a weapon upgrade.
TTW00010680	Might as well be throwing rocks.
TTW00010681	You got a bigger gun I can borrow?
TTW00010682	Need a new weapon.
TTW00010683	This weapon's done for.
TTW00010684	This weapon's done.
TTW00010685	Spare some ammo?
TTW00010686	My guns are empty!
TTW00010687	That's better. Maybe I should've been a surgeon.
TTW00010688	Patched up. Let's get back to the fight.
TTW00010689	Will the medical wonders of the post-apocalyptic world never cease?
TTW00010690	Didn't even leave a scar.
TTW00010691	Crippled
TTW00010692	I could use a Doctor's Bag if you have any handy.
TTW00010693	Can't feel all my limbs.
TTW00010694	Regenerating
TTW00010695	That helps.
TTW00010696	MMmmahh. <Smacks lips>
TTW00010697	Sweet as roses.
TTW00010698	Need to lighten my load.
TTW00010699	I'm not exactly in Power Armor over here, so why don't you help lighten my load a bit?
TTW00010700	I'm not standing here because I'm overburdened with emotion. Take some of this stuff off me so I can move a little more easily.
TTW00010701	Hey, don't worry about it, boss. The decrepit old man can easily carry all your stuff for you. Really.
TTW00010702	I'd like to purchase some supplies.
TTW00010703	Sure thing.
TTW00010704	Unfortunately for you, I'm not authorized to trade with you. It's against regulations.
TTW00010705	<Gasps> For me? Do you mean it? No, it's too much! Well, okay. But it's too much! It's perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
TTW00010706	Aw, you shouldn't have! It's just my taste. Thank you.
TTW00010707	Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Look what they're wearing! I've only seen dresses like those in my dreams. And even then I couldn't afford them.
TTW00010708	Walking the Mojave with you can't be any worse than here, that's for sure. All right, I'm in.
TTW00010709	Looking to join up with me again?
TTW00010710	Was reminded why I left this place soon as I walked in. Let's go.
TTW00010711	All right. Come on, let's go.
TTW00010712	Thank god, the sooner the better.
TTW00010713	I changed my mind. This is something we should confront together.
TTW00010714	No. This is something for me to deal with. But I'm glad you're here.
TTW00010715	<Attack> That's it. Tired of listening to you anyway.
TTW00010716	You're seriously going to draw on me? Fine, do it, see what happens.
TTW00010717	Good, go back to your famil... oh wait, they're fucking dead.
TTW00010718	You son of a bitch. You know, I was just going to give you a piece of my mind and now? Now I'm going to put you down.
TTW00010719	Go back West, then, see if I care.
TTW00010720	You can have your shit back, I don't need it or want it. You go your way, I'm going mine.
TTW00010721	Staying low.
TTW00010722	O... kay. I'll do my best.
TTW00010723	Keeping quiet... unless my creaking knees give us away.
TTW00010724	Oh, don't you worry about me, dearie, your grandma knows how to stay quiet.
TTW00010725	Can you spare any medical supplies?
TTW00010726	Just let me know what you need.
TTW00010727	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00010728	Our patrols are always bringing more stuff in. Take a look.
TTW00010729	Wait, you can make Moonshine?
TTW00010730	Yeah, what else you going to do with an empty bottle? Wait for it to refill itself?
TTW00010731	Get me some ingredients out of the Mojave, an empty bottle, a little time, and I'll keep us stocked.
TTW00010732	I'd like to buy some food.
TTW00010733	Here is what we have available.
TTW00010734	Could I buy some spare munitions?
TTW00010735	Sure. Pearl gave the green light. Take a look at the manifest.
TTW00010736	Not without Pearl's permission, and she hasn't given permission.
TTW00010737	I bet I'm going to like it in that mainframe!
TTW00010738	Attention. ARCHIMEDES I Laser is now armed. Move all personnel to minimum safe distance before initiating test fire.
TTW00010739	ARCHIMEDES II orbital laser bombardment will commence in T-minus 5... 4... 3... 2... 1.
TTW00010740	Fair enough.
TTW00010741	All right. Let's not waste any time. There are people out there to help, things to learn. Maybe not in that order, but let's get to it.
TTW00010742	I'd like you to come with me.
TTW00010743	A courier, doctor, and a cybernetic dog. After we deal with the whole "imminent conquest of New Vegas" problem we should open an act at the Tops.
TTW00010744	Well, there are worse things happening in the world, right?
TTW00010745	After spending thirty years of my life hiding my association with the Enclave, I'd love to stroll the wasteland with a twitchy Eyebot.
TTW00010746	Thanks for asking. I appreciate it. I do.
TTW00010747	Back in your good graces again? I knew you'd see the light.
TTW00010748	I need you to leave.
TTW00010749	I thought my charm could win you over, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. Are you sure you want me to go?
TTW00010750	All right, I'll head back to the Old Mormon Fort. If you need me, just swing by.
TTW00010751	Ugh. I guess that means I have to go back to that creepy mausoleum Mr. House calls the Lucky 38.
TTW00010752	I've been around a few unsettling places in my life, but that place takes the cake.
TTW00010753	Anyway, if you need me, you know where to find me.
TTW00010754	Back to the tomb, I suppose.
TTW00010755	Fine. Get lost.
TTW00010756	That was the plan. Bye.
TTW00010757	Why?
TTW00010758	Because you're helping Caesar's Legion. They are bad. You are bad. I am going. Bye.
TTW00010759	Why are you crazy? That's a question for someone much wiser and more patient than me.
TTW00010760	All I know is that you are a bad person and I don't want to be around you anymore. So if that was your goal, congratulations.
TTW00010761	If not, I'm sorry to inform you that you are, as the locals say, "nuttier than a Bighorner dropping."
TTW00010762	If you have a problem with me, why don't you just leave right now?
TTW00010763	If you insist. Have a nice life.
TTW00010764	They hide behind NCR's protection and they deserve everything coming to them.
TTW00010765	They sure don't, but I hope you get everything that's coming to you.
TTW00010766	Have a nice life.
TTW00010767	That's a good way to put it.
TTW00010768	Sure, if you're a sociopath.
TTW00010769	Enjoy the fruits of your labor.
TTW00010770	More than collateral damage. A necessary sacrifice.
TTW00010771	How noble of you.
TTW00010772	Sorry, but I won't be sticking around to see if you have the courtesy to lay flowers on the mass grave that the Legion's going to dig for them.
TTW00010773	Actually, yes, I would like to see New Vegas turned into a slavery hub.
TTW00010774	Great! You're either unimaginably cruel or profoundly insane!
TTW00010775	Either way, I'm not going to wait around for you to help the Legion roll across Hoover Dam. Bye.
TTW00010776	The Legion is better than the alternative.
TTW00010777	What?! Caesar is going to enslave or kill everyone in the Mojave.
TTW00010778	And when that's done, he'll try to destroy the NCR senate and install himself as its new military dictator.
TTW00010779	I can't comprehend how Caesar could so extensively scramble your sense of morality to make you think the Legion is a better alternative to anything.
TTW00010780	And you know what? I'm not going to stick around to try and figure it out. At least legionaries have the excuse of being born into it.
TTW00010781	Have a nice life.
TTW00010782	Quite well. Thank you for asking, Veronica.
TTW00010783	Veronica.
TTW00010784	I'm surprised you're not wearing that hood to hide your hair like you usually do, Veronica.
TTW00010785	Yeah, sounds cool.
TTW00010786	Nah, I'm gonna be busy.
TTW00010787	Maybe, depends on how my girl's feeling.
TTW00010788	Nothing, man.
TTW00010789	Just hanging out. Same as usual.
TTW00010790	I was thinking of taking a walk a little later.
TTW00010791	I might be going scum-hunting later. You game?
TTW00010792	Nothing. Want to head to the Wrangler later?
TTW00010793	I'd like to see your wares.
TTW00010794	Sure. Here's what I've got.
TTW00010795	I could use some help with my gear.
TTW00010796	Let me sign off on the work order for you, then.
TTW00010797	What do you have for trade?
TTW00010798	Take a look.
TTW00010799	For you? I'm not sure I want to be seen dealing with you... but if you're willing to pay a little extra...
TTW00010800	He's standing right outside your tent.
TTW00010801	I'll have my guards take him captive. If he cures my condition, I'll see to it that your reward is several times his value.
TTW00010802	He's all yours.
TTW00010803	It will be done.
TTW00010804	Head on back and see the boss real soon, hear? Evening.
TTW00010805	Time for the NCR to roast.
TTW00010806	Oh, to hell with this!
TTW00010807	I'm thinking I'm going to get a sweet Pre-War laser. What are you thinking?
TTW00010808	I'm thinking that I'm leaving because you are a sociopath. Good riddance.
TTW00010809	Oh, uh... whoops, I thought that was to turn it off.
TTW00010810	Argh, you moron! You're going to kill all of the troopers down there!
TTW00010811	That's it. I'm out. Good luck getting out of this place without being shot to pieces by NCR soldiers, assuming they aren't going to fry to death.
TTW00010812	I am a win-ner! I am a win-ner!
TTW00010813	Thanks for the warning.
TTW00010814	Be careful. You may want to talk to Lieutenant Hayes.
TTW00010815	He's in a tent down the road. Just stay on the west side of the overpass if you don't want to get shot.
TTW00010816	You'd think it was Spring the way tourists keep rolling in.
TTW00010817	That one's got a head on their shoulders. For now.
TTW00010818	Hope that tourist is hurrying, haven't got all day.
TTW00010819	At least this one seems like a straight shooter. Or sucker.
TTW00010820	That tourist crosses me, they'll regret it. Even if they don't, they still might.
TTW00010821	Should never have set that radio signal on repeat.
TTW00010822	Why are you so carved up - that a bear trap on your arm?
TTW00010823	Where the hell did you get this one. "Dog?" What, so you don't forget your name?
TTW00010824	End of line.
TTW00010825	Why pipe not break. Pipe. Break. Hnh. Leave it, not important.
TTW00010826	[Christine sniffs the air, then touches her neck and frowns. She gestures at the air and taps her wrist.]
TTW00010827	[The Hologram nods.]
TTW00010828	Do you have anything I can buy?
TTW00010829	[The Hologram flickers in acknowledgement.]
TTW00010830	Goodbye.
TTW00010831	[Christine nods at you, then the Ghost Person on the ground, makes a neck-chopping motion.]
TTW00010832	Better make sure he's dead. Poke him with a stick or something.
TTW00010833	Do you have anything to trade?
TTW00010834	Yes. Take a look.
TTW00010835	Here's 300 caps to cover the expenses.
TTW00010836	That should cover it. Hold on. This shouldn't take long.
TTW00010837	I need medical supplies.
TTW00010838	I can provide medical assistance. I can even use supplies that we have here, but I can't just sell what we have.
TTW00010839	I need to address problems as they arise, and most of those have to do with the Sorrows or Dead Horses.
TTW00010840	Take a look.
TTW00010841	-No matter how awful my day had been, he... he was always waiting there. How odd. My gel is de-coagulating.-
TTW00010842	-And when I would talk to him about Betsy - and how Marcus would beat on me and call me Smarty Sissy Pants, he'd just sit there, head on my knee.-
TTW00010843	-And...-
TTW00010844	-...-
TTW00010845	-If you don't mind, I'll take that bowl. Just... need to remove it. Put it away. Somewhere out of radar range.-
TTW00010846	-For some reason, its similarity to the Crater-shape of Big MT is starting to fill up all available cognitive spaces.-
TTW00010847	-That, combined with my own overwhelming feeling of having done something terrible... the two are hitting me with... unexpected force.-
TTW00010848	Um... maybe it's like a memory or something?
TTW00010849	[FAILED] -Oh, well it is of NO CONSEQUENCE. Gabe gave himself for Science! As we all have!-
TTW00010850	I'd like to buy some things.
TTW00010851	Very good, sir. If I might suggest a table wine, the 64 Atomic Claret is a lovely little vintage.
TTW00010852	Very good, sir. And might I venture to opine that a new Trilby might be just the thing to complete sir's ensemble?
TTW00010853	Very good, sir. Should sir be in the market for a new suit of morning wear, I have several suggestions that might suit.
TTW00010854	Very good, sir.
TTW00010855	You mean like this one?
TTW00010856	There ya go! Have fun with that. Burn the fuckin' world for me!
TTW00010857	I'm ready, let's do it.
TTW00010858	All right. Just try to relax, this won't hurt - unless your sense of self is especially vulnerable.
TTW00010859	I need my equipment repaired.
TTW00010860	Very good, sir.
TTW00010861	If... if you're really sure you want this, okay. Go ahead and stop the missile. And... goodbye.
TTW00010862	<Determined beeping>
TTW00010863	Come on. We're ending this. Right now.
TTW00010864	<Determined beeping>
TTW00010865	I had other questions.
TTW00010866	Questions have a habit of making others.
TTW00010867	What's the history of it?
TTW00010868	History? Cures a wound, leaves the bitterness that caused it. The Twin Mothers were always about lessons.
TTW00010869	Caesar taught them the last one, though, so that's it for them. Recipe still exists, Legion uses it on forced marches with wounded soldiers.
TTW00010870	Wouldn't have made it through Crimson River Trail a few years back without it - losing so much blood early on, was a Cazador feast.
TTW00010871	Enough Xander root and Broc flower along the trail though, the Legion was able to keep pace and get where they were going.
TTW00010872	Aww, I'm blushing!
TTW00010873	That's so nice of you to say! Thank you!
TTW00010874	Oh, you're embarrassing me!
TTW00010875	Why thank you!
TTW00010876	I'm not looking for trouble. I'm just here because of the radio signal.
TTW00010877	I heard your radio signal, and thought I'd come and lend a hand.
TTW00010878	Yeah, I had to kill a few of your guys to get a suit that looked good on me.
TTW00010879	I'm just looking for my dad.
TTW00010880	I'm just looking for my dad.
TTW00010881	Hang on. Is that some kind of computer on your wrist?
TTW00010882	I just stopped in to ransack the place. Didn't expect to find anyone.
TTW00010883	What, this armor? I found it. Honest.
TTW00010884	Hey, I just wandered in here, and it looked like you guys needed help.
TTW00010885	Sure, who wouldn't want to help out the surly guys in scary armor?
TTW00010886	That device on your wrist. That's not our tech.
TTW00010887	This is the part where I'd have you killed. At least, under normal circumstances.
TTW00010888	But, it turns out you might be useful to us. If you can help, I'll forget that you should be dead for wearing that armor.
TTW00010889	How did you know?
TTW00010890	That device on your wrist. That's not our tech. That, and the fact that none of us would be stupid enough to take our armor off.
TTW00010891	This is the part where I'd have you killed. At least, under normal circumstances.
TTW00010892	But, it turns out you might be useful to us. If you can help, I'll forget that you should be dead for wearing that armor.
TTW00010893	How did you know?
TTW00010894	No! No, no, no no. You want to talk crazy, do it someplace else. I'm keeping my mouth shut and following orders.
TTW00010895	I'm ready to change to Heavy Weapons gear.
TTW00010896	I'll just take care of all your old gear for you and here are the new ones.
TTW00010897	I'm ready to change to Sniper gear.
TTW00010898	I'll just take care of all your old gear for you and here are the new ones.
TTW00010899	Everything appears to be in order. Here you go.
TTW00010900	I'm ready for my Sniper gear. Here's my Requisition Holotape.
TTW00010901	I'm ready to change to Close Assault gear.
TTW00010902	I'll just take care of all your old gear for you and here are the new ones.
TTW00010903	Everything appears to be in order. Here you go.
TTW00010904	I'm ready for my Close Assault gear. Here's my Requisition Holotape.
TTW00010905	I'm ready to change to Fire Team gear.
TTW00010906	I'll just take care of all your old gear for you and here are the new ones.
TTW00010907	Hey, sorry. I'm just trying to figure out what's going on here.
TTW00010908	What's going on is this whole mission is one big rat-fuck. We've been stuck here for way too long with no results.
TTW00010909	McGraw won't give up, so we've stooped to using chumps like you to try and get something out of this place.
TTW00010910	Why exactly do you need me?
TTW00010911	Well, I suppose if you don't mind us hacking off your forearm, we don't really.
TTW00010912	The sim is looking for an external interface. I haven't quite figured out why, but there's no way to bypass it.
TTW00010913	Your Pip-Boy there is a match. So since you're the one wearing it, you're the one running through the simulation. Get it?
TTW00010914	Can you tell me more about what you're doing here?
TTW00010915	The same thing we always do. Recover technology and preserve it, making sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
TTW00010916	McGraw's hope is that whatever's in here will give us a big advantage. I'm not convinced, but I'm on his side.
TTW00010917	What can you tell me about this simulation?
TTW00010918	Eventually, the Americans went in and liberated the city, but there were heavy losses. This simulation trained soldiers for that engagement!
TTW00010919	Really, you must brush up on your history.
TTW00010920	You're dismissed from the Strike Team, soldier.
TTW00010921	Right away, sir.
TTW00010922	Send Team to Rally Point: Mines.
TTW00010923	Yes sir. On our way. We'll wait for you by the Mining Town.
TTW00010924	Wait for me just outside the Mining Town on the way to the Listening Post.
TTW00010925	Done with Ice Camp. Send Team to Rally Point: Chimera.
TTW00010926	Yes sir. On our way. We'll wait for you by the Chimera Depot.
TTW00010927	Now that the Ice Camp is out of the way, head up to the Chimera Depot.
TTW00010928	Done with Mines. Send Team to Rally Point: Listening Post.
TTW00010929	Yes sir. On our way. We'll wait for you by the Listening Post.
TTW00010930	Now that we've dealt with the Mining Town, head to the Listening Post.
TTW00010931	Well, it's about goddamned time.
TTW00010932	About damn time the reinforcements showed up! Fall in, soldier!
TTW00010933	We've got multiple hostiles between here and the base camp. We're sweeping the area to secure it. Let's move!
TTW00010934	Audio log begin.
TTW00010935	This is Captain Zachary Lloyd, United States Army, Anchorage, Alaska security detachment.
TTW00010936	Approximately 23 minutes ago, Chinese Communist forces set foot on Anchorage soil, despite our soldiers' best efforts to prevent that landing.
TTW00010937	As expected, the Chinese have launched a two-pronged attack - one aimed at occupying Anchorage proper, and the other at securing this base.
TTW00010938	Thanks to our entrenchment, U.S. casualties here on the mountain are currently minimal, but that's not going to last for long.
TTW00010939	We'll die today, but by God we'll give those Communist sonsabitches a black eye they'll never forget.
TTW00010940	Lloyd out.
TTW00010941	Okay, guess I'll get to it.
TTW00010942	Fine, great. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can leave.
TTW00010943	First you need to put on the Neural Interface suit, and then you can get going.
TTW00010944	You're fine now. Just be careful out there, all right?
TTW00010945	Maybe I'd better just go.
TTW00010946	Sure. See you around.
TTW00010947	Yeah, hell of a fight. Mind if I head in?
TTW00010948	Yeah, of course. Go on through.
TTW00010949	No problem, but your friend stays topside with me.
TTW00010950	No problem, but leave the bot here.
TTW00010951	Yeah, but Lyons' woman stays topside. You head in. Alone.
TTW00010952	Yeah, but make sure that stray pooch doesn't tag along.
TTW00010953	Yeah, of course. Go on through.
TTW00010954	Yeah, can I get by?
TTW00010955	Sure, but your pet Frankenstein stays here.
TTW00010956	Yeah, can I get by?
TTW00010957	No problem, but your friend stays topside with me.
TTW00010958	Yeah, can I get by?
TTW00010959	No problem, but leave the bot here.
TTW00010960	Yeah, can I get by?
TTW00010961	Yeah, but Lyons' woman stays topside. You head in. Alone.
TTW00010962	Yeah, can I get by?
TTW00010963	Yeah, but make sure that stray pooch doesn't tag along.
TTW00010964	Yeah, can I get by?
TTW00010965	Sure, but the zombie stays here.
TTW00010966	Yeah, can I get by?
TTW00010967	Morrill radioed ahead. I'm supposed to meet Protector McGraw.
TTW00010968	About time. Report to Protector McGraw, but leave your friend with me.
TTW00010969	Yeah, I'm headed down now.
TTW00010970	You've got some nerve bringing Lyons' bitch here. You go down. Alone.
TTW00010971	No dogs allowed. Head down, but leave the mutt with me.
TTW00010972	Yeah, exactly. They're in for a long haul.
TTW00010973	You'd think, but they're not like us. Their boys are drafted and left to rot on whatever shit assignment they're handed.
TTW00010974	No, no - it's not that at all. I get that the Chinese occupation in Alaska is strictly military, but don't you think they'd settle in a bit?
TTW00010975	Jesus, are these guys serious? Why would they bring that kind of hardware with them?
TTW00010976	I got word from brass at the Pentagon. We're going to need to modify the RoE on the Chinese to match this.
TTW00010977	We just got more field reports from DoD. Hey, Rick. You busy?
TTW00010978	Gary?
TTW00010979	Listen, son, I know Morrill was rough on you. I'm sorry, I really am -
TTW00010980	Gary? Gary?
TTW00010981	Right. You can drop the act, now. I'm not here to hurt you.
TTW00010982	Gary?
TTW00010983	<heavy sigh> Look, just remove the PIP-Boy and we can part ways.
TTW00010984	Gary? GARY!
TTW00010985	You know what? Fuck this. Hand me that saw - and turn off the recorder.
TTW00010986	Yes, I do. He's the one who brought me here.
TTW00010987	I appreciate your honesty. It's a rare virtue in this age.
TTW00010988	Wernher was my lieutenant until he betrayed me and escaped justice. And if I know him, he brought you here to steal something very dear to the city.
TTW00010989	Do you intend to follow through with his plan? Feel free to be honest. Please, don't be intimidated by the turret behind you.
TTW00010990	I'm just here to kill you and reap the profits.
TTW00010991	I figured it'd be something like that. Goodbye, new blood.
TTW00010992	I'm the badass who'll be running this place once I kill you.
TTW00010993	I figured it'd be something like that. Goodbye, new blood.
TTW00010994	I'm the hero who's going to kill you and free the slaves!
TTW00010995	Watch where you're going, meat!
TTW00010996	Just head back and talk to Sandra. She'll explain all about the cure. Then you'll see why you have to put an end to Wernher.
TTW00010997	I suggest you forget Wernher's offer, and consider mine: stop Wernher, and you'll have a bright future in The Pitt. Don't disappoint me, new blood.
TTW00010998	That's an interesting way to put it. But yes, I suppose the city's future does rest squarely upon it.
TTW00010999	Something tells me you won't want the responsibility that comes with it.
TTW00011000	He said you had the key to ruling the city, and I'm here to collect.
TTW00011001	Easy enough. You could say no because he lied to you.
TTW00011002	My discovery is a miracle, but it isn't the type that sets slaves free.
TTW00011003	He said your discovery will free the slaves and cure them. How could I say no?
TTW00011004	Oh, it's valuable. I'd say there's nothing I care more about in the world.
TTW00011005	But Wernher doesn't truly appreciate everything it means to me, or to The Pitt.
TTW00011006	He wanted me to steal a valuable cure. I'm just in it for the caps.
TTW00011007	Nap time's over, asshole. On your feet!
TTW00011008	Now, stay still while mommy takes a few readings. Don't worry, dear, you're perfectly safe!
TTW00011009	You want to die, asshole? Back to it!
TTW00011010	What am I trying to get?
TTW00011011	The bosses have the key to the cure. With it, we can take control of the city and free my people.
TTW00011012	Why can't you do it?
TTW00011013	They know that I know about the cure. All of them will be looking for me by now. That's why those guys came all the way here.
TTW00011014	I came here because I needed an outsider. Someone like you, who has the strength to pull off what I need.
TTW00011015	What's your goal?
TTW00011016	The city is controlled by a man named Ashur. He's powerful. No one there dares go against him. No one except me.
TTW00011017	I need you to sneak into The Pitt and find a way to get close enough to him to steal the cure. Nothing to it, right?
TTW00011018	Who is that down there? I can't see a fuckin' thing. Open up the gate, it might be one of those slaves.
TTW00011019	Hang on. Someone's coming. Let me do the talking.
TTW00011020	Hey, hey! What are you guys doing here?
TTW00011021	Think of it as clearing the stage. The cure in this brat's genes is the only thing worth keeping, and now we can wipe that hellhole clean.
TTW00011022	And that takes us to the last part of the plan: letting the Trogs overrun Uptown, killing every last bastard in there.
TTW00011023	Leaving you to take Ashur's place.
TTW00011024	It's here and safe. How's this going to put me in charge of The Pitt?
TTW00011025	It means that we can study Ashur's bastard, and once we dig the cure out of it, make sure that we all get the treatment.
TTW00011026	Leaving the slaves free, and turning the bosses into Trog food!
TTW00011027	The baby's here, and she's safe. How will this help the slaves?
TTW00011028	Did you know the cure is actually a baby?
TTW00011029	She's not just any baby. She holds the promise of a cure for our own children, and we can ransom her back for our freedom.
TTW00011030	Don't think I enjoy this any more than you. But it's the only way we can be free and healthy enough to leave.
TTW00011031	Seems like an awful lot of fuss over one little baby.
TTW00011032	I'm not so sure this was the right thing to do.
TTW00011033	Of course, she'll be safe. We're just going to do our own research for the cure, and then ransom her back for our freedom.
TTW00011034	You've seen how Ashur and his people treat us. It's far, far kinder than they deserve.
TTW00011035	I don't feel right about kidnapping. She's going to be safe, right?
TTW00011036	Did you know the cure is actually a baby?
TTW00011037	Oh, now I see how it is! Think you're going to become Ashur's new lieutenant, do you? Maybe wait until you can take his throne?
TTW00011038	I've seen your type come and go, and they always leave town face down in the river.
TTW00011039	So, fine. You picked your side, and you made your choice. See where that takes you.
TTW00011040	I joined with the winning side. Now shut your mouth, slave.
TTW00011041	You didn't really expect me to steal a baby, did you?
TTW00011042	We're just supposed to live and die in slavery, and watch our children turn into monsters, all because you don't have the balls to do your job?
TTW00011043	Wake up, you simple-headed sap. That baby could do more good for us than all of his mongrel raider family ever did for us combined.
TTW00011044	Sorry, but I just couldn't kidnap an innocent baby, even for your freedom.
TTW00011045	The Bear Brothers are dead! Amazing! This newcomer is showing promise, my friends!
TTW00011046	Let's find out if the newcomer can hold his own against real fighters! Release! Fight!
TTW00011047	And there is only one left standing! Only one! Oh, my friends! What a fantastic fight! How far will this slave go?
TTW00011048	Now, are they ready to die for their chance at freedom? Let's find out! Release the barrels! Fight!
TTW00011049	And now, my friends, we have for you a group of slaves willing to kill and slaughter in order to become one of we privileged few!
TTW00011050	They will fight! They will die! And all for you! All for your entertainment!
TTW00011051	Let's do it!
TTW00011052	Well all right! That's what I like to hear! Get on in there!
TTW00011053	Well all right! That's what I like to hear! Get on in there!
TTW00011054	If you're ready, just step on in.
TTW00011055	Who among you will risk your life in the crucible to create a new life of freedom in Uptown? Who will take this rare chance to thrive?
TTW00011056	Citizens of The Pitt, workers of Downtown, traders of Uptown, and all fierce souls who do what must be done!
TTW00011057	I bring you good news! We stand at the dawn of a new golden age. Where others merely survive, we thrive!
TTW00011058	Our industry is the envy of the Commonwealth! Our safety is the envy of the Capital Wastes! Our might is the envy of Ronto!
TTW00011059	And while I have led your efforts, it has been by your own strength that you have earned all of the envy of the world.
TTW00011060	They envy the steel shaped by the workers in our mills, and they envy the strength of our traders and raiders who wield that steel for The Pitt.
TTW00011061	And most of all, they envy our victories in the struggle for freedom. Because, yes, freedom is what we all work towards.
TTW00011062	Freedom from fear, freedom from disease, freedom to live as once we did before we were shackled by atomic fire!
TTW00011063	And so, to celebrate this struggle, I ask my loyal workers: who among you is prepared to fight for your freedom?
TTW00011064	Anthony's sick. He sent me to take his place.
TTW00011065	Yes, you'd think that, wouldn't you? But that's because you're an idiot who thinks he can get away with kidnapping Ashur's daughter.
TTW00011066	Our raiders will tear you apart, and when they're done, Marie will be playing with your bones as a rattle.
TTW00011067	That means kidnapping this baby is the key to ruling this city. Yoink!
TTW00011068	And you really think the slaves can develop a cure more efficiently than I can? Don't be an idiot.
TTW00011069	And if they so much as pluck one hair off her head, I'll be sure to pluck one eye out of each of theirs.
TTW00011070	So maybe you should just put her back right this instant and tell those miserable bastards that they can wait until their goddamned turn.
TTW00011071	Sorry, but the slaves don't have time to wait for a cure. I'm taking Marie.
TTW00011072	You don't even know how dead you are, do you?
TTW00011073	So, I'm just supposed to strangle them with my bare hands if I meet one?
TTW00011074	I can't really help you there. Ask around. Maybe check with Marco in the Mill. He's been making some of our tools into weapons.
TTW00011075	So where can I get some weapons?
TTW00011076	I can't really help you there. Ask around. Maybe check with Marco in the Mill. He's been making some of our tools into weapons.
TTW00011077	One chance, Wernher. Leave now, and never come back.
TTW00011078	Oh, I see how it is. You signed on with Ashur, and now you're going to stand by your man. Maybe trying to catch his eye and be his queen?
TTW00011079	Well, good luck with that, starfucker. I'm sure the two of you will kill each other eventually, even without my help.
TTW00011080	You, him, and this whole town can burn for all I care. I'm gone.
TTW00011081	Wernher, how about saving us both a lot of trouble and leaving quietly?
TTW00011082	Sure, fine. Obviously, you've joined with Ashur and I think you've got a bright future as a lackey. You really do.
TTW00011083	But you know what? Fuck this city, and fuck the raiders, fuck the slaves, and fuck you too, fucker. I'm gone.
TTW00011084	I want to fight in the Arena.
TTW00011085	Oh yeah? You sure you're ready to die?
TTW00011086	No thanks, I'll pass.
TTW00011087	That's probably for the best.
TTW00011088	Go! Get him! Get the traitor!
TTW00011089	Just shut up and listen to me. You want to get out of this shithole or not? Look, I need your decision. You with us?
TTW00011090	Okay, break's over.
TTW00011091	Yes, sir!
TTW00011092	Now, I've got a very important meeting with our new friend, so if anything big comes up, you use the intercom.
TTW00011093	All right, all right. Put your guards on alert, tell them to be on the lookout for anyone loitering too long downtown.
TTW00011094	Whatever we call them, they've been gathering makeshift weapons.
TTW00011095	We call them "workers." Helps with morale, reminds them they might earn their freedom, someday.
TTW00011096	What?
TTW00011097	"Workers."
TTW00011098	Sir, we've had sightings of Wernher back in the city, and there's been an increase in chatter between slaves.
TTW00011099	No, but I may heal the infirm later in the week. Time permitting, of course.
TTW00011100	And I suppose you'll follow that up by raising the dead?
TTW00011101	I'll be with you, right after I maintain some order and dispense a little justice.
TTW00011102	And I'm telling you, I've got it covered.
TTW00011103	I'm telling you, they're planning something!
TTW00011104	Come on, we're almost there. It's just past this gate.
TTW00011105	Man, me and you need to get one of those uninfected scab whores, get her shitfaced, and just see what happens.
TTW00011106	Well then, I hope you also said goodbye! HAHAHAHA! Alright, play time's over. Get to work, grinders.
TTW00011107	Yes sir. I told him what he needs to do. He knows. 10 ingots. As fast as he can.
TTW00011108	Yes sir. I told her what she needs to do. She knows. 10 ingots. As fast as she can.
TTW00011109	Oh yeah? So he's the one that's going out to the Steelyard, huh?
TTW00011110	Oh yeah? So she's the one that's going out to the Steelyard, huh?
TTW00011111	I need a weapon. Where can I find Marco?
TTW00011112	You're looking for Marco, hrm? What's he up to?
TTW00011113	He's over in the Mill. I don't see him except for meals.
TTW00011114	I tried. Really I did. This is your own fault.
TTW00011115	The rest of you are dismissed.
TTW00011116	Very well, Midea. If that is the will of the workers, then this man shall be their champion!
TTW00011117	Prepare yourself, sir. And when you are ready to be forged anew, report to Faydra in the Steel Mill.
TTW00011118	Very well, Midea. If that is the will of the workers, then this woman shall be their champion!
TTW00011119	Sir, you carry not only the dream that workers can become free, but that we may all someday become truly free from the threats of our world.
TTW00011120	Madam, you carry not only the dream that workers can become free, but that we may all someday become truly free from the threats of our world.
TTW00011121	Prepare yourself, Madam. And when you are ready to be forged anew, report to Faydra in the Steel Mill.
TTW00011122	Right here! We have one! This woman here will fight in the Hole!
TTW00011123	Right here! We have one! This man here will fight in the Hole!
TTW00011124	C'mon, Ashur! Will you send someone to the Hole who actually stands a chance?
TTW00011125	All workers report to the Square. All workers report to the Square.
TTW00011126	Only one will walk out with their freedom! Only one will walk out alive! Release the barrels! GO!
TTW00011127	And now, this slave has proven willing to kill and die for his freedom! But how will he fare against the last man who made it all the way: Gruber!
TTW00011128	And now, this slave has proven willing to kill and die for her freedom! But how will she fare against the man who made it all the way: Gruber!
TTW00011129	Undefeated in the Hole, Gruber has yet to meet his match.
TTW00011130	C'mon, coward!
TTW00011131	Let me see what drinks you have.
TTW00011132	It hurts my heart to see a sober customer.
TTW00011133	If you walk out of here sober, I'm not doing my job.
TTW00011134	Oh, good! And here I thought you were planning to stay sober.
TTW00011135	Show me what you've got.
TTW00011136	You'd best not be wasting my time, newbie.
TTW00011137	Yeah sure, newbie.
TTW00011138	Sure thing, newbie.
TTW00011139	Yeah, fine. I was just kidding.
TTW00011140	You're a real joker, aren't you? Whatever. Listen, I come from a place called The Pitt. It's a city far to the northwest.
TTW00011141	No big deal, right? It's a rough world. Who cares? But I have the chance to free them. I just need an outsider's help before we lose that chance.
TTW00011142	Here come more of them! Watch out!
TTW00011143	Hey! There's someone in the pen! Get 'em!
TTW00011144	And how am I supposed to get out of there?
TTW00011145	Sorry, doll, but I'll be busy setting everything up with the squirt, here. But for you, I guess I can spare a few supplies.
TTW00011146	Head down there, find the floodlight controls, and turn off Uptown's floodlights. I'll meet you back Downtown.
TTW00011147	Sounds dangerous. How about helping a lady out?
TTW00011148	Hey! Hands off the merchandise!
TTW00011149	Who's Wild Bill?
TTW00011150	Bill's a friend of mine, a very dear friend. We've worked the mill together for a long time.
TTW00011151	Last week we were forced to choose someone to gather ingots from the Steelyard. Bill volunteered.
TTW00011152	You look like you can handle yourself. Could you look for him and bring him back?
TTW00011153	I need you to repair some equipment.
TTW00011154	Sure thing, newbie.
TTW00011155	Who's Wild Bill again?
TTW00011156	Bill's a friend of mine, a very dear friend. We've worked the mill together for a long time.
TTW00011157	Last week we were forced to choose someone to gather ingots from the Steelyard. Bill volunteered.
TTW00011158	No, I don't want to help.
TTW00011159	Well, okay. I hope you'll change your mind.
TTW00011160	No, I haven't seen him.
TTW00011161	No? Well, if you do see him, could you let me know?
TTW00011162	Ashur's new pet is looking for a beating!
TTW00011163	Oh, that's it! RIOT!
TTW00011164	Bill said to let you know he's OK, but he can't come back anytime soon. <Lie.>
TTW00011165	As long as I know he's okay, then that's all that matters. Thank you for your help. I'll tell the others that Bill is alright.
TTW00011166	Here, take these stimpaks. They're all I have. Goodbye.
TTW00011167	Bill's dead. I found his body in the Steelyard. I'm sorry, Milly.
TTW00011168	Thank you for your help. Here, take these stimpaks. They're all I have.
TTW00011169	Yes, I found him in the Steelyard.
TTW00011170	Oh! That's wonderful! Where is he now? Did he come back with you?
TTW00011171	I'm just kidding, I found Bill dead in the Steelyard.
TTW00011172	Here, take these stimpaks. They're all I have. Goodbye.
TTW00011173	Please, please stop. I can't hear anymore of it. I don't feel so well.
TTW00011174	Hey, that's my stuff. Get your fuckin' hands off of it.
TTW00011175	You're sure he can't come?
TTW00011176	Yeah. I'm sure. You can hook up with her again when you get back.
TTW00011177	Now c'mon. Let's get going.
TTW00011178	You're sure she can't come?
TTW00011179	If that's how it has to be, I understand.
TTW00011180	Yeah. That's the way it is. You can hook up with her again when you get back.
TTW00011181	Now c'mon. Let's get going.
TTW00011182	This doesn't sound good.
TTW00011183	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011184	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011185	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011186	Besides, we don't need some burnt out old loser tagging along. He'll only slow us down.
TTW00011187	We won't be able to maintain him on the road.
TTW00011188	Besides, we don't need some bucket of bolts tagging along. He'll only get in the way.
TTW00011189	We only have enough supplies for two. She's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011190	Besides, this might turn ugly. We don't need some do-gooder slowing us down.
TTW00011191	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011192	Besides, we don't need a... uhm... whatever he is tagging along with us. He'll only draw attention.
TTW00011193	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011194	Besides, this might turn ugly. We don't need some do-gooder slowing us down.
TTW00011195	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011196	Besides, we don't need some greaser tagging along with us. He'll only get in the way.
TTW00011197	We only have enough supplies for two. She's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011198	Besides, we don't need some diseased whore tagging along with us. She'll only get in the way.
TTW00011199	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011200	Besides, we don't need come filthy mutt tagging along with us. He'll only get in the way.
TTW00011201	Oh, good. I love surprises. What is it?
TTW00011202	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011203	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011204	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011205	Besides, we don't need some burnt out old loser tagging along. He'll only slow us down.
TTW00011206	We're not going to be able to keep him maintained while we're on the road.
TTW00011207	Besides, we don't need some bucket of bolts tagging along. He'll only get in the way.
TTW00011208	We only have enough supplies for two. She's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011209	Besides, this might turn ugly. We don't need some do-gooder slowing us down.
TTW00011210	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011211	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011212	Besides, this might turn ugly. We don't need some do-gooder slowing us down.
TTW00011213	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011214	Besides, we don't need some greaser tagging along with us. He'll only get in the way.
TTW00011215	We only have enough supplies for two. She's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011216	Besides, we don't need some diseased whore tagging along with us. She'll only get in the way.
TTW00011217	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
TTW00011218	Besides, we don't need some filthy mutt tagging along with us. He'll only get in the way.
TTW00011219	He just expects me to jump to attention?
TTW00011220	No, he expects you to accept his courteous invitation. Or at least to guess what would happen if you keep him waiting.
TTW00011221	You'll find him in Haven, his tower in Uptown. Take the northeast exit from here and look for the tallest building in town.
TTW00011222	Oh, Ashur also said that he has a few gifts for you. You'll find them in the container behind me.
TTW00011223	Enjoy. And don't keep the man waiting.
TTW00011224	Where can I find Ashur?
TTW00011225	He watches over the city from Haven, his tower in Uptown. Take the northeast exit from here and look for the tallest building in town.
TTW00011226	Oh, Ashur also said that he has a few gifts for you. You'll find them in the container behind me.
TTW00011227	Enjoy. And don't keep the man waiting.
TTW00011228	I'm a slave. I couldn't make it out there. Let me back in. <Lie.>
TTW00011229	HAHA! I love it. Another slave wandered back here, huh? You couldn't even get over the bridge, could you? You're lucky I don't fuckin' paste you.
TTW00011230	And look at all this! Where'd you get all this shit anyway? Whatever. Mine now. I hit the fuckin' jackpot today!
TTW00011231	Now get back in there and get to work, or next time I'll just stake you out there for the Trogs.
TTW00011232	Okay, got it. Let's go!
TTW00011233	Never mind. I'm fine without it.
TTW00011234	You head down to the hole. Talk to Faydra. She sets up the fights.
TTW00011235	I think I can handle it.
TTW00011236	If you need a weapon, check with Marco in the Mill. He's been making some of our tools into weapons.
TTW00011237	Hey, that's Ashur's kid! Sound the alarm!
TTW00011238	Oooh!
TTW00011239	How about I put you to the whip, huh?
TTW00011240	Guess I couldn't stop you, but then you'd never find all the little bonuses I got stashed over the years.
TTW00011241	How about this: you bring me ingots, like you used to, and I'll make sure you get compensated when you do. Can't be more fair than that.
TTW00011242	No hard feelings, but I'm not taking any more of your shit.
TTW00011243	Understood, champ! But if you want to keep collecting ingots, I still got plenty of gear stashed away.
TTW00011244	You bring me ingots, I'll make sure you get rewarded. Can't be more fair than that.
TTW00011245	You got anything for me?
TTW00011246	Guess I could spare this.
TTW00011247	I need you to start the purifier. The code is 2-1-6.
TTW00011248	Is there any way I can help?
TTW00011249	Indeed, we can use every able body available to us.
TTW00011250	To that end, I am going to circumvent our standard recruitment procedures and declare you a Knight of the Brotherhood of Steel.
TTW00011251	Before you do anything else, please speak with Scribe Rothchild. I'm sure he'll be pleased to see you again.
TTW00011252	He can brief you on the details of the last few weeks, as well as where our efforts are focused now.
TTW00011253	I understand that you've been through quite an ordeal, but the sooner you can talk to him, the sooner we can put an end to all this.
TTW00011254	I know. We run out in two days and then it's back to the radiated shit.
TTW00011255	What the hell is going on?
TTW00011256	You think maybe Megaton is trying to con you out of more water?
TTW00011257	I don't know WHAT to think. I got Lyons breathing down my neck about it though.
TTW00011258	Apparently Megaton's sending him nasty letters demanding a shipment. I JUST sent them a week's supply! A month's, if they ration.
TTW00011259	Look, if you can straighten out Megaton so I get Lyons off my back, I'll make it worth your while.
TTW00011260	Sounds like you have your hands full.
TTW00011261	Everyone was so excited about that Purifier: "Project Purity this," and "Project Purity that."
TTW00011262	But did anyone stop to ask, "Hey, what are we going to DO with all that clean water?" Well, guess who gets to fill in that tiny detail.
TTW00011263	It'd be one thing if I had support, but that little war with the Enclave has depleted much of the Brotherhood's resources.
TTW00011264	And to top it off, I have to be mommy to a bunch of lab coats.
TTW00011265	What is it now?!
TTW00011266	If Lyons wants to chase after his deliveries, fine. Let HIM do it. But I'm done wasting resources and risking lives on this pet project of his.
TTW00011267	I wish. But no, I need them. They're some of the few that bothered to come back at all - a hardy bunch, this group. Almost as good as our own men.
TTW00011268	That's why I'm here, actually. Bigsley sent me.
TTW00011269	Oh, he did? I was beginning to think he forgot about us.
TTW00011270	Not sure how much you know: There's been an increase in attacks on the caravans. Seems organized and not just the random Raider or Mutant encounter.
TTW00011271	I'm running out of resources and I'm down to my greenest men. I want to get to the bottom of these coordinated attacks. The sooner the better.
TTW00011272	I'm your worst nightmare!
TTW00011273	That so? You're one of the newbies? You best know the pass phrase asshole. Or you're dead.
TTW00011274	Got a free sample I could try?
TTW00011275	Ladies and gentlemen, DING-DING-DING! We have a new winner in our daily Aqua Cura Sweepstakes! Here you go, sir. Your FREE bottle!
TTW00011276	Step right up in the next 5 minutes, and get your VERY OWN bottle of the Amazing Aqua Cura at HALF price! Ladies and gentlemen. Half price!
TTW00011277	Ladies and gentlemen, DING-DING-DING! We have a new winner in our daily Aqua Cura Sweepstakes! Here you go, ma'am. Your FREE bottle!
TTW00011278	Step right up in the next 5 minutes, and get your VERY OWN bottle of the Amazing Aqua Cura at HALF price! Ladies and gentlemen. Half price!
TTW00011279	Relax. I don't care. Take these morons for all their worth. I'm just curious.
TTW00011280	It's true, I got a thing going.
TTW00011281	I take the Aqua Pura, store it to sell to humans later, then I put the regular irradiated crap in the bottles and sell it to these fools.
TTW00011282	No one's getting hurt. In fact, the Brotherhood actually needs the caps and technology I give them to fund their "free" water caravans.
TTW00011283	Just ask Bigsley at Project Purity, he'll tell you how grateful he is I'm helping them out like this.
TTW00011284	Heheh. You're not fooling anyone. Everyone knows you're one of the good guys.
TTW00011285	But seriously kid. I'm not up to anything. Just ask any of these fools - ahem - I mean, LOYAL customers.
TTW00011286	They already see the many benefits of the Amazing Aqua Cura!
TTW00011287	I'm definitely getting a bottle!
TTW00011288	I'm getting a case for my family.
TTW00011289	Oh wow! That sounds great!
TTW00011290	That IS Amazing!
TTW00011291	It's unbelievable!
TTW00011292	Whoa!
TTW00011293	That's terrific!
TTW00011294	Who would've thought?
TTW00011295	I can't believe it does ALL that! That's wonderful!
TTW00011296	Amazing! Simply amazing.
TTW00011297	Wow!
TTW00011298	Friends, have you stopped combing your hair? Afraid of pulling out the few remaining plugs?
TTW00011299	Please, water. I'm so thirsty.
TTW00011300	Oh, poor dear. Here, I've got some water I can spare.
TTW00011301	No, bless you. I'm glad to help.
TTW00011302	It's been confirmed. The Purifier has been activated. We've been ordered to fortify our current position and wait for orders.
TTW00011303	With a lull in the fighting, we set up and fortified our position outside the Capitol Building, near Seward Square.
TTW00011304	Things have been relatively quiet around here lately. That'll all change when word spreads of the purifier.
TTW00011305	Anyone and everyone will do whatever they can to get there hands on some of that water. For life or profit, it makes no difference.
TTW00011306	Same old killing, just a different ingredient.
TTW00011307	We've been in position for a couple of days now. No sign of the caravans. This is bullshit! I want some god damn water.
TTW00011308	I'm gonna kill Jed for putting us girls through this shit. Why get close to the caravan when we could just blow 'em away from a distance?
TTW00011309	He says we need the ammunition and can't afford to lose anybody. "Just use your good looks or something", he says. What an ass.
TTW00011310	Hahaha!
TTW00011311	Please! Don't shoot!
TTW00011312	Yeah, I killed him. But I'm here to set up a "protection" deal with the gang.
TTW00011313	What?!
TTW00011314	Not good enough. Give me your caps, or I'll take them from your corpse.
TTW00011315	Just don't hurt me, alright? Here's all my caps.
TTW00011316	I don't got shit for you to take. Honest man. My pockets are empty.
TTW00011317	Ha. I might of believed you were capable of that. But everyone knows you're a softy.
TTW00011318	Oh god, somebody help!
TTW00011319	The robot is our best weapon. If we can keep it running, we have a chance. If not, we have to find another way to counter their Vertibirds.
TTW00011320	It's a necessary move, but yeah. If the attack fails, they're going to come at us hard.
TTW00011321	We've been able to steamroll the Enclave so far, but how do you think this is going to end? Can we really defeat them?
TTW00011322	I'm trying to stay positive, but losing the robot was a huge blow. Do you think we'll still be able to pull through this?
TTW00011323	Still working on decrypting the Enclave data pulled from the last encounter. We should have solid results soon.
TTW00011324	And, as I've said with each and every purchase: "All sales are final." Eheh.
TTW00011325	I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that violence won't be necessary.
TTW00011326	Little Sister, I've stashed away a considerable amount of fuel behind the small building west of the Air Traffic Control Tower as you requested.
TTW00011327	The container's tucked away under some barrels and tires. And no, I couldn't safely confiscate an Incinerator for you, that's your job.
TTW00011328	I took too big a risk hiding that fuel for you in the first place. If you do come across an Incinerator, please be careful.
TTW00011329	Anyway, they're shipping me out to some relay station far west of here in the Wasteland. I'm afraid I won't be seeing you for awhile.
TTW00011330	Take care and good luck in all your endeavors. Your Big Brother.
TTW00011331	So get your glasses ready, children. This round's on me.
TTW00011332	As I speak, the Brotherhood is working with Rivet City security to get that fresh water to the Wasteland. The caravans are coming!
TTW00011333	God, ain't that beautiful? But even better, it's finally happened! The water is clean, and hell yes, it's free! Just a little patience, children.
TTW00011334	See, she was a scientist too, worked on that project. You know what she wanted? "The waters of life. Free and clean, for any and all."
TTW00011335	Now you all remember James, right? Father of 101? Well, Three Dog has learned that back in the day, James' wife had a dream.
TTW00011336	Two weeks. It's been two weeks since our boys in Power Armor kicked those Enclave bastards out of Project Purity, and started that baby chugging.
TTW00011337	Three Dog's advice? If you've got one of those Mister Dandy butler bots, have him make you some purified water, and count yourself lucky.
TTW00011338	The water going 'round may be free, but it sure as hell ain't clean. So when you see that caravan comin', tell 'em to keep on going.
TTW00011339	Coincidence? Three Dog thinks not. For all their good intentions, it looks like those eggheads at the Jefferson Memorial screwed up royally.
TTW00011340	It also happens that this new illness ONLY started showin' up AFTER the Brotherhood started distributing so-called "clean" water from that purifier.
TTW00011341	Experience would tell ya this is your garden variety radiation sickness, but nuh uh. This is something else, children. Something worse. Much worse.
TTW00011342	People are gettin' sick. Sicker than usual, I mean. Weakness, nausea, you name it. Even a couple of deaths reported.
TTW00011343	All righty, children, time to let you know about yet another problem plaguing our tranquil little post-apocalyptic neighborhood.
TTW00011344	The Enclave's been responsible for enough death and destruction. We need to get back to normal. You know, like fighting Raiders and Super Mutants.
TTW00011345	You know, some laser beams here, a few exploded corpses there. Let's just hope this mop up operation ends ASAP.
TTW00011346	But the fight, dear children, did not end there. The Brotherhood has been pursuing "President" Eden's little minions throughout the Wasteland.
TTW00011347	It's been some time since those plucky paladins in Power Armor first stormed the Jefferson Memorial and gave the Enclave their walking papers.
TTW00011348	There's something jamming the control frequency!
TTW00011349	Releasing Deathclaw!
TTW00011350	I've got blood samples to turn in.
TTW00011351	Good job. I'll inform Lyons of your progress.
TTW00011352	Fantastic. I'll get the Scribes to record your kills.
TTW00011353	Nice work. Come back when you have more.
TTW00011354	Great! Keep them coming.
TTW00011355	I found some Sensor Modules for you.
TTW00011356	Ah, very nice. I'll have my assembling team get right on it.
TTW00011357	We'll need a lot more where this came from to reconstruct Prime's electrical systems. Keep bringing more.
TTW00011358	It's but a drop in the bucket, but it'll have to do. Thanks.
TTW00011359	I have Cameras for you, Scribe Rothchild.
TTW00011360	Oh, splendid! Hopefully these will contain unbroken lenses unlike the last few I've acquired.
TTW00011361	Excellent! I'll begin disassembling them immediately. Good work!
TTW00011362	What's wrong? What did the letter say?
TTW00011363	Obadiah Blackhall sent me. I have a letter.
TTW00011364	Obadiah sent you? Well, then, let's see what he has to say.
TTW00011365	(Pauses to read note)
TTW00011366	Obadiah Blackhall sent me. I have a letter.
TTW00011367	What do you expect me to do?
TTW00011368	We must get it back before the Krvibi learn anything from it.
TTW00011369	I'll do it, Obadiah. There's no reason for you to die.
TTW00011370	What are you talking about?
TTW00011371	This isn't some ordinary book we can toss in a fire and be done with. I can destroy it here and now, but the ritual requires a sacrifice.
TTW00011372	They'll kill me anyway. Now that they've possessed the book, they'll do anything to get it back.
TTW00011373	There must be something we can do. We have the book.
TTW00011374	<Show him the Book.>
TTW00011375	I'll be bloody well damned. She was right. It's back.
TTW00011376	The Krvibi had it, I took it, and now she's dead.
TTW00011377	You have it? God help us; you do. That damned book is back, and this time it'll be the death of me.
TTW00011378	Marcella? Why? She's done nothing to them!
TTW00011379	They killed her, Obadiah. I'm sorry.
TTW00011380	What good are you, then? Take her that letter; she's the only person who might know how to help me.
TTW00011381	I haven't seen her yet.
TTW00011382	Good job blocking off that hole! Hurry and get in here! It looks like they are about to breach from the East wing!
TTW00011383	Hurry! Get in there before more of them come out! Find where they are coming from and stop them. Just like before I'll be keeping an eye out.
TTW00011384	That's one less way for them to get in. Follow me. I think we are about to get hit hard.
TTW00011385	Yeah, here they come. Grab all the ammo and stimpaks you need. This is gonna be a rough one!
TTW00011386	They've been at it all night. I think they are just about to breach the inner walls. Follow me. I'm going to go check it out.
TTW00011387	It looks like they are coming in from somewhere upstairs. Hurry, follow me!
TTW00011388	Go through these doors and up the stairs. Find where they are coming in and stop them. I'll be keeping an eye on the cameras down here. Hurry!
TTW00011389	Tell me about the mine, Kenny.
TTW00011390	Old Man Herzog's Mine-hole? Isn't much, but it's home!
TTW00011391	Tell me about this mine, Kenny.
TTW00011392	This is Caroline Saunders, principal geological chemist, for Bysshe natural gas survey MD-16-001.
TTW00011393	Sample set one shows promising concentration of bio-gas in mostly limestone substratum of wetlands.
TTW00011394	No exact levels yet, but this site should exhibit more than enough extraction potential to meet survey goals.
TTW00011395	I'm going to leave a couple of interns here to handle the minutiae, but it's a formality.
TTW00011396	I'll move on to the other sites now to make sure this isn't an aberration. Consider this my authorization signature on Sample Site One.
TTW00011397	Hey! Over here!
TTW00011398	Ok, any second now. Get ready!
TTW00011399	Here they come! Second floor, on the right!
TTW00011400	More of them! On the right, first floor!
TTW00011401	The door on the left! First floor!
TTW00011402	They're at the front door! Get ready!
TTW00011403	That looks like the last of 'em. You're a pretty good shot.
TTW00011404	Does this tonic really cure anything at all?
TTW00011405	Oh, just about whatever ails you, sweetie! A real cure-all. Say, I don't reckon you're the dry type, is you? Oh, never mind.
TTW00011406	Why exactly should I help you, again?
TTW00011407	Well, I don't rightly expect you to help me out of goodness, though I welcome you to prove me wrong, sweetie.
TTW00011408	When we brew this batch of tonic up, you'll have rights to a share for yourself, and a payday of 300 caps to boot.
TTW00011409	What now?
TTW00011410	We got everything. Now we wait while it brews. Three days should do the trick.
TTW00011411	Yeah, I can fix it. No charge.
TTW00011412	Aren't you a smart one? Sweeter tonic's better for both of us, after all.
TTW00011413	I'll get it working like new, but I want 200 caps.
TTW00011414	I reckon you've got a deal, sweetie, but I'd better notice a difference in the tonic.
TTW00011415	I can fix it up. Let's call it 100 caps of work?
TTW00011416	I reckon I can scrape that together. Go ahead and do what you can for it.
TTW00011417	Your still could stand to be fixed up.
TTW00011418	Could it, now? I suppose you'd know how to see to that, wouldn't you?
TTW00011419	Did you build that still yourself?
TTW00011420	That old thing's been in my family for years and years.
TTW00011421	Well before the bombs, there was a time folks couldn't get no tonic by law, and my family did okay helping them get what they needed.
TTW00011422	I want to know more about you.
TTW00011423	Why, I'm just folk. What more is there?
TTW00011424	Let's talk about this tonic.
TTW00011425	Oh, you're gonna love it, sweetie. Just you wait.
TTW00011426	I'm sorry, I guess I just haven't heard of that illness. Maybe I can help.
TTW00011427	I reckon you can, at that. I just need some help brewing up a little tonic.
TTW00011428	You're sick? What's the matter?
TTW00011429	Go to the bank and use password xìn tian weng. The software is configured to recognize only our voices.
TTW00011430	So? It's smoke. Things burn down all the time. Especially around me.
TTW00011431	That smoke's coming from old Calvert Mansion. I always heard it was haunted, but more importantly, I always heard it was full of Pre-War treasure!
TTW00011432	I know I said Point Lookout was perfect for treasure hunters, but it's a rare day when you get a beacon like that!
TTW00011433	Why did you run away from home, Kenny?
TTW00011434	I wasn't born right. Mama hid me in the basement and pappy kinda just forgot about me, but I knew I had to go before I grew up.
TTW00011435	Come over here, boy. Let's talk.
TTW00011436	Come over here, girl. Let's talk.
TTW00011437	I was just admiring the architecture. I didn't mean any offense.
TTW00011438	You're in Blackhall Manor. This isn't a tourist attraction, but I appreciate your good taste. Come, let's talk.
TTW00011439	I was just admiring the architecture. I didn't mean any offense.
TTW00011440	Okay. I'll go get it for you.
TTW00011441	Gee, thanks! I dropped him near the shaft, so he's probably at the bottom.
TTW00011442	What should I be doing again?
TTW00011443	I told you about their ritual site, remember? See if they're hiding the book there and bring it back to me. From there? I don't yet know.
TTW00011444	I'm a bit short on caps at the moment.
TTW00011445	Perhaps you're in the wrong place? Do come back when you have the means.
TTW00011446	Yes, Desmond. But whose side is she on? Do you know? Can you be sure? You always were so bad at choosing your allies.
TTW00011447	I don't need eyes to know you're there. Come here!
TTW00011448	Yes, we shall be free of all limitations! Thank you, master. We shall be the instrument of your mighty will.
TTW00011449	Yes, fine, go destroy the house and its "impurities." Just stop that jammer, and I'll be free of you morons, once and for all!
TTW00011450	No need to worry, enlightened one. We shall re-consecrate the mansion, and remove the impurities disrupting your perfect guidance.
TTW00011451	No, not "astral knowledge" you simpleton! Psychic domination! And that still won't be possible until you destroy Desmond's jamming device.
TTW00011452	Yes, and you will be able to spread your knowledge across the astral plane for all those wise enough to accept it!
TTW00011453	Soon, your sacred land shall be cleared of all obstacles. No longer shall its mystical powers be diminished!
TTW00011454	I was drawn to your eternal wisdom.
TTW00011455	What splendid news! At last the holy land is empty of its destructive aurora, and the astral plain is open to us all.
TTW00011456	Oh, but the Transcendent Master will want to hear of this! And as the returning champion, it is your right and honor to tell him yourself.
TTW00011457	After all, it is he who makes all true decisions about the spiritual growth of our tribe, including the decision to cleanse the mansion.
TTW00011458	Batteries? For extra "kick"?
TTW00011459	You best keep this one to yourself, sweetie. The family tonic gets real kick from our secret ingredient. We just need a lil' bit of battery acid.
TTW00011460	Oh, don't look like that, now.
TTW00011461	You reckon I'd be around to tell you about it if it weren't safe enough? Bring me six fission batteries and I'll scrape 'em into the mix.
TTW00011462	I'd like to buy a ticket.
TTW00011463	Let's see what you've got to trade.
TTW00011464	I'm here to buy.
TTW00011465	Happy to oblige!
TTW00011466	I'm here to buy.
TTW00011467	At last! He's just ahead! I'll circle around and distract him. You take him from the front.
TTW00011468	Air Com, we have multiple flashpoints on horizon, come back?
TTW00011469	Air Command, USN Three-Five-Oh requesting landing vector. Have zero ceiling visbility and low on state, somebody get me a landing clearance.
TTW00011470	State One plus one zero to splash, have zero read on outer marker. This is USN Three-Five-Oh, I'm blind out here.
TTW00011471	Attempting Emergency Landing over water. INS pinger active on distress band. Flaps up, descent to eight cherubs. Three green, over.
TTW00011472	Five cherubs, treeline up, throttle easy on four lights. Prepping to pull the loud handle. <Static>
TTW00011473	All robots! Activate! Destroy Desmond!
TTW00011474	All in a day's work. Now share your wisdom with me!
TTW00011475	DEATH!
TTW00011476	I wanted to show Desmond that no one pushes me around.
TTW00011477	Well, I would have expected nothing less from you. And now, I have a very special gift:
TTW00011478	DEATH!
TTW00011479	That's right. So, what do I get for it?
TTW00011480	DEATH!
TTW00011481	Two days ago I was caught stealing from the groups' claim.
TTW00011482	Today, with the consent of my father, I am to be shot and killed on the cliffs of the old cathedral by the hands of my brother, Richard.
TTW00011483	With my execution, my punishment is exacted and the Adlam name will be avenged.
TTW00011484	Let my punishment be a reminder to those who may be tempted to do as I did.
TTW00011485	I usually hide my bodies in the river, but this is nice, too.
TTW00011486	We are nothing alike. More so than you could ever comprehend. Go now, and never return.
TTW00011487	Where do you get your stock from?
TTW00011488	I found some of it. Some was here when I got here. I get some from them mercs.
TTW00011489	And every once in a while, that weirdo with the boat comes up here and trades a few good things.
TTW00011490	Show me what you have for sale.
TTW00011491	Look around. It's all here.
TTW00011492	I got all sorts of stuff. Take a look.
TTW00011493	That's what I'm here for.
TTW00011494	All of Madam Panada's wares are top quality.
TTW00011495	And what is it you would like to purchase?
TTW00011496	Actually, I already took care of it.
TTW00011497	Well, I'll be. Here, let me give you something for your trouble.
TTW00011498	I haven't decided what I'm going to do with it yet.
TTW00011499	Surely you're not considering giving it to Marcella? Come now, the woman can't rub two caps together. Give it to me and be paid.
TTW00011500	May God shed his blessings upon you, child. Make haste for Dunwich.
TTW00011501	I'm gonna catch you!
TTW00011502	Okay, that's enough tag for now.
TTW00011503	Hehe. That was fun.
TTW00011504	Tag! You're It!
TTW00011505	I'll get you!
TTW00011506	Haha! Here I come!
TTW00011507	Look out!
TTW00011508	Tag! You're it! You'll never catch me!
TTW00011509	Hark! Who goes there?
TTW00011510	Dammit! Trapped! I knew he'd try this!
TTW00011511	He's just down this way!
TTW00011512	And now we say goodbye.
TTW00011513	I said another thing.
TTW00011514	We are talking.
TTW00011515	Hello yourself.
TTW00011516	What should I be doing?
TTW00011517	Don't be daft. You agreed to retrieve my book. With more haste than this, I would have thought.
TTW00011518	You need to head for the ritual site east of the boardwalk, and expect a fight.
TTW00011519	Sure, let's hear it.
TTW00011520	I'm afraid I don't have a copy of the scripture with me, but I can share a few passages. Here's one of my favorites.
TTW00011521	I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned;
TTW00011522	he has crossed over from death to life.
TTW00011523	My mother had a favorite passage from the Bible. Revelation 21:6 - recognize it?
TTW00011524	Of course! "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely."
TTW00011525	So lovely. Selflessness like that is a rare commodity these days. I can see why that particular passage inspired her.
TTW00011526	Leave me alone, okay?
TTW00011527	I appreciate the advice, but I'm fine, okay?
TTW00011528	You're not the boss of me.
TTW00011529	Sure, okay.
TTW00011530	Whatever.
TTW00011531	Yes, mother Woodrose.
TTW00011532	I try to, sir.
TTW00011533	Yes. Simple.
TTW00011534	As you say.
TTW00011535	Thank you. Be at peace.
TTW00011536	What do they want with us?
TTW00011537	Your guess is as good as mine. I can't understand what they're saying. I don't remember half of what they did to me, and that might be a good thing.
TTW00011538	I know we ain't the only ones; there's a whole bunch of us in here. They'll pluck folks out every now and then.
TTW00011539	So how do we get out of here?
TTW00011540	Okay, yeah. Let's do something about getting out.
TTW00011541	Well, there ain't no easy way out. Trust me, I've looked. Can't even find anything to pry open, see what's blocking the doorway.
TTW00011542	I'm thinkin' they did us a favor, putting us together in here like this. And I say we use it to our advantage.
TTW00011543	I think you should remain in the Engineering Core for now.
TTW00011544	Okay. Whatever you think is best.
TTW00011545	Putting me on guard duty, huh? Swell.
TTW00011546	Fine. If I see any aliens, I'll say hello for you.
TTW00011547	I may need an extra gun in the Hangar Bay. Can you lend a hand?
TTW00011548	Now you're speakin' my language. Hell yeah, I'll come with you.
TTW00011549	I need some help in the Robot Assembly area. You in?
TTW00011550	Heck yeah. I can take apart and put together a Protectron with my eyes shut. I'll go with you. Lead on.
TTW00011551	I need to get through the Cryo Labs. Think you can help me?
TTW00011552	Hmmm. Sounds like I may be of some use in there. If there are other people in stasis, I could help revive them or something. Just watch my back.
TTW00011553	Can you tell me more about where you're from?
TTW00011554	Does it really matter?
TTW00011555	I mean, we're fighting to stay alive here. Whatever I did before we got to this point doesn't mean a whole lot right now.
TTW00011556	Does it really matter?
TTW00011557	I mean, we're fighting to stay alive here. Whatever I did before we got to this point doesn't mean a whole lot right now.
TTW00011558	Looks like this door's locked, too. Hang on, I'll see if I can get it from the other side.
TTW00011559	I can't believe you killed him, he has it just as bad as us. I'll see you later.
TTW00011560	Status report?
TTW00011561	Fuck you and this whole fucking situation. They'll work when they work.
TTW00011562	What's this thing do?
TTW00011563	Hmm, looks like I'm at the helm. I'll have these controls figured out in no time at all.
TTW00011564	That's my squad in there! What the hell are the aliens doing to them?
TTW00011565	You green bastards! Get your hands off them!
TTW00011566	There has to be a way to release their containment seal! Maybe there's a button or something on this console.
TTW00011567	They're flanking us from behind. Quick, find some cover.
TTW00011568	So that's the generator. Now how the heck do we destroy it?
TTW00011569	Get a load of this!
TTW00011570	Wow!
TTW00011571	How's the jammer holding?
TTW00011572	It's holding fine for now, I guess. It should help with the bastards teleporting onto the ship.
TTW00011573	Hey, don't forget to put on the Astronaut's Suit before starting the decompression sequence.
TTW00011574	I got it! The deathray is working and will be fully charged in 30 seconds!
TTW00011575	20%. I hope you've got a plan.
TTW00011576	Can't be sure if I'm reading this right, but it looks like they're hitting us pretty hard. Hull integrity is at about 90%.
TTW00011577	Ship's at 30%. I hope you have something up your sleeve.
TTW00011578	At about 60%. Do something.
TTW00011579	30%. This is not good.
TTW00011580	Watch out, more are coming from behind you. I'll try to block their progress.
TTW00011581	It's obvious, isn't it? They're threatening us. You could tell just by the way he sounded.
TTW00011582	Are you kidding me? That was stupid of them. Now we know they're getting desperate.
TTW00011583	Give me a minute, I'll try to get these doors open for you.
TTW00011584	Wow, that looks dangerous. See if you can turn it off while I try and figure this door out.
TTW00011585	Uh-oh. I think they found a way to get to you. I'll try and get the next door open fast!
TTW00011586	More could bust in at any second. Get ready!
TTW00011587	I told you so! Ambush!
TTW00011588	We're almost out of here! I'll meet you up ahead. Hurry!
TTW00011589	I suppose you're right. Don't worry, they won't feel a thing.
TTW00011590	Wait! I think that's some more of my squad!
TTW00011591	Okay. Lets put these guys to use.
TTW00011592	No sense discussin’ it now.
TTW00011593	And how are we supposed to do that? We can’t understand what the hell they’re saying!
TTW00011594	He’s not going anywhere. Why don’t we just hold on to him, and try to negotiate? Y’know, like a hostage?
TTW00011595	Hmmm. Let me take some of this cryogenic compound back to the engine core. I might be able to make some use of it.
TTW00011596	Try hitting that button down there. It's flashing, it probably does something good.
TTW00011597	There's some alien goo tubes on that table over there. I've seen them use it to fix guns and stuff. I bet it'll work for you too.
TTW00011598	Go away, meanie! Just you wait 'till my friend gets here!
TTW00011599	Aliens! Look out!
TTW00011600	Cows? We got cows!
TTW00011601	Do you think you can make use of that stuff you picked up in the Cryo Labs?
TTW00011602	Yeah, I think so. Before I was shipped out to Anchorage, I was trained in cryoscience. We were hoping to apply that to medicine.
TTW00011603	The compounds we used weren't that different from this cryogenic liquid. I'm pretty sure I can make us some improvised weapons from it.
TTW00011604	Check back with me in about an hour and I'll see what I can do.
TTW00011605	Yeah, sure did. I was able to make a few cryo grenades and cryo mines.
TTW00011606	I can make more, but I'll need around three more hours. Keep checking back with me and I'll tinker with it.
TTW00011607	Were you able to come up with any cryogenic weapons?
TTW00011608	Here you go. Hope you're making good use of them. If you need more, I should have a batch ready in about three hours.
TTW00011609	Any more Cryo Grenades or Cryo Mines ready?
TTW00011610	Not yet. Still working on them.
TTW00011611	Any Cryo Grenades or Cryo Mines ready?
TTW00011612	Do you think we were noticed?
TTW00011613	Gas. Flammable gas.
TTW00011614	They're flooding the room with gas.
TTW00011615	Our situation didn't get any better by the looks of what happened here. I say we get the hell out of here.
TTW00011616	Curious, but I don't think I want to know the answer judging by what happened here. Let's not stay long, this place gives me the creeps.
TTW00011617	What kind of horses are these anyway? I can't see anyone havin' any respect ridin' into town on one of those things.
TTW00011618	What are they doing to the Buttercups?
TTW00011619	Oh wow. I remember these posters plastered all over the place back home.
TTW00011620	Giddyup.
TTW00011621	This is kind of disturbing.
TTW00011622	OK, this is getting a little ridiculous now.
TTW00011623	Look, even more of them. Buttercups that is.
TTW00011624	Huh, I wonder what they're doing with them.
TTW00011625	Hey look, Giddyup Buttercups! All the rich kids had them. Waste of money if you ask me.
TTW00011626	Now that looks like some tough ridin'. Those things real?
TTW00011627	Ow! All right! <Zap!> Ow! I said all right! Just stop!
TTW00011628	So it would seem I am aboard some vessel, suspended in the ether. Ironically, it would seem, so close to where I thought Heaven must surely lie.
TTW00011629	But this is not Heaven. And my captors are not angels. I am not entirely unconvinced that the scripture is wrong. That Heaven and Hell are reversed.
TTW00011630	For my captives are devils. Demons from my nightmares. Even now they watch me, make me talk.
TTW00011631	Ow! Stop it! I did what you said! You wanted me to talk, so I talked! Just leave me! Leave me be!
TTW00011632	We'll be at the engineering core in no time!
TTW00011633	Nuka what?
TTW00011634	Thirsty? Heh, I wonder if the aliens love this stuff as much we do down below.
TTW00011635	Nuka-Cola! You know, they came out with this stuff called Nuka-Cola Quantum way back. Now that was some powerful stuff. I can still taste it now.
TTW00011636	I wouldn't go jumpin' down there if I were you.
TTW00011637	Now that's what I call a trash chute. I wouldn't get too close, don't wanna fall in or anything.
TTW00011638	Well, that's one way to take out the garbage.
TTW00011639	Okay, here it is. Neat, huh?
TTW00011640	Wow, look at this place! It looks like the ship in Captain Cosmos!
TTW00011641	We're stuck. Let me see if I can figure something out.
TTW00011642	Wow! This looks just like the bridge on Captain Cosmos! I know what to do!
TTW00011643	Shit, they hit the core and sapped our power. Look around for some buttons or something to restart the generators.
TTW00011644	Lights out, they killed our power! Maybe there's some buttons or something around here to restart this hunk of junk.
TTW00011645	Things are flashing again! We got flashing things! You must be doing something right. Keep it up!
TTW00011646	Holy shit. Where did that come from?
TTW00011647	Just take it easy. If they wanted us dead, we'd be dead. They must need something from us.
TTW00011648	Hey! I said, calm down! If they hear you they may come for us. Try and take it easy!
TTW00011649	What are we gonna do? They just threw me in this cell with you after they poked and prodded me and now I just hope they won't kill us.
TTW00011650	Just take it easy. If they wanted us dead, we'd be dead. They must need something from us.
TTW00011651	Hey! I said, calm down! If they hear you they may come for us. Try and take it easy!
TTW00011652	NO! GET US THE HELL OUT OF HERE! <pounding noise> SOMEONE! GET US OUT! PLEASE! <pounding noise>
TTW00011653	Damn it. Their shields are back up at max.
TTW00011654	How's life in space?
TTW00011655	I told Mr. Elliott this really funny joke earlier, but he didn't get it. He's weird.
TTW00011656	What do you think the aliens want with us?
TTW00011657	Can you imagine? They made us and now they're pissed at us!
TTW00011658	Oh, great.
TTW00011659	All right, listen. Not that it's any of your damn business, but yeah. Before I got sucked up into crazy alien land here, I pulled some shady stuff.
TTW00011660	Many of my associates may or may not have been slavers, and I may or may not have received payment for helping them in their trade.
TTW00011661	Okay? Big secret exposed! Great job! Hope you're happy.
TTW00011662	There must be a reason you don't want to talk about yourself. What is it?
TTW00011663	A reason? Yeah, there's a reason. It's because I worked for slavers, okay? I worked for them, I helped them, and sometimes I liked it.
TTW00011664	They needed someone who was good with machines, stripping tech, building shit. That's me.
TTW00011665	So I did the work. And look where it got me. Now can we stop talking about me?
TTW00011666	You have to shut that off to open the door here.
TTW00011667	What the hell is this thing? What are we supposed to do with it?
TTW00011668	Now that I have a better understanding of the Family, may I speak to Ian?
TTW00011669	I had always assumed if a human happened upon our home, it would be for the purpose of our extermination.
TTW00011670	It appears my fears were ill-placed. It is a pleasant surprise to meet someone as amenable as yourself.
TTW00011671	Very well. I will allow you to speak to Ian. Perhaps you can help him come to grips with his greatest enemy. Himself.
TTW00011672	I already read your laws and I think I understand what you people are.
TTW00011673	Indeed? Tell me what you've learned from the Laws. What do you think we are?
TTW00011674	Have you heard the election results?
TTW00011675	I didn't win it, huh? Well, there'll always be other elections.
TTW00011676	Sorry you didn't win it, Rosie.
TTW00011677	There'll always be other elections.
TTW00011678	Sorry you didn't win it, Rosie.
TTW00011679	Who needs it. I'd prefer to be second in command anyway.
TTW00011680	Results are in. Better luck next year.
TTW00011681	So, what are the results, Mister President?
TTW00011682	The people have re-elected me as their president.
TTW00011683	It's great to see the democratic process at work.
TTW00011684	So, what are the results, Mister President?
TTW00011685	There was a tie. Under these unique circumstances, I'll have to remain the leader until we know the results for sure.
TTW00011686	So, what are the results, Mister President?
TTW00011687	Under these unique circumstances, I'll have to remain the leader until we know the results for sure.
TTW00011688	So, what are the results, Mister President?
TTW00011689	Let me get back to you on this.
TTW00011690	Very well, I've waited this long, a bit longer won't make much difference.
TTW00011691	In the meantime, allow me to get back to my calculations.
TTW00011692	Is there anywhere you can hide?
TTW00011693	Well, there is the personal shelter next to the old diner.
TTW00011694	I'll head over there and wait inside. Hurry back!
TTW00011695	Hey, you think you could get a campfire going here?
TTW00011696	Yeah, sure.
TTW00011697	Hey, boy. Go do your business and mark this spot so we can find this place again.
TTW00011698	<aroo?>
